As Scots argue about the Declaration of Arbroath, the 19th century
uprising is more significant

My estimable colleague Magnus Linklater recently asked in these pages
why plans this year to mark the 700th anniversary of the 1320
Declaration of Arbroath seemed so half-hearted. He recalled his mother,
Marjorie, while SNP agent in Orkney, reading the entire declaration to a
somewhat bemused audience at a party meeting.

‘With so many lodging choices, wine programs offer companies another way
to stand out.’

While overall wine sales have slowed in recent years, at least in the
United States, oenophiles have started to consume
more[https://wineanalyticsreport.com/report/january-2019-total-u-s-wine-market/]
— and
demand[https://wineanalyticsreport.com/report/january-2019-total-u-s-wine-market/]
— better quality wines. To attract this traveler, hotels and resorts are
increasingly ordering private-label bottles, producing their own and
ramping up wine-centric experiences.

Minutes before Elizabeth Warren’s arrival at a recent campaign stop in
Manchester, New Hampshire, a political enthusiast sitting in the packed
bleachers of a gymnasium recounts a previous time he asked the
Democratic presidential candidate a question.

“I asked her about better public school education, because in Detroit,
and some other places, public schools aren’t doing well,” the young man
explains.

Kia Motors on Tuesday unveiled its strategy to transform into a mobility
solutions provider and ramp up its lineup with 11 new models to achieve
global electric vehicle market share of 6.6 percent by 2025. Under its
mid- and long-term business plan called “Plan S,” the sister company of
Hyundai Motor said it will focus on EVs by injecting 29 trillion won
($25.1 billion), as well as increase profitability by offering
customized mobility solutions. The vision was unveiled during its
investor day event held in Seoul, in front of shareholders, analysts and
credit rating agency officials. “Amid the rapidly changing automotive
industry paradigm, this is the time when we can completely transform
ourselves as a global company that leads future values for customers,”
said Kia Motors CEO Park Han-wu. He added that Kia hopes to achieve 6
percent growth in operating profit and 10.6 percent return on equity by
2025.

CEO Ray Blanchette told Business Insider that the restaurant industry
should push for immigration reform — especially as companies deal with
record-low unemployment rates.

* "150 years ago, an immigrant would come here and work in
infrastructure," Blanchette said in an interview at the ICR Conference
in Orlando, Florida, on Monday. "Building the country was roads or
railroads or skyscrapers — those were the jobs that were available to
immigrants. Today ... we are the place where immigrants break the cycle
of poverty for their families forever."

Try selling a brightly colored paisley pattern quilted cotton handbag to
anyone below the age of 40. Paisley doesn't exactly scream "hot
Millennial trend!"

But for Vera Bradley, the paisley pattern is its identity. The company
has attracted an almost cult-like following for its cotton handbags,
backpacks and wallets which are often splashed with every kind of
paisley pattern imaginable. There's a "Fireworks Paisley," a "Daisy Dot
Paisley," and even a whimsical "Mickey and Minnie Paisley."

Quicken, one of the first companies to come out with money management
software — it started with an MS-DOS version that ran on the Apple II in
1983 — launched Tuesday a stripped-down app for millennials called Simplifi.

“In this day and age, it's so easy to spend and not think about it,”
said Kristen Dillard, director of product management at Quicken. “This
app is geared towards helping those customers manage all of their
finances in one place, but really keep an eye on their spending so they
can make sure they're spending less than they're bringing in and
spending on what's important to them, in a way that helps them achieve
their longer-term financial goals.”

Sen. Elizabeth Warren proposed Tuesday to ease federal student loan debt
with executive authority, in a policy rollout aimed at attracting young
voters.

The Massachusetts Democrat said that as president, she would not wait
for Congress to approve her plans to cancel or modify federal student
debt. Instead, she would directly authorize the Department of Education
to provide as much as $50,000 in relief for about 95% of student loan
borrowers.

There was no way Doug and Lydia Hanna were going to be caught unprepared
when the calendar flipped to Jan. 1, 2020.

For much of 2018, the couple journeyed from thrift store to thrift store
in Louisville, Ky., carefully scouring the aisles for the colorful DVD
boxes featuring their favorite sitcom buddies. A few months and just $47
later, the couple had stacked up all 10 seasons -- all 40 discs, all 236
episodes -- of what Mrs. Hanna calls, "the best show to rewatch -- over
and over again."

By 2030, the baby boomer generation, the most influential of our time,
will have reached its full retirement age.

Among the main reasons why the crunch does not leave the French streets
is the proposal to raise the retirement age to receive a full pension
from 62 to 64. A measure that has been attacked by yellow vests, trade
unionists and workers and that has finally been paralyzed, at least
provisionally, for the peace of mind of all of them. In Spain, with the
start of the new year, the legal retirement age is already 65 years and
ten months, within the gradual evolution that will lead us to retire
(for now) at 67 years.

Kumar Mangalam Birla, Chairman of the Aditya Birla Group, said that the
conflicting forces of globalization and nationalism are making
governments and corporations rethink their priorities and are forcing
them to come up with new constructs. "In a post globalized world,
communities and people will find themselves on either side of an
increasingly stark divide between winners and losers," he said in a
personal statement published on Linkedin.

“As globalization makes way for ‘slowbalization,’ the emerging pattern
of trend is more regional," he said. "While the march of globalization
is perhaps inevitable, what is certain is that the world is no longer
flat. One needs to look no further than Novelis and Birla Carbon to
appreciate this mega-trend," he added. Birla believes that Greta
Thunberg could well be the conscience of *Gen Z*. “You can agree with
them. You can disagree with them. But you can no longer ignore them.”
the billionaire said.

Demetrius Harrison, a 21-year-old college student and promotions
specialist in Louisville, Kentucky, submitted his application for the
new Apple
Card[https://www.forbes.com/advisor/credit-cards/reviews/the-apple-credit-card/]
around its debut in September. As a frequent Apple Pay user, with only
one other credit card (a student
card[https://www.forbes.com/advisor/credit-cards/best/student/]) to his
name, Harrison thought it would be a great opportunity to build his credit.

The only problem: his application for the Apple card was denied.

New Delhi, Jan. 14 -- The new decade, Kumar Mangalam Birla believes,
will see the world dealing with the consequences of globalization and
its discontent with the phenomena. He also believes that globalization
will make way for 'slowbalisation', the emerging pattern of trade which
is more regional with multiple local operations.

In a personal statement published on Linkedin this morning, Birla, the
head of the $48 billion Aditya Birla group, said, "The tension between
nationalism and globalization is reshaping the world and, will perhaps
be the most defining trend as we head into a new decade.. When Thomas
Friedman coined the phrase the world is flat, the world was a very
different place. Back then he opined that technology and geopolitics
were reshaping our lives while we were sleeping. Now that we are wide
awake, I see a very different world, dealing with the consequences of
globalization and its discontent."

Bangladesh, Jan. 14 -- Klaus Schwab helped initiate the World Economic
Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, from 1971. Two years later he
presented a 'Davos Manifesto' about capitalism that he is now, in
January 2020, re-modelling. He now calls it a 'stakeholder capitalism',
where the stakes are all that led the 15-year old Swedish school-girl,
Greta Thunberg, to launch a worldwide movement, and win the Time
personality recognition to end 2019 with (see Scopus, December 12,
2019), among other dynamics. This is Schwab's third type of capitalism:
from 'shareholder capitalism' to 'state capitalism', and now
'stakeholder capitalism'. Scopus readers might recall the last issue
discussed two types of Branco Milanovic's capitalism (from which both he
and Scopus tried to squeeze out a third version, yet in vain). Schwab
might be resolving that third type through his 'stakeholder'' version.

2020 has arrived, and experts weigh in on megatrends that will shape
investments over the next 10 years

AS WE step into a fresh decade, questions loom large in investors'
minds. Those who stayed invested over the past decade would have been
richly rewarded, despite worries over a myriad of risks including the
path of interest rates, various domestic elections, protectionism and
more recently the trade war.

By Kaushik PrasadIn 18th-century Europe, potatoes were considered a
leprosy-inducing invention of the devil and this belief was particularly
pernicious in France. So, no-one ate them. Yet, the humble tuber might
not have attained its preeminent status in European cuisine if not for a
French pharmacist named Antoine-Augustin Parmentier.As a prisoner-of-war
in Prussia, Parmentier was starved for long periods and when fed, it was
boiled potato mash, considered slops by his jailers. This was his moment
of epiphany, when he realised that potatoes were cheap, healthy and
tasty, and could be the solution to the massive famines that swept
through France. He decided to make popularising potatoes his life’s
mission.Upon his return to France, Parmentier embarked on a series of
experiments to prove that potatoes were perfectly nutritious. He
published a treatise and presented it to the scientific academy.

PASADENA, Calif. – Ethan Hawke has a long and storied career as an
actor, but he's also a fan of a new rising actress on the scene: his
daughter, Maya.

"I knew when she was a kid that she was – all parents feel this way –
but I felt that she was an artist really young," Hawke said at the
Television Critics Association Monday. "She’s a substantive human being
and it keeps my life interesting and exciting to try to be the person
that she wants me to be. "

Forget Mike Wheeler; there’s a new guy in Millie Bobby Brown’s life. The
‘Stranger Things’ star, 15, just revealed in a new pic that she’s dating
rugby player Joseph Robinson, 17!

It’s on! Stranger Things’ Millie Bobby Brown has a new boyfriend, a year
and a half after her breakup from musical.ly star Jacob Sartorius.
Millie, 15, and Joseph Robinson, 17, the son of England Rugby World Cup
legend Jason Robinson, seemingly confirmed things on Snapchat, posing
for a cute photo captioned “Ly x.” That means “love you,” if you don’t
speak *Gen Z*. In the mirror selfie, Joseph is standing behind Millie
with his hands wrapped around her waist, as Millie clasps his hand and
sticks out her tongue. Ah, young love. The couple apparently met in
November 2019 in the Maldives, a vacation Millie previously called “the
trip of a lifetime” on Instagram.

Royal couple's brand will be able to 'sustain them at a level most
American celebrities can only dream of' putting them in the highest
echelons of fame and fortune alongside Beyoncé and Jay Z

After Meghan Markle and Prince Harry announced they would be forging a
new identity separate from that of the royal family, it raised questions
about what the couple's life would be like going forward.

New televisions at the CES gadget show in Las Vegas were more diverse
this year than they have been in a long time. Beyond the 8K resolution
hoopla, panel technologies ranged from MiniLED and MicroLED to souped up
OLEDs, making things much more interesting than usual. So which ones
stood out from the crowd? Here's four of my favourites.

The "Quality of Life" Program 2020, one of the main pillars of Vision
2030, aims to improve the lifestyle of individuals and families in the
Kingdom. This is achieved by enhancing the participation of citizens in
cultural, entertainment, sports and other activities that contribute to
the quality of life and promote the status of Saudi cities globally.

Essential to achieving this is creating vibrant communities in which
individuals and families interact and engage with one another and their
physical environment. Unlike the traditional makeup of cities, where
residential, commercial, retail and hospitality assets were
unintegrated, 21st century living calls for urban masterplans that
facilitate a social mix through incorporating all asset classes within
communities. These must offer quality basic and lifestyle services with
public spaces for all to boost the physical, psychological, and digital
health of the Vision 2030 generation.

The symbol was removed in a Connecticut town. Now, newly empowered
Republicans are restoring it.

In July, the school board in a small Connecticut town called Killingly
took what local officials said was a long-overdue step: removing the
name of the school mascot, Redmen, which some Native Americans have
deemed racist.

New Delhi, Jan 13 (IANSlife) Peer pressure, social media and a host of
new age ailments have resulted in the '"ear of missing out" (FOMO).
Millennials, boomers and *Generation Z* are feeling it the most. Each
time one says "yes" to something in the fear of feeling left out.

This results in one abandoning their own path by pretending or
proclaiming to admire what is currently popular or widely discussed.
It's all about courage; courage is what one needs to stay your course
and gratitude for your own path to keep one grounded.

For many college students, political beliefs have become a compatibility
issue while dating

Last year during Christmas, Debarati Ghosh, a student of Sri
Shikshayatan College, went to a night club and met Rounak (name changed
on request). She liked him instantly. The way he behaved, looked and
smiled were enough to woo her. "But problems started as we started
talking. I learnt that he was a fan of certain political figures and
would support them no matter how wrong they were. It was an instant
turn-off for me and a few days and a few fights later, I stopped talking
to him altogether," she said.

Late last year, the St. Scholastica's College Manila Ma. Fe Perez-Agudo
(MFPA) Center for Leadership Excellence held its second annual thought
leadership workshop for student leaders. Fifty-two promising students
from Grades 7-12 participated to hone their leadership skills and become
an inspiration to others.

The MFPA Leadership Center partnered with 2017 Ramon Magsaysay awardee,
the Philippine Educational Theater Association (PETA), to highlight this
year's theme, Inspire to Lead. PETA used the fundamentals of theater and
storytelling to teach the workshop participants to be critical,
communicative, and creative in dealing with the problems facing their
generation.

No! This is neither about the most influential celebrity talk show host
Oprah Winfrey nor an analysis of the mystical princess Odette from the
classical ballet Swan Lake and why it is considered as one of the
greatest ballets of all time.

In today’s Arias, allow me to introduce to you millennials, the musical
genius and legacy of the statuesque and almost like a supermodel for
real, Ms. Odette Quesada.

In recent years, there has been a dramatic change in the workplace;
amongst the workforce and in their workstyle. And this revolution is
only set to accelerate, with technology continuing to be a hugely
disruptive force to the everyday meeting experience. In fact, the past
few years have seen an explosion of meeting room technology.

The use of technology and the digitalisation of each sector will have a
fundamental impact on the trends of 2020 in the workplace, especially in
the UAE. With the UAE continuing to embrace digitalisation and ranking
1st in the Arab region and 12th globally, advancing five positions from
2018, according to IMD World Digital Competitiveness Ranking 2019
report, there is little evidence of a slowdown.
