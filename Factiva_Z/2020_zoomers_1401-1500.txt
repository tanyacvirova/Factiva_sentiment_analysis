Charleston, S.C. — Benefitfocus, Inc. (NASDAQ: BNFT), a leading
cloud-based benefits management platform and services provider published
findings from its’ observations derived from the review of anonymized
behaviors of four million U.S. employees. Employers that drive an
active, year-round benefits experience could be rewarded with up to a 37
percent lower employee turnover rate than their peers.

In a Benefit Insight Brief released today based on anonymized data from
476 corporations with more than 100 full-time employees within the
Benefitfocus customer base, companies could see a potential decrease in
employee turnover of up to 37 percent. The Work Institute, a leader in
employee retention programs, estimates that the average cost to an
employer of losing a U.S. worker is $15,000. Based on this estimate and
the analysis for this brief, a company with 10,000 employees that
reduces turnover by 10 percent could retain 70 workers, for a savings of
just over a million dollars.

Founded 107 years ago as the Electro-Alkaline Co. with an initial
investment of $500 in Oakland, Calif., the firm launched with just one
product: Clorox liquid bleach. Horse-drawn wagons delivered the
returnable five-gallon jugs of the chemical concoction to clean
industrial equipment.

The now Procter & Gamble-owned brand has expanded into a slew of other
household cleaning supplies with and without bleach. Clorox also has
changed its look several times since the company’s inception.

‘ Swag se solo’, ahead of the February 14 - otherwise also known as the
Valentine’s Day. The campaign featuring actor Salman Khan - who is also
the brand ambassador celebrates ‘Singletons’ and the feelings associated
with being single. “Pepsi is a brand that understands the pulse of the
youth and we have always tried to engage with the young generation in a
way that is relatable. ‘Swag se solo’, is a take on GenZ’s attitude
towards life and relationships,” PepsiCo India spokesperson, said in an

Last week, wellness brand The Nue Co. launched its biggest campaign to
date via both online and offline activations.

The brand is promoting a new collection called The One Daily, which is
its attempt to unbundle the multivitamin category from a single product,
to seven. Compared to its first out-of-home
campaign[https://www.glossy.co/beauty/supplement-company-the-nue-co-redirects-advertising-spend-to-out-of-home-campaigns]
in October 2019, the new campaign budget is 400% larger, said Jules
Miller, The Nue Co. founder and CEO. It consists of wild postings,
subway ads and billboards, influencer marketing and a pop-up store in
New York City’s SoHo neighborhood. The Nue Co. has grown steadily since
its launch in 2017 — it raised $9 million in a Series A round in June
2019 — and e-commerce sales increased by 250% in 2019.

Holed up as I am at a wellness clinic in the Bavarian Alps (OK, it’s not
really a wellness clinic, it’s just a hotel in the mountains with hot
tubs and a salad bar, but it’s as close as I’m ever going to get), I
thought I might as well go on a diet. More for something to do than out
of any major desperation. I’m currently hovering around a perfectly
acceptable 12st 5lb, but away filming for a week in a place with a good
gym and all food silliness catered for at the wave of a hand, I have a
fair chance, if I apply myself, of hitting my dream weight of 12st 1lb
by the weekend and perhaps even achieving my life’s ambition of a scales
reading that begins with 11.

“Yes, but you can’t talk about it or write about it,” said a young
member of the crew. “Or you’ll be thin-shamed for being anti-BoPo.”

* Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign has been on the upswing for the past few
months, and he's faced attacks on all sides as a result.

* Though critics of Sanders have suggested he's not a true Democrat,
given he serves Vermont as an independent in the Senate, this just
doesn't seem to matter to younger, progressive voters.

A tale of two cities that dress as one? The suits, sweater vests and
polar fleeces typical of Midtown Manhattan office lunch lines are being
imitated with a certain irony downtown, where creative circles have
begun “festishizing” the yuppie wardrobe.

A generation of creative freelancers with little more exposure to 9-to-5
culture than reruns of “The Office” are finding new appeal in Eighties
preppy and yuppie codes. Louche pin-striped slacks, argyle sweater vests
and loafers have become a cool, genderless uniform for a youth that is,
ironically enough, increasingly disillusioned by the large corporations
where these styles originated.

Content has always been free flowing. Its malleability is what defines
it. Hence, it is only natural that it adapts itself to whatever vessel
carries it.

During the last couple of decades, media, the vessel itself, has evolved
and continues to do so. Media has broken away from being defined by
restrictions - from the letter-bound restrictions of print to
video-based restrictions of radio to geography-based restrictions of
television broadcast - to being defined by freedom of access, of choice,
and of interaction. During the course of this media revolution, content
itself has had to adapt and grow accordingly.

(Expansion) – With the implementation of the T-MEC planned for the end
of the year, Mexico should focus on positioning its automotive industry
for the next decade and beyond.Ambitious targets for electric car
production could lead to 30% of light vehicles in Europe and 5% in the
United States a reality by 2025, according to a UBS study. With
Denmark's announcement last year, around a dozen countries plan to ban
the sale of petrol and diesel-powered cars by 2030-2040. Sometime
between 2035 and 2050, depending on who is being consulted, all cars and
trucks could be electric.

By then the question of whether cars will have drivers or even
individual owners would also be on the table. In fact, as millennials
and *generation Z* avoid ownership of cars in favor of Ubers, electric
bikes, and other forms of transportation sharing, overall car sales are
likely to continue to decline.

The reign of princess frocks is over last night saw the rise of the red
carpet warrior. Leading ladies and men wore armour, capes and *Gen Z*
suits. Karen Dacre salutes their style

SUPERHEROES wear capes and so do Hollywood's leading women. Following a
quick audit of last night's Academy Awards' red carpet, the superhero's
favoured outerwear choice emerges victorious as does Natalie Portman, an
Oscars night wonder woman. An exercise in fashion activism (or virtue
signalling depending on your point of view), Portman's cape a bespoke
creation crafted by Dior's Maria Grazia Chiuri had been quietly
embroidered with the names of the female directors "snubbed" by the
Academy. But surely it's the presence of a cape as a red-carpet regular
that is the real activism here, with the long-term Dior ambassador
choosing to, quite literally, shield herself from the glare of the world.

It's never too early to start thinking about saving for your retirement.
But if you're a part of Generation X or a young Baby Boomer, the need to
start putting away money for your Golden Years is more urgent.

Many financial advisers tell investors to move more of their money into
conservative, safe haven investments like bonds and money market
accounts as they get older.

incorporates a unisex design with four variants: Polar Kick, Daisy
Power, Fresh Spin and Fruit Spin.

Lloyd Moffat, creative director PB Creative said: “Rexona is the leading
efficacy anti-perspirant brand. Our challenge was to deliver the brand’s
authority in this area without creating designs that appeared too
clinical to the *Generation Z* target audience. As a result, we’ve
created a cosmopolitan and engaging set of unisex designs for a diverse
global teen community.”

Did Saoirse Ronan upstage Scarlett Johansson? Margot Robbie or Charlize

And just what did Billy Porter wear this time?

The Oscars 2020 ceremony took place at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood,
Los Angeles, drawing the award season close to a glittering close on the
morning of February 10, Hong Kong time. As the stars go head-to-head for
the golden statue, as usual, STYLE steps out onto red carpet in
screening the biggest wins and losses on their outfits.

In the current turbulent global political climate, a job or a career for
life for those just starting out in the workplace is no longer
guaranteed — or even desirable. Add in the climate crisis and wider
anxiety about the future, and the feeling of worry and lack of control
could potentially become overwhelming.

WITH internet-savvy millennial and *Gen Z* seeking an end to invasive
questions while booking their stay, a survey has revealed that more than
72 percent respondents prefer 'couple-friendly' hotels for short
duration stays.Over 72 per cent respondents picked a couple-friendly
hotel for shorter duration stays, be it for 'daycations' (brief duration
day stay) or an overnight stay, as per the survey by online travel
company Goibibo.It further revealed that more than 46 percent of the
hotel bookings came from couples residing in the same city, whereas
about 54 per cent were made for hotels located at an outstation
destination. The pan-India online survey was commissioned by Goibibo's
Consumer Insights among 1,000 respondents (couples in the age group of
22 to 26 years). Further, the survey found that 50 per cent respondents
had booked couple-friendly hotels more than five times in the last one year.

EVERY January, without fail, the hand-wringing begins. After predictably
poor Christmas retail results, everyone wants to know: are we seeing the
death of the high street? The gloom doesn't stop. Last week, the boss of
John Lewis was the latest to lament the retail landscape, warning of
potential store closures and job losses.

Why are we still questioning the high street's future? Haven't thousands
of shop closures, the disappearance of household names, and the
hollowing out of our town centres taught us anything? It's a bit like
commentators in 2045 asking "is climate change a real problem?" when the
first coastal town in Norfolk disappears under water.

When the gyrations in the financial markets attract the attention of
those not normally concerned with such matters, market lore says it's
time for the cognoscenti to beware.

Supposedly, when Joseph Kennedy Sr. started hearing stock tips from his
shoeshine boy in 1929, he figured it was time to get out of the market.
More recently, celebrities such as Barbra Streisand were angling for
allocations of initial public offerings at the peak of the dot-com boom
at the end of the past century.

*Zoomer* is owned by the Erskine family, and the race was one of many

issue – pay raises for two of the state Democratic Party’s biggest
allies, teachers and state workers.

Democrats and union officials said the GOP’s motives may be to deflect
campaign criticism this fall, or even to sow dissent among labor groups
jostling over the size of a rare pay hike.

As the seat touching the ground in a stuck up and down, the toy industry
has stalled in the face of the exponential advancement of video games.
The behaviour of consumers increasingly eager for technology has been
reflected in the finances of companies in both publicly traded sectors.

Barbie's fortune disappearsMattel, a company that saw its best years in
the 1990s, has lost ground due to its inability to compete with new
market charges. The fortune that the company amassed with brands such as
Barbie and Hot Wheel's has fallen since 1998, when the company reached
its higher capitalization value.

? American presidential pre-candidate Bernie Sanders is the one who
attracts millennials the most. Photo Afp El 70 percent of millennials
and/or generation Y, who were born after 1980, they tend to vote for a
socialist, even though the term socialism is anathema in the US and of
which the re-energized Trump, after the failed impeachment, has made his
shot at propaganda target to fly the goodness of Wall Street capitalism
that has brought his actions into the stratosphere, in contrast to its
economy that exhibits a patent mediocrity - except for the aristocratic
digitalic economy of Silicon Valley.

Young people in the US have lost faith in capitalism and now embrace
socialism, while Bernie Sanders' main health care proposal, a
self-confessed Democratic Socialist, who waves the health care flag for
all who has attracted millennials and moved the Democratic Party
significantly (https://bit.ly/3bllP72[https://bit.ly/3bllP72]) to the left.

If Indians wear their heart on one sleeve, they wear their politics on
the other.

Over 90% of young Indian men and women believe it is important to stay
informed about political issues and current affairs, according to data
collected by American dating platform OkCupid from its users. Voting was
also important to these 25- to 35-year-olds, as was participating in
protests.

exactly is love'

Valentine's is just around the corner, one of the most awaited occasions
for couples. The day to celebrate as well as indulge in this thing we
call Love. But what exactly is Love? It is very interesting to evaluate
how Love is perceived and defined these days. Here I will not say
millennials or *Gen Z* because Love is not something which happens in a
particular time frame, age or stage of life.

Love is timeless and limitless; it is us who sets boundaries. This
simple four letter word tends not to be that simple. Most of the times
the issue is that two individuals may have a different definition for
the same concept. For instance, one may say it is the intricate
emotional vulnerability towards each other, being completely naked and
exposed to each other in terms of your deepest secrets and darkest
fantasies once the threshold of friendship is crossed, it is showing
that vulnerable and organic side of yours that is otherwise at no one's
disposal. It is friendship on fire.

Monday's Oscars promise to be the most tedious in years; no biting host
to mock Hollywood egos or spark Twitter outrage; war snoozer 1917 tipped
to take the top prize; and acting categories whose winners have long
been decided (check your PO boxes, Joaquin and Renee).

But what it lacks in suspense, it should make up for with smaller
delights. Small like Margot Robbie's chances at a best supporting
actress win. Small like Joe Pesci's shadow at dawn. Small like my
interest in ever seeing something called Ford v Ferrari. Small like...
fine, you get it.

Single life in your twenties is a rite of passage, but what happens when
you find yourself back in the fray in later life? In an exclusive
survey, Style spoke to more than 1,000 single men and women aged 35 to
81 to discover the new rules of dating

Dating is an aDventure at any age — nerve-racking, exhausting, crushing
and occasionally wonderful — but maybe even more so in midlife. The
stakes are higher, whether you're looking for a life partner and
co-parent, or emerging from a long-term relationship with new clarity
about what you want from the rest of your life. In a landmark survey
commissioned by Style, more than 1,000 single men and women over the age
of 35 talked frankly about their dating experiences: what they're
looking for, how they go about finding it and, crucially, how it feels.
The results make clear that, in 2020, the dating landscape for midlifers
is even more Wild West than it is for many gen Zers.

Shruti Mishra, a 19-year-old Delhi University student, has witnessed the
Aam Aadmi Party’s education pitch playing out in front of her as she is
a product of a Delhi government school. With this experience in hand,
the first-time voter cast her vote in Munirka Saturday. “The classes now
have CCTVs, broken furniture is fixed immediately and schools are
cleaner than before. These are important issues that matter,” she said.

Low-rise jeans are coming back in 2020, say fashion pundits. In
anticipation of the return of one of denim’s darkest phases, here’s a
throwback to an era of 'muffin tops’, 'bum cleavages’ and total pelvic
access1993 THE RISE OF THE LOW-RISEOur fashion fates were sealed in
1993, on the day designer Alexander McQueen debuted a pair of bum
crack-baring jeans, aptly named “bumsters”, down the runway. “It wasn’t
about showing the bum. To me, that part of the body – not so much the
buttocks - but the bottom of the spine, that’s the most erotic part of
anyone’s body, man or woman,” the late McQueen said about his first-ever
collection at the time.While their 'erotic’ element may be debatable,
their 'iconic’ element certainly isn’t.(A model in 'bumsters’, designed
by Alexander McQueen in the early ’90s)“The bumster caused a sensation
when it was launched in the early nineties,” says the Metropolitan
Museum of Art curator Andrew Bolton, who worked on McQueen’s
retrospective in 2010.

In this day of smartphones and remote-working policies, many companies
are going 'asset-light' and allowing personal devices (cell phones,
laptops, etc.) for official use. Use of self-owned cell phones to access
work emails, WhatsApp for business and work, Excel or PPT files,
browsing Facebook or Instagram, Googling, Gmailing, Skyping, booking
Uber rides, finding Airbnb hosts and ordering app-based food deliveries
are now more the norm for millennials and their successors - the *Gen Z*.

This is raising interesting questions around individual privacy,
implementation of system controls on, and access to, employees'
self-owned devices by employers, either for usage screening or
regulatory purposes. For example, the Securities and Exchange Board of
India (Sebi) has increasingly been asking for phone logs (call logs,
emails, chats, etc.) from listed companies in cases involving insider
trading or front running allegations - what if personal phones were
involved (they often are).

I got the idea for this article from another article on Forbes.com
titled: 'Millennials Hate Phone Calls, And They Have A Point.'

I didn't think 'they have a point' before I started reading the Forbes
article, and still didn't after I'd read the piece. What can I say is:
I'm not a fan of texting. But in the interest of fairness, I thought,
why not look into this subject a little further.

Aims to reach people not interested in traditional places of worship

It might be named after the last letter in the alphabet, but a Winnipeg
pastor hopes his new congregation will be the beginning of something for
people who don't have much experience with the Christian church.

It's not unusual for teenagers to have intense friendships with other
young people they only talk to online. Do parents need to worry? Anna
Maxted reports

Isabella, 14, is best friends with Sapphire, 15. Sapphire is the first
person Isabella contacts when she's feeling anxious or stressed or when
her mum is nagging about homework and it's all too much. They have been
close for more than a year, but they have never been in the same room.
They don't even live on the same continent.

08.02.2020 The Hashar Week project was first implemented in March 2019.
Its main goal is to attract the attention of the government, the general
public, private enterprises and citizens to global environmental
problems, in particular to the issue of waste.

The project was implemented jointly by a private enterprise LLC SVD
Advisory, the State Committee of the Republic of Uzbekistan on Ecology
and Environmental Protection, representatives of a number of business
structures and international organizations. The Hashar Week project is
currently at the stage of obtaining NGO status.

OUR GO HARD OR GO HOME MENTALITY CAN OFTEN LEAD TO FAILURE Around this
time of year, most of us start to fall off the wagon. The meal prepping
we so fervently kicked the year off with is replaced with bought
lunches, the Pilates classes we booked a week in advance get cancelled
and the alcohol-free days we pencilled in start to drop off. Our sports
bras go unworn and our probiotics go unswallowed in favour of Uber Eats
and re-watching season eight of Grey’s Anatomy.

So why exactly does this happen every single year? Well, it’s generally
because you went out too hard.

Millennial’s look to refinancing MILLENNIAL homeowners are cashing in on
historically low home loan interest rates and are jumping at the chance
to refinance their mortgages.

Once labelled the lazy generation, Millennials are shaping up to be a
financially savvy bunch.

Radio New Zealand's bizarre decision (The Press, Feb 6) to axe the
enormously personalised, interactive Concert Programme as we know it and
replace it with an impersonal digital elevator-music format should be
reconsidered by wiser and more democratic heads. To sack all its
engaging hosts and use taxpayers' money to instead set up an Auckland
radio/online "radical sharing" alternative that would be more appealing
to the non-white youth market is simply absurd, short-sighted and surely
in breach of its charter of "reflecting New Zealand's cultural identity"
and "recognising the interests of all age groups".

There are already dozens of radio outlets targeting young people with
*Gen Z* "Zoomers" music (including NZ bands). But everyone knows most
people under 35 don't listen to radio outside workplaces and aren't
likely to start now.

To Cedillo, focusing on abortion through a legal lens leaves out
discussion of root causes, like the costs of child care, health care,
and the accessibility of affordable housing and social programs, that
can lead women to consider the procedure at all. The Pew survey showed
that same age group's support even higher: 70% favoring legal abortion -
an increase of roughly 15 percentage points above Americans 50 and older
- versus 29% opposed. According to the PRRI study, Catholic millennials
are nearly evenly split, with 46% saying abortion should be legal versus
48% who support making it illegal, which flips the percentages of
Catholics overall (48% support legality vs. 46% opposing). The PRRI
study attributes higher support for legal abortion among *Gen Z* to
higher proportions of Hispanics born in the U.S. Jackson said recent
survey trends have shown the Hispanic population as more conservative
than other groups on abortion views.

When Adrian Cheng looks across Hong Kong’s harbor from Tsim Sha Tsui, he
sees his family’s legacy writ large across the city’s skyline. There,
from a balcony atop the new luxury apartment building of his Victoria
Dockside development, he can view the Hong Kong Convention and
Exhibition Centre on the opposite side of the harbor.

With its curved glass and massive sloping roof, the convention center is
said to resemble a bird taking flight. His grandfather Cheng Yu-tung,
founder of the family’s flagship property firm New World Development,
came up with the ambitious plan for the building, which included a
manmade island, back in the early 1980s when the market was in a slump
and other developers had no interest. Undeterred, Yu-tung turned the
convention center into a Hong Kong icon, showcasing New World’s
capabilities. Yu-tung reportedly once said the convention center was one
of the two projects of which he was most proud.

with *Gen Z*

TikTok is the rare recent example of a new app that’s taken off globally
with millions of young people. The question is why.

Those who have studied TikTok attribute its breakout success — it’s been
downloaded more than 1.7 billion times to date — to its ability to lure
users down a digital rabbit hole of seemingly endless
entertainment. TikTok appeals to *Gen Z* , according to experts, because
of the way it’s been designed from the very beginning; it emphasizes
short-form video content, it’s easy to use and it’s even easier to go
viral on the app than other more established social media platforms. It
also feeds in perfectly to *Gen Z*’s desire for entrepreneurship and
being a creator.

Last month’s assassination of Iranian General Qasem
Soleimani[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-50979463], and
recent news of the US killing an al-Qaeda leader in
Yemen[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/06/world/middleeast/terror-yemen-drone-attack.html],
focused Americans’ attention on the Middle East and shed light on the
extent to which the United States relies on drone strikes in its foreign
policy. As the Council’s January survey
showed[https://www.thechicagocouncil.org/publication/americans-feel-less-safe-after-killing-soleimani],
more Americans say Soleimani’s killing makes the United States less safe
(47%) than more safe (28%), with 22 percent saying it makes no difference.

There are a few occasions when all it takes is ambition, hard work and
the right connections to transform a dream into reality. Although
Norwegian TV personality Rolf Arne Leer launched his "love letter" to
New York City three years ago, the awareness and acceptance of his
Quoted magazine is recently gaining traction, particularly among New
York City influencers and advertisers thanks to his associations with
the advertising community.

The print-only "for influencers by influencers" platform serves as *Gen
Z*'s iteration of cult trend-setting magazines Nylon or Paper. Each
issue features NYers expressing their hopes, dreams and aspirations. "We
all have our truth, and I've always been fascinated by the diversity of
New York and all the stories that hide behind closed doors," says Leer.
"Quoted Magazine has one simple philosophy: free your truth."

India, Feb. 7 -- 2019 witnessed many disruptive technologies emerge and
make headlines worldwide. Technologies like Artificial Intelligence,
Machine Learning, Cloud Computing, Block Chain, IoT and many more got
adopted by the customers. At the same time, customers were seen moving
back to on premise infrastructure with HCI like infrastructure. Many
more Apps and Chat Bots got developed and adopted by the customers to
eliminate latency and seamless computing and communication. However,
some technologies including Container Technology and Block Chain saw a
big hype. Therefore 2020 looks to be very interesting as many
technologies which hare in the nascent stage would definite mature and
some technologies would be phased out.

Summit[https://www.hrmagazine.co.uk/article-details/emotions-are-vital-in-the-workplace]

refreshing.

According to Mediakix, brands will spend $5 billion to $10 billion on
influencer marketing in 2020. In an attempt to earn their part of this
pot of gold, influencers are scrambling to prove to brands that they're
worthy of those marketing dollars.

Unfortunately, some have turned to unscrupulous tactics to build their
followers, and brands have uncovered some influencers who have those
dreaded, "fake followers."

released Friday.

Compared to January 2019, national housing inventory declined 13.6%-the
largest fall in more than four years-to the lowest level since

In this space, I recently
professed[https://www.bizjournals.com/memphis/news/2020/01/28/memphis-as-usual-believe-in-bigfoot-ok-boomer.html]
having experienced qualitative differences between the work habits and
expectations of different generations. The silent generation, baby
boomers, Gen Xers, millennials, *Gen Z*: I have worked with members of
each of those generational groupings.

My parents are of the silent generation. I’ve worked with many of that
cohort, too. Salt of the earth. Hard workers. Bootstrappers. You don’t
have to ask them, they’ll tell you. (“Silent” is a misnomer.) As
coworkers, they’re reliably present.

Not so long ago that electric light was considered a luxury. And,
without going any further, it was also the case with mobile phones.
However, luxury criteria often change with technological progress and
cultural changes.

With the start of the new decade, Lexus shares the main findings of his
most recent study on the future of luxury; more specifically, what will
be the indispensable requirements of luxury within 10 years?

University: "The literature though sporadic, has garnered increasing
interest from both academicians as well as management practitioners.
Using co-word analysis, a qualitative research method, nineteen
peer-reviewed articles published during the years 2000 and 2019 were
analyzed. This analysis extracts five major themes: *Generation Z*
characteristics, Workforce expectations, prevenient generation
characteristics, Inter-generational dynamics, and Workplace transformation."

2020 FEB 15 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at
Journal of Transportation -- New research on the travel sector has found
that 56% of UK airline passengers report that they spend more time than
they want to using digital channels to plan and book flights. Similarly,
47% of UK hotel guests report that they spend too much time planning and
booking a hotel stay. Of the UK travellers surveyed, 70% reported that
they would like to receive personalized offers from travel sellers and
75% report they are comfortable sharing personal data if it will help
them save money or have better journeys. However, despite this, just 18%
say they receive offers that reflect their interests, travel behaviours
or stage in their lives. This is despite the travel sector being one of
the pioneering e-commerce sectors and one of the largest digital
commerce sectors globally.

Nepal, Feb. 7 -- Deciding to watch a series requires a serious
investment of time. You have to wait for episodes to show up on Netlfix
or the television, and if the show becomes popular, producers make sure
it never ends.

When you invest in a series, you either end up binging on the entire
show (thus, saying goodbye to sleep) or having to wait an entire week to
finally know what's going to happen (and let me tell you that patience
is not one of my strong points). And so, I try to steer away from series
as much as possible.

shoes, accessories, fragrances, hair products, beauty and skincare. The
survey also asked about social media platforms as a tool for product
discovery.
