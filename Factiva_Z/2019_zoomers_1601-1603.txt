Mumbai: Frapp the student-friendly mobile app is fast changing the
landscape of experience and earning for students in campus. This app
empowers students to find internships or earn money through online or
campus work.

The app provides an alternative to traditional internships that not only
provides financial freedom but in a way provides an avenue for students
to understand financial prudence giving them an early start to making
money. While internships on Frapp provide students the requisite
experience that they clamour for to be industry ready, not all students
have an internship bent of mind and would often want to explore
opportunities that are easier and fun. Additionally, sometimes
internships are unpaid roles that wouldn’t interest many students.
Keeping this mind, Frapp app developed a unique proposition called
“Missions”
