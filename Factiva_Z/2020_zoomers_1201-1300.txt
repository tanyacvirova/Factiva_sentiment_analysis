You might recognise Max and Harvey from X Factor: Celebrity. But to a
younger generation of viewers, the identical twins are more than that -
presenters, singers and role models. Alex Green speaks to the brothers
as they prepare to embark on their largest UK music tour yet.

IT IS quite the burden to be named the “next Ant and Dec” by Simon
Cowell aged just 17.

intellectual currents that the party and its elites have nurtured.

Bernie Sanders's victory in New Hampshire on top of his tie in Iowa
makes him a favorite for the Democratic presidential nomination. Hard to
believe, but in a winnable race against President Trump the opposition
may nominate a socialist who wants the government to control energy
production and health care, who wants nationwide rent control, and who
calls America a "racist society from top to bottom." No wonder Democrats
like James Carville are in agony.

The Vermont revolutionary's victory portends a long primary battle,
unless Democratic voters elevate a single mainstream candidate who can
challenge him. Mr. Sanders will get his 25% to 30% primary after
primary, racking up delegates on his way to the convention. If other
candidates keep dividing the other votes, he will be hard to stop, as
Mr. Trump was for Republicans in 2016. Even if a single alternative
emerges, Mr. Sanders won't go down without a ferocious intra-party fight.

Ahead of his show tonight at London Fashion Week, Bairbre Power meets
Richard Quinn, the designer who made headlines when Queen Elizabeth sat
on his front row. He talks about the influence of his Irish parents,
childhood memories of Donegal and what it's like dressing some of the
world's most high-profile women Designer Richard Quinn turned the big
3-0 last month and the London-Irish designer received a very special
present when he awoke to the news that global superstar Jennifer Lopez
had stepped out in one of his gowns at the Palm Springs International
Film Festival. It was the latest plot twist in the story of his
phenomenal rise to the top.

Not bad "for an archway in Peckham", says Quinn, referring to his south
London studio with a healthy dose of self-depreciation.

The number of people with a digital-only bank account is expected to
double in five years. About 23.2 million customers are expected to be
relying on app-based or online banks by 2025, according to Finder.com, a
personal finance comparison website, with most saying that they chose
them for convenience. There has been a 165 per cent increase in the
number of people banking with Starling, Monzo and the like in the past
year, although many don't rely on them as their only bank. Those born
after 1996 — *Generation Z* — use them the most.

The views of those born in the mid-to-late 1990s mean climate change and
trends like personalisation are front of mind for UK bosses, a report by

Of the nearly eight billion humans on Earth, what are the chances of two
people finding each other and deciding in the present to share their
past and intertwine their futures? Mathematically, the probability
factor of such a thing happening is lower than that of a 450-pound royal
Bengal tiger apparating out of thin air in the middle of your sitting
room on a Tuesday afternoon, mewing for milk. It is extraordinary,
magical, wondrous... and yet it happens all the time. Not the tiger
(that never happens), but love.

Venture down the digital rabbit hole with the Japanese art collective's
SuperNature exhibition in Macao

As art has gradually become synonymous with the worlds of entertainment,
technology, design and science, one of the world's leading "multiverse"
practitioners, Tokyo's art collective teamLab, debuts SuperNature at The
Venetian Macao. In terms of interaction with art, the stakes are raised
even higher by becoming more immersive across the Cotai Expo Hall's
enormous 54,000-square-foot space.

Seems like it was only yesterday that talk centred on millennials. But
wait for it, here comes the *Gen Z* or zillenials, if that’s your
preferred term. Millennials refers to the generation born between 1980
and 2000. *Gen Z* would be those born after. A recent survey by Tata
Capital put forth questions that help in “identifying the exact tipping
point i.e. 25 years of age when there is a behavioral shift in the
attitude of the two age groups.” The study, titled Millennial Pivot,
says millennials opt to go for holidays during festivals while their
younger counterparts actually offered a counter-balance to their
materialistic sensibilities. When it comes to festival vacations, 28% of
*Generation Z* would opt for religious activities compared to just 23%
for millennials. The study also reveals that 47% millennials are more
likely to purchase gifts for themselves compared to 42% *Gen Z* during
festive seasons.

Discounts are an effective way to attract first-time e-wallet customers,
but as more people and businesses adopt cashless payments, they have
become a secondary motivation; many users will use electronic payments
even without cash back or discounts, a recent survey shows.

The survey, conducted by market research firm Ipsos Indonesia showed
that 71 percent of first-time e-wallet users were motivated by
promotions, especially for online taxis and food delivery services.

Postponed payment schemes are making an impact in the worlds of fashion
and beauty. What could grocery retailers gain - or lose - from getting
involved?

Delayed gratification is so last century. Want that new outfit you saw
on Instagram, but payday is weeks away? Want the latest gadget, but
saving up is a chore? Forget the waiting. You can bypass the tedious
stage and have it right here, right now - and it won't cost you a penny
more.

For artist Stanislava Pinchuk sewing is subversive.

Seventeen years ago - on March 18, 2003 - David Burgess and Will
Saunders climbed the sails of the Sydney Opera House and painted in
looming red letters the words NO WAR. The pair were sentenced to nine
months' weekend jail and divided the nation between those appalled at
the iconoclasm and those who believed the message made the gesture worthy.

One of the weird things about being a mother is witnessing the casual
sexism of the schoolyard - and how it can somehow become a marker of
your own uncoolness when you snort at it.

First there were the "your mum" or "yo mama" jokes which are still a
mark of social currency in our neighbourhood. Like: "Your mum's so
stupid she puts lipstick on her forehead to make up her mind. Your mum's
so stupid, she stared at a carton of apple juice for 12 hours because it
said concentrate."

Love is in the air and Nigerian bank users have spoken. ‘Who is the love
of your life? Who is your crush? Your side boo? Your worst ex? Who will
you break up with?’ Here at Ciuci Consulting, our annual banking report
– What Retail Banking Customers Want for 2020 has started on a ‘love
note’ with the #BankLoveChallenge.

This challenge was conducted to discover the love-hate relationship
between Nigerians and their banks. The favourite banks of respondents
across all age groups were listed with the reasons why they melt their
hearts and fill their tummies with butterflies. The survey conducted by
Ciuci Consulting in partnership with The Guardian used a random sample
of 1,023 respondents across Nigeria. The results showed that the top 5
most loved banks are GTBank, Zenith Bank, Access bank, First Bank and UBA.

Automation in the workplace will have many forms. The rise of AI could
usher in new businesses processes that need little human input. In a
world of automation, will businesses be able to integrate these systems
with their workforces?

The first
part[https://www.silicon.co.uk/e-management/jobs/automation-part-1-the-robots-are-coming-331521]
of this series covered the expanding use of automation across the
business landscape. We took a broad overview of the current state of
these technologies. This second part looks at the practical implications
of automation and, how a business needs to be ready to take advantage of
these systems.

UK based vegan and gluten-free punch maker Punchy Drinks has moved to
using fully recyclable, plastic-free cans that feature paper labels. The
company previously used glass bottles with plastic labelling but made
the decision to change packaging in order to meet environmental credentials.

Punchy founder Paddy Cavanagh-Butler told Packaging Gateway: We started
off with a glass bottle and made the move to cans to meet environmental
credentials as glass isnt infinitely recyclable in the same way can is.
We also moved from plastic to paper labels which means that the can is
fully recyclable and can be put in the bin straight away, unlike most
glass bottles.

(GlobeNewswire) - According to the latest whitepaper from global talent
acquisition and management firm, Alexander Mann Solutions, being less
rigid with academic requirements, can drastically increase employers
visibility among emerging STEM talent.

As discussed in Early careers recruitment: What are the opportunities
from digitalization, STEM and Diversity & Inclusion? STEM businesses are
experiencing difficulties in hiring talent, with recruitment processes
taking on average 31 more days than expected. By offering visa
sponsorships, or being more flexible towards academic requirements,
businesses can tap into a wider pool of talent and help plug skills gaps
in the sector.

A new study suggests certain products would boost spending by young
consumers if they were placed in vending machines and other unattended
channels.

“The Future of Unattended Retail” study from Pymnts and USA Technologies
finds that millennial and *Gen Z* consumers are especially likely to
shop unattended channels, such as vending machines and kiosks, if
retailers are using them to sell non-traditional items.

2011 ET - South Korea's central bank may cut interest rates to help
cushion the economy from the coronavirus outbreak's "rising economic
toll," Capital Economics says. The research group has cut its 2020 GDP
growth forecast for Korea to 1.5% from 2.5% given its close integration
into Chinese supply chains. It expects the Bank of Korea to lower its
base rate to a new all-time low of 1.0% at its Feb. 27 meeting. Over the
past few weeks, central banks in China, Malaysia, Thailand and the
Philippines have cut interest rates. (kwanwoo.jun@wsj.com)

0348 GMT - Alibaba's revenue from China retail and local services is
likely to decline in the fiscal 4Q as a result of the coronavirus
outbreak, Bocom International says. As the epidemic disrupts product
supply and logistics operations, Alibaba's total sales in the quarter
ending March may only grow by 20%, compared with a previous estimate of
31% increase, Bocom says. However, the brokerage raises its target price
slightly to US$269 from US$268 with an unchanged buy call, after the
e-commerce firm's latest earnings beat expectations. Once the outbreak
eases, Alibaba's sales should recover strongly on pent-up demand, and
new initiatives such as online healthcare may also grow faster, Bocom
says. (yifan.wang@wsj.com)

DTC selling has taken the reins in the apparel and footwear industries,
upending the entire business in the process.

Anyone who has a social media account is surely familiar with DTC
sellers—they’ve become inescapable by this point—but one can be forgiven
for being a bit perplexed about where they came from, how they operate,
and what makes them so different from more traditional types of selling.

2050 ET - Citi recommends selling EUR/JPY to reflect bias for ongoing
EUR underperformance near term. The U.S. bank notes factors such as
downward revisions to Chinese and global growth due to the coronavirus
outbreak are causing recent EUR weakness. Also, EUR is likely being used
as a funding currency given declining volatility in rates markets. The
ECB could also be in "perma ease" mode as Europe's stagnation continues,
whereas the BOJ may lag behind in any dovish policy shifts this year.
Two-year swap rate differentials between Europe and Japan suggest
EUR/JPY dropping toward 115, Citi says. EUR/JPY little changed at
119.01. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)

The German challenger bank N26 says that Brexit has forced it to close
all its UK customers’ accounts. They have until April 15 to move their
money into an alternative bank account.

The bank says that the timing and framework outlined in the European
Union Withdrawal Agreement mean that it won’t be able to operate in the
UK with its European banking licence.

As the video platform celebrates its 15th birthday, a new breed of
older, wiser social-media stars are finding their voice

Seven years ago, Margaret Manning recorded herself delivering an
impassioned message into the camera of her laptop. She explained that
she’d started a community called Sixty and Me, for women hitting or
surpassing that milestone, so that together, they could ‘reinvent’ their
lives. ‘I want to inspire you and motivate you to take action,’ she
urged, vowing to help her viewers feel more independent, healthy and
financially secure.

According to the survey, around 50% of the respondents opt for a cup of
coffee as the first meal of the day. (Source: Thinkstock/Getty Images)

We belong to a caffeinated population, where a cup of coffee is the
go-to beverage. Especially among the Indian millennials, this morning
beverage provides the right energy that helps to make conversations
throughout the day as well as helps them stay focused at work. But to
understand this better, Lavazza, the Italian brand did a survey ‘Brewing
Conversations’, to gather insights on whether coffee is a ‘companion’ or
a ‘motivator’ for Indian millennials and *Gen-Z* population. Over 3000
young people from across all major Indian cities responded to this survey.

But this was not the apartment of a *Generation Z* procrastinator in

It was the second most downloaded app of 2019 but in 2020 has acquired
its first ‘why I deleted my TikTok’ essay

Perhaps you’ve just barely wrapped your head around the existence and
popularity of TikTok – something about dances? A young woman called
Charli D’Amelio[https://www.tiktok.com/@charlidamelio?lang=en] ? Does
the word “ renegade[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FukgMwwdwPM] ” have
something to do with it? Sigh.

It’s a holiday that means different things to different people. Some
pass the day without a thought. Some spend it sharing a tasty meal and
libations with a significant other or a few close friends. Others might
find themselves face-down in a pint of Ben and Jerry’s, wondering where
it all went wrong. That’s right ladies and gents, it’s Valentine’s Day.

Depending on one’s relationship status, the day might seem
insignificant, but from an economic standpoint, it is anything but.
Valentine’s Day is a major day for consumer spending, with big profits
for retail, restaurants, and florists.

I recently professed having experienced qualitative differences between
the work habits and expectations of different generations. The silent
generation, baby boomers, Gen Xers, millennials, *Gen Z*: I have worked
with members of each of those generational groupings.

My parents are of the silent generation. I’ve worked with many of that
cohort, too. Salt of the earth. Hard workers. Bootstrappers. You don’t
have to ask them, they’ll tell you. (“Silent” is a misnomer.) As
coworkers, they’re reliably present.

Marcela DobalConvenience and control are two of the "great wishes" that
will guide consumers, as reflected in the 10 consumer trends identified
by this year's consultancy Euromonitor International.In its annual
report, entitled « Top 10 Global Consumer Trends 2020 », to which The
Entrepreneur accessed, it details in 80 pages these axes and for each
compiles cases of companies that carry out good practices in different
countries.Cases range from a Singaporean who created a fleet of shared
electric cars, to a multinational that paints murals that lower
pollution in Mexico, to a Danish woman who created devices to prevent
smart speakers from listening private talks."Brands must strike the
right balance between building trust, providing security, and delivering
products and services that give more weight to consumer concerns this
year," the report says.

BEABADOOBEE Philippines-born, Camden-raised Beatrice Kristi Laus (inset,
right) is a dyed-in-the-wool, 1990s geek girl, from her striped-sleeve
sweatshirt to her fuzz-heavy, grunge and slacker-songs - even though, at
19, she missed it all by some years. Naming her discovery of Kimya
Dawson as a lightbulb moment, Bea has kept that tradition, with *Gen Z*
fans worldwide, gazillions of YouTube hits and a Brits Rising Star nod.
Tomorrow, Motorpoint Arena, Nottingham and touring (supporting The
1975), beabadoobee.co.uk

CAMILA CABELLO The Cuban-American evacuee from girl group Fifth Harmony
blew in like a southerly buster with her slinky (and in fact nuanced)
2018 debut solo album, which ranged over matters romantic, from lovesick
upset to booty calls, but with her follow-up she seemed to be taking
tips from Taylor Swift, adding 1990s pop pizzazz to her tropical
pop/salsa mix. Expect the full menu on her Romance tour. Jun 1, Resorts

The new film of Jane Austen's novel has given its heroine impeccable
style - and sparked anew trend, says Bethan Holt lt

'Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever and rich." Little, perhaps, did Jane
Austen know that those words would commit her heroine to Regency style
icon status, an accolade firmly intact 200 years later and explored anew
in a revamped silverscreen adaptation.

The next decade will see further demand for overseas assignments

As the world enters a new decade, old ideas about work and talent
mobility are waning. Employees aren't sitting behind desks all day, nor
are they restricted by the ways in which they can communicate with
coworkers. These advancements—and more—hint at how the next 10 years
will usher in the future of work.

Since time immemorial, Valentine's Day has been synonymous with red
roses, cute soft toys and lots of sinful indulgence. But the times,
they're a changin'. From traditional favourites like gooey chocolate
cakes and sugar-laden cookies to new-age delicacies like gluten-free,
dairy-free and sugar-free desserts, V-Day treats have undergone a swish
makeover, thanks to *Gen-Z* and millennials' growing fixation with all
things healthy.

Sneha Singhi, the owner and head chef at a city-based chain of
patisseries, said that the demand for healthier desserts is on the rise
in Kolkata. "While our overall sales have gone up by 30% this
Valentine's Week, more and more customers are now looking for vegan and
gluten-free cakes. Our heart-shaped gluten-free chocolates are among the
best sellers at our cafe," she said.

0528 GMT - China's central bank may cut benchmark deposit rates in order
to guide down lending rates at banks to help virus-hit businesses, ANZ
says. Its optimistic estimate is that Chinese banks may suffer CNY400
billion in potential losses as many small companies are struggling with
a sharp cooling of economic activity and plummeting consumer spending.
But ANZ thinks the losses are manageable for China's banking sector when
compared against total bad loans of CNY2.4 trillion and an annual
write-off of CNY1.1 trillion. (grace.zhu@wsj.com)

2141 ET - Singapore's January non-oil domestic exports likely declined
3.5% on year, according to the median estimate from a WSJ poll of eight
economists. Exports rose 2.4% in December. "Electronics exports may
underperform again, but non-electronics exports may provide some
buffer," says Selena Ling, head of Treasury Research & Strategy at OCBC;
"The full brunt of the post-Chinese New Year shutdown impact on
factories and supply chains may be clearer in the February readings."
Measured on-month, Singapore's non-oil domestic exports likely dropped
4.15% in January, according to the median estimate from the poll. The
data are due at 0030 GMT Monday. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)

*HD* 	Calling an RBA Rate Cut in April Looks Difficult -- Market Talk

1932 ET - If the RBA sticks with its cautious approach to interest
rates, weighing risk on both sides of the equation, then an April cut
looks difficult, says ANZ. Most economists are betting April, but market
pricing is for September. April's policy meeting comes before the next
inflation print and after only two more employment reports, one of which
is due in the coming week. While ANZ expects employment growth to be
softer over January/February and the unemployment rate to tick up, this
may not be sufficient to meet the RBA's criteria for a cut by April. ANZ
says its forecast is under review, awaiting the employment data.

On-demand hiring is going mainstream, with younger workers driving the trend

Legislation in California is threatening the future of the “gig economy”
for low-paid work such as driving with Uber or couriering hot meals. Yet
flexible hours, on-demand work and other key tenets of the gig economy
are now shaking up careers in white-collar work.

Hirers take note: workers of the future are instinctively inclusive,
worried about climate change — and want to solve problems

As a child Adam Davidson was raised to believe that any work to do with
business should be avoided. In his new book, The Passion Economy, the
journalist and podcaster offers an optimistic vision of people making
money while working at things they enjoy — their passions. He describes
his 1970s upbringing in a subsidised artists’ housing project in New
York’s Greenwich Village, where “money was the opposite of art, the
opposite of passion”.

(PRWeb) - At a time of critical change and disruption in the field of
education, the Eisenhower Fellowships Global Poll on the State of
Education around the world found that an overwhelming majority of young
adults regard the quality of education and access to education in their
nations as two of their most important issues.

Nonetheless, only 14 percent of the millennials and post-millennial
members of *Generation Z* surveyed in 20 countries across six continents
rated the educational systems in their nation as excellent, and more
than half rated it poor or only fair.

Its a well-established truth that every organization today must be a
digital organization. It is just that fact that savvy retailers have
known and addressed for at least the last five years.

Due to technologys consumerization, and the ubiquity of the connected
mobile device, customers now expect a fully personalized, digital
experience when they shop online and in-store and they expect a seamless
congruence between their online and physical experiences.

1654 ET - Companies that rely on China-based manufacturing expect even
when factories open, it will be difficult to get space on trucks due to
coronavirus, says Tim Enwall, head of Misty Robotics, a venture-backed
startup. "Everyone will be rushing to get backlog shipped and many of
the truck drivers are stuck in their home provinces," Enwall said. "Our
freight partner has warned all about that bottleneck possibility,"
Enwall says. He says Misty had built up inventory before Lunar New Year
so isn't itself feeling affected yet. He adds the factory Misty uses,
which is based in Guangdong province, just restarted.

They say age is just a number but nearly half of Baby Boomers think it
is the biggest barrier to opportunity in 2020.

Nationally, a quarter of Australians view age as the biggest opportunity
hurdle, followed by financial status (24 per cent) and a difficult jobs
market (21 per cent), according to LinkedIn's second annual Opportunity
Index, released yesterday.

This is a cautionary column. The staff at the Bureau of Labor Statistics
have an impossible task. They claim the “Employment Cost Index or ECI
measures changes in the cost of employees to employers over time.”  But
increasingly the so-called gig economy opens to question the accuracy of
their statistics. 

To be fair, in the strictest understanding of the terms “employees” and
“employers,” the ECI sentence may be accurate. However, it’s not stated
in many BLS announcements that their surveys rely heavily on
administrative data from state unemployment insurance programs. Two core
points flow from that linkage:

There’s the audacity of hope, and then there’s the hard data proving
that most new food and beverage brands are quickly consigned to the
dustbin of history. But some do manage to ride that magical CPG skate
curve. So what are they doing differently?

It’s a question Dr James F. Richardson, cultural anthropologist turned
business strategist, has been pondering throughout his career advising
food & beverage brands, and serves as the focus of his new book: Ramping
your brand: How to ride the killer CPG growth curve.

The new film of Jane Austen's 'Emma' has given its heroine impeccable
style-and could spark a new trend

'Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever and rich’. Little, perhaps, did Jane
Austen know that those words would commit her heroine to Regency style
icon status, an accolade firmly intact two hundred years later and
explored anew in a revamped silver screen adaptation.
