JAKARTA, Indonesia, March 13, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- A significant gap
exists between the way leaders and employees view progress toward
equality in their organizations, according to new research from
Accenture. Closing the gap will yield substantial benefits for companies
and their employees.

The report, "Getting to Equal 2020: The Hidden Value of Culture
Makers[https://www.accenture.com/us-en/about/inclusion-diversity/gender-equality?c=acn_glb_iwdn%2Fa_10904973&n=otc_0319]",
which includes research across 28 countries including Indonesia, found
that organizations are at an inflection point: Today's Indonesia
workforce cares increasingly about workplace culture and believes it is
critical to helping them thrive in the workplace (reported 88% of women
and 86% men), and a majority of leaders (86%) believe an inclusive
workplace culture is vital to the success of their business.

Simon Chan, a vice-president with the Kitchener innovation hub
Communitech, told a Windsor audience Thursday the ability of companies
to anticipate technological trends and meet the needs of the workforce
are going to be the keys to determining survival in the modern economy.

"The traditional models for business and career pathways is outdated,"
said Chan, who oversees talent, academy and future work for Communitech
and the 1,500 businesses it supports.

On Monday night I had supper with my mother and my mother-in-law, both
of whom are in their seventies and have "underlying health conditions".
It wasn't a special occasion, just a chicken pie and a catch-up at the
kitchen table. But as we said goodbye, with joshing elbow bumps instead
of hugs, I felt the same anxious foreboding that I imagine parents feel
when they wave their teenagers off on gap-year adventures in dangerous
places.

Have they got everything they need? Will they remember to wash their
hands? How long will it be before I see them again? Some people seem to
find it reassuring that Covid-19 "only" kills old people. I find it
terrifying. It's one thing - and quite bad enough - to lose your elderly
relatives in the normal way, picked off one by one as ageing takes its
course. This is the grief that everyone has to endure, although its
ordinariness doesn't make it any less of an ordeal.

While the festival of Holi is over, India's *Gen Z* is still tripping on
this health drink, which has often been hailed as the holy grail of good
health

All the rage on Instagram these days is kaanji, that good ol' drink made
of fermented carrots, seasoned with mustard and black salt. Though it
has been around for ages, it's being hailed as the 'new' miracle drink
by health freaks who are rediscovering its gutfriendly properties.
Social media ghouls meanwhile, are loving it for its dark pink, almost
winelike colour, that's so filter friendly. Entrepreneurs are in on the
trend too, with many bottling, labelling and selling it. Kaanji, served
usually around Holi time, is like a desi sangria that will reward you
with a clean gut, instead of a head-thumping hangover. With no sugar or
alcohol content, kaanji is safe for everyone from diabetics to children.
Experts tell us why kaanji is all that it's cracked up to be.

Regardless of how many Jane Austen adaptations you've seen, you probably

THE POSTERS WERE the first to tip off fashion observers. Emma (played by
rising starlet Anya Taylor-Joy) wears a high-neck top in pastel pink
with statement sleeves and a hand muffler. One poised foot sticks out en
pointe from under her billowy white skirt, a gesture of confidence and
authority.

TikTok has become a hotbed of political debate, social issue advocacy
and policy arguments - and most recently, a battleground for the
abortion debate in the US

Despite being 25, I feel like an ancient crone every time I open TikTok,
the Chinese-owned video-sharing app that launched in 2018. TikTok has
become synonymous with *Gen Z*: 13 is its official age requirement but
in reality many users are as young as eight or nine. On the app, kids
are able to post videos of dances, lip syncs, memes and sketches, in
clips of up to 60 seconds, to a potential audience of hundreds of
millions if your settings are public. Parents assume that TikTok is
where teens go to have light fun, to make jokes or silly videos with
their friends. But in recent times it has become a hotbed of political
debate, social issue advocacy and policy arguments - and most recently,
a battleground for the abortion debate in the United States.

As coronavirus concerns spark a toilet paper-buying frenzy across the
USA, some people are reconsidering a new restroom appliance: The bidet.

Anticipating a potential quarantine, shoppers ran out this weekend to
buy food, water and other staples so they could avoid exposing
themselves and their families. Others, alarmed by the rising death count
and number of confirmed cases in the USA, went on impulsive buying
binges, stripping store shelves of toilet paper and cleaning supplies.

If you ever wondered why you don’t see this colleague or that friend on
your Instagram feed, it might be because almost every other post is an
ad. At least it seems that way. Twitter is also loaded with promoted
posts, and your Facebook feed is filled with notices that tout so-and-so
liked something or other (their soft advertising entrée). Whether users
like them or not, those ads are having meaningful results for brands.

Marketers spent more than $89 billion on social media ads in 2019, a
figure that’s expected to increase 8.7 percent to reach $102 billion
this year, according to Sprout Social, a social media management and
optimization platform. The bulk of that, about $74 billion, is expected
to be generated via mobile advertising, while the remaining $27 billion
is projected to come from desktop ads, according to Statista.

1 THE7STARS Media agency, London UK employees 223 43%M 57%F Unlimited
holiday allowance, an equal profit-share bonus, no job titles or time
sheets, a "wellness room" and an office-dog rota are all part of the
winning formula that have earned the7stars the top spot for Campaign's
Best Place to Work for large companies in 2020.

After playing second fiddle in 2018 and 2019, in the past 12 months the
media agency has introduced several initiatives that have boosted the
firm's offerings to employees. It has created a "wellness room" - a
permanent relaxing space with a sofa, blackout blinds, an aromatherapy
diffuser and an iPad with mindful apps downloaded. The idea is for staff
to go there for time with no distractions, to recharge and relax.

Herald CorrespondentLeaders are the original “influencers” but can only
remain so if they adapt to the complex world of work in 2020.

This was partly because leadership was easy to describe but hard to do,
Nelson Mandela University’s Prof Paul Poisat said at an SA Institute of
Chartered Accountants’ business breakfast at the FNB building in Newton
Park yesterday.

While the 2020 SXSW Film Festival has been canceled due to the
coronavirus, IndieWire is covering select titles from this year’s edition. 

It’s a shame that Cooper Raiff’s “Shithouse” didn’t get a chance to
screen at this year’s SXSW, because . And that’s all the more true
because it sounds like such a potential nightmare on paper: Written,
directed, and co-edited by its reluctant 22-year-old star with some help
from his friends, Raiff’s vulnerable DIY gem tells a coming-of-age story
about a mopey college freshman who’s struggling with the whiplash of
leaving home.

In the winter of 2002, while our parents hummed that agonizing litany of
monetary conversion - six euros is 1000 pesetas, 6 euros is 1000
pesetas-, the millennial teenagers, still free of the generational label
that would sentence us to the childish precariousness, we dreamed of a
future in which everything was possible through the first edition of
Operation Triumph, that talent that turned construction workers into
stars. Although we presumed to have a very refined musical criterion, we
endured the musical refried of each gala without too much squeals, and
that is that the music was the least: what we wanted, now that in our
pockets they tinkled European coins, was to delight us with the miracle
of social ascent, because the success of those 16 boys had to predict ours.

In just a few years, Mike Dullea has transformed AutoAlert from a
financial decision-making tool for automotive dealerships into a
full-blown customer experience platform.

AutoAlert, which provides software solutions tailored for automotive
dealerships, has about 400 employees nationwide. But since AutoAlert
moved its headquarters from Irvine, Calif., to Kansas City in
2017[https://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2017/02/16/autoalert-hq-former-kansas-city-southern-building.html],
the company's presence here has multiplied from 100 employees to 350. It
currently occupies six of eight floors in a downtown office tower.

New insight shows that pub visits by men declined by 0.8% in 2019, but
there was a 1.6% increase in female customers, who now account for 48.7%
of all pub customers.

The data, sourced by The NPD Group, looked at the sales and visit
patterns at British pubs, and concluded male visits were down and it was
only female visits driving growth.

(Bloomberg Opinion) -- After 12 long years of hibernation, the bear is
back in the U.S. — and this time its run will depend less on sentiment
and more on fundamentals.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed Wednesday down 20.3% from its
record high on Feb. 12, crossing the 20% threshold widely considered the
marker of a bear market. The S&P 500 Index dipped into bear territory,
too, falling to 2,707 late in the trading day from its record of 3,386
on Feb. 19.

“Visible mending” has been taken up by those who want to protest fast
fashion and disposable culture. It’s also thrifty.

Only a few generations ago, socks were routinely darned, sweaters mended
and pants patched. You could buy a sewing kit at any drugstore. Knowing
how to use it was a mark of good housekeeping.

Early this year, the short video app TikTok joined Nairobi Garage, a
leading coworking space in Nairobi’s Kilimani district.

The Chinese company behind the world’s fastest-growing social media app
had already been holding “creator sessions” and meetups around the city
in 2019, urging creative young Kenyans to learn about the benefits of
joining the “fun, cool short video platform”. Last October it partnered
with Chinese phone maker Transsion’s Infinix brand in Kenya with a
hashtag campaign called #WeAreHot to boost a new phone model but also
raise awareness of the app.

"What do you get from the TikTok videos? Do you prefer the platform for
entertainment, passing time or for connecting with your friends? I have
seen comical videos, venting sessions and some that do not make any
sense what so ever and some are just rude, making fun of others." I
asked the 14-year-old k-popper teenager flipping through the pages of a
manga book while he chose to respond in English coming from a Spanish
speaking family and studying Mandarin as a third language.

The reply was not quite as I expected and it compelled me to look into
the reason 'why' rather than 'what'. To better understand the reasoning
I personally communicated with 23 teenagers who actively use this
platform coming from 15 countries and each seemed to add something
unique to their responses.

KUALA LUMPUR, March 12 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A rising number of
young men in Australia are falling victim to online "sextortion", the
head of the country's internet safety agency has warned, bucking a
global trend of primarily targeting vulnerable women and girls.

Seven out of 10 victims of sextortion - a form of extortion that
involves sexual acts or images as its currency - in Australia were men,
according to the office of Australia's eSafety commissioner, a
government agency.

Every school talks about workforce readiness. What they’re doing to
prepare students for the real world. The innovative tools and
technologies they’re using to prep the next generation for the ever
changing future-of-work landscape.

There is a lot of energy focused on the next tech skills students need
or the next tech tools we can use to enhance teaching and learning. But
are these tech tools and tech skills doing enough for students? When
students graduate high school, are they really prepared to take on life
(and career) challenges?

HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam, March 12, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- The Fram^ and
Gemme partnership is at the intersection of fast-growing digital
businesses and the increasing demand for sustainability and greater
social consciousness in emerging categories. Fram^ delivers leading
digital and technology services to support rapid company growth and
digital development. Gemme provides an intuitive consumer-to-consumer
clothing rental service.

The Gemme model doesn't require production of new fashion, which makes
everything that happens on the platform more sustainable. Other rental
services own their inventory and still put orders to fashion brands,
which drives production. Fram^ have supported Gemme to have new smart
ways of working sustainably and are now a driving force behind making
the 'end-of-ownership' and the 'sharing economy' a reality for people in
Stockholm.

India, March 12 -- Are you a Bollywood enthusiast who is constantly
choreographing your own rendition of 'Suraj Hua Madham' alone in your
room? If you answered that question with a yes, then this TikTok trend
is bound to tug at your filmy heartstrings.

The 'Trash or Trend' TikTok fad offers people a chance to channel their
inner music critic and tell the world their opinion, popular or not, on
popular hits. The content creators usually split their screen into two
with one section titled something positive such as, 'banger', 'iconic',
'yay', or even 'bhalo'. Understandably the other side of the screen is
headlined something like, 'trash', 'nay', 'na', or even 'skip' to
categorise those undesirable tunes. People then either rally up their
friends or take on the TikTok stage solo to convey their emotions about
famous songs.

Rosebud? It's the last word uttered by newspaper tycoon Charles Foster
Kane in Orson Welles's iconic film Citizen Kane.

Okay, Boomer, it's actually the most common cheat code in The Sims. Type
it in during cheat mode and it gets you 1,000 Simoleons. Do it enough
times and Rosebud becomes meaningless but your Sim is filthy rich and
for no effort.

*Generation Z* in Thailand are more entrepreneurial, more concerned with
financial success and more open to diverse viewpoints than their
counterparts in Western countries, says a study by Stamina Asia, a
Bangkok-based research company.

The results of the "Meet the Zers" study found Thai *Generation Z* share
most of the features with their contemporaries in the West: they also
want to challenge the status quo in terms of values, environment,
technology and relationship with brands.

AS PART of its 50th anniversary celebration, PBS has launched a
multimedia storytelling project focused on faith and religion in the
United States.

Using photo, video, and text message submissions, "American Portrait"
aims to highlight the nation's religious diversity-as well as its
commonality. Participants will respond to prompts about what they were
raised to believe, the religious traditions they maintain, and how they
make sense of the world today.

It’s not quite a Tesla, for sure, but bowling down the street in a Low
Speed Electric Vehicle (LSEV) will definitely turn a few heads.
Lightweight, and limited to speeds of around 40 km/h, the technology
underneath their quirky design has come a long way since the bubble cars
of the 80s.

Already pretty popular in China, where these miniature electric vehicles
offer an alternative to motorcycles, bicycles and e-bikes, policymakers
predict that they could disrupt the country’s demand for fossil fuels
thanks to a surprising market. Snapping up these mini electric vehicles
in their millions are those who haven’t ever owned a four-wheeled
vehicle before. They are extremely cheap to buy, easy to park and
perfect for urban centres where space is at a premium. Their low speed
and lightweight construction mean that you don’t need a license to drive
one adding to their appeal for those who might not have previously
considered buying a car of any sort.

Frustrated after a string of break-ups, Dwita Astari Pujiartati quit the
casual romance circuit and turned to a growing trend among Indonesian
singles - marriage without dating.

The 27-year-old professor exchanged resumes with prospective suitors -
helped by a Muslim cleric-cum-matchmaker - until she was contacted by a
long-lost acquaintance who also wanted to give contact-less dating a whirl.

Miami, FL, March 11, 2020 --(PR.com)-- Amid a coronavirus outbreak in
the United States and across the world, Covid-19 does appear to affect
seniors worse than younger generations as a whole. Preliminary data
suggest people who are in there 60's and older might be more susceptible
to Covid-19. There is no question that our bodies do change over time.
All the more reason to take very good care of ourselves as we age.

However, senior citizens having to fight off or fortify their bodies
from contracting Covid-19 isn't the only thing they are having to worry
about. As each day goes by and more senior lives are claimed by the
Covid-19 virus, as the media reports, younger generations have begun to
discriminate, demean and persecute our mature population, confusing age
with doom.

BOSTON — Four years ago, Bernie Sanders won big among white blue-collar
voters in the Democratic presidential primary, helping fuel his
neck-and-neck run against Hillary Clinton that nearly reached the
Democratic national convention.

It also exposed a major vulnerability for Clinton that proved damaging
for her in the general election against Donald Trump.

Eighty-three per cent of recent non-Russell-Group graduates feel that
they wouldn’t have been able to secure their first graduate role without
an internship, compared to just 14% of their Russell Group contemporaries

In an awards season marked by Hollywood heavyweights, from J.Lo to Renée
Zellweger, a surprising number of best dressed looks came courtesy of a
new crop of stars — and their A-list stylists. These rising "It" girls
are calling on the town's tastemakers to help them cultivate their looks
— and land lucrative fashion and beauty endorsement deals. "Designers
have broadened their approach to dressing talent; it's no longer about
the establishment only," says Karla Welch, who commissioned custom Ralph
& Russo for Knives Out actress Ana de Armas, 31, to wear at the Golden
Globes.

Wine consumption growth in the US - New Zealand's largest market for
wine exports by value - is slowing and bold moves will be required to
respond to a changing market structure and an emerging consumer with
different values, according to Rabobank's latest global Wine Quarterly.

The quarterly says the US wine industry has become accustomed to annual
wine consumption growth rates of two per cent or more and the decline in
recent years to one per cent annual growth is cause for concern.

Retailers are facing a smarter, more mindful and often demanding
consumer today. Multiple reports and studies have found that not only do
consumers expect more from the brands they purchase from but will do
research and pay more for what they want.

One of the leading consumer behaviors revolves around an expectation for
companies to meet criteria that align with personal social values.
Sustainability is a leading theme for the way many consumers shop today,
with many consumers even looking to shop largely through resale and
vintage retailers.

One of podcasting’s youngest hosts is gaining notice for sounding older
than her years.

At 17, Sammy Jaye is the youngest person at audio entertainment giant
iHeartMedia to have a podcast , where she has interviewed Kesha, Meghan
Trainor and Julia Michaels, among others, hoping to get behind their
celebrity and ask them how they deal with some of the unique issues
facing *Gen Z* listeners. Her “Let’s Be Real with Sammy Jaye” debuted
last month on more than 100 IHeartRadio stations.

As a noticeable shift takes place in the world of intimates and fashion
marketing, emerging brands have transitioned to body-positive
over-sexualized imagery. And recently, some advertisements, from
fast-fashion brands, have been banned in the U.K for objectifying women.

Historically, representations of sexuality and what constitutes what is
traditionally sexy have done well in advertisements. Though Sara Beech,
strategist at Frontier Strategy, told WWD that consumer attitudes are
evolving to become more diverse, inclusive and authentic — wanting to
see the subject be empowered rather than an object of affection.

Sharing the passwords to streaming services is commonplace, but while
the etiquette of doing so is undefined, the terms of service are clear

The cheapest subscriptions to Netflix, Stan and Spotify are about $10 a
month. But people are paying much, much less than that. Many share the
services with partners or friends. Some share with friends of friends.
And others share with their housemate’s ex-partner’s family – who they
have never actually met.
