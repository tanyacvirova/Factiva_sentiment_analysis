THIS week, the No S**t Sherlock Award goes to Co Meath's Ratoath
College, which has found that iPads in schools are distracting. The
school commissioned a report on its no-books-iPads-only rule, and found
students used their devices for gaming, shopping and social media.

The school has elected to bring back schoolbooks, after a fraught
experiment with iPads which saw hundreds of parents signing a petition
to please, for the love of God, stop legitimising their children's
screen obsession.

The banking crash has made Ireland the world's worst stock market for
value seekers such as those who follow the creed of legendary investor
Warren Buffett according to a study of longterm investment returns
published by Credit Suisse.

"Ireland has been very poor for value investors because the Irish banks
were deemed value stocks and they suffered terribly in the global
financial crisis," said Paul Marsh of London Business School, who
compiled the study with his colleague Mike Staunton and with Elroy
Dimson of Cambridge University.

This coming week will be a busy one when it comes to recognizing the
anniversaries of three interesting, though totally distinct, events from
our city's past.

I'll start with the oldest of the three and the event that resulted in
the creation of our city 186 years ago.

Five years ago the restaurant industry was bustling with fine dine
establishments. Fast forward to 2020 and the restaurants that were
trailblazers during their tenure have made way for a new generation of
eateries. We are in the era of premium casual dining.

The millennial customer is a very decisive customer. They want variety,
quality, creativity and experience all within a certain price parameter
and time span.

“You’ve got to write an article about Uber Eats.” This was from my
sheepish son, who’d just been rolled for $22 on Uber Eats for a pie,
sausage roll and Sprite from a BP station precisely 750 metres away from
where he sat. The instore price is $8.40.

He works part time at Macca’s and his main point is that Uber Eats
charges aren’t transparent because customers pay a premium on the food
as well as a delivery fee of between $4.99 and $7.99. A $10.30 Big Mac
Combo instore, for example, is $12 on Uber Eats. My son’s pie was more
than double the instore price. This premium isn’t commonly known, my
straw poll suggested.

The Coachella music festival, not necessarily known for its adorable
moments, offered up the pop equivalent of two baby pandas playing when,
under the pink arena lights and to the accompaniment of the cheering and
frantic uploading of a thousand teenage witnesses, Billie Eilish met her
idol, Justin Bieber, for the first time last April.

it has never felt easier to shop. That's because the digital universe
has never known us so well. The [whatever thing] we love? It follows us
anywhere we're connected. It follows us on a train. It follows us on a
plane. It follows us here and there. It follows us everywhere. It's like
Dr. Seuss has assumed our collective shopping psyche. The products of
our dreams are on our phones, in our ears, flashing on our TV screens.
We're introduced to sleep masks that promise to fight the fearsome sun
and bring us rest, followed by weighted blankets that will cut therapy
bills in half. Products that know you want them before you do. And every
scroll floods us with personal endorsements: our friends' (both real and
the social media kind) bathtub selfies, their medicine cabinets and
vanities, staged and styled with lipsticks and perfumes and soaks that
are one click away. The mysteries of beauty routines are mysterious no
more. And it's all for sale, sale, sale!

Incoming! Within days of his reappointment as environment secretary,
George Eustice announced a daft (sadly not draft) policy. Phase out the
sale of house coal and wet wood in England.

Apparently, it's all about saving the environment and improving air
quality. Since this ban will affect rural areas (those in urban areas
have the 1956 Clean Air Act to fall back on) one has to question his
priorities.

It took 30 years, but it finally happened. AdAsia, the largest and most
prestigious advertising congress in Asia – organised every two years by
the Asian Federation of Advertising Associations (AFAA), returned to
Lahore and to the same venue where it took place in 1989 – the Alhamra
Arts Council on December 3, 4 and 5, 2019. Over the course of three
days, more than 30 speakers, many of whom were from overseas, voiced
their thoughts, ideas and viewpoints to an audience of over 710
advertising, marketing and media professionals.

What lies behind TikTok’s success?

With hostility between the US and China almost reaching the levels of a
new Cold War, there is a risk of what industry experts term as the rise
of the ‘splinternet’ – abandonment of a unified world wide web in favour
of silos of the internet controlled by national governments, and
adhering to their standards of acceptable content. Although this may
have broader implications on the freedom of information and speech, from
the perspectives of marketing and technology the more pressing issue is
that such a model will mean abandoning the universal standards of
development that led to such rapid adoption of the internet globally and
its ability to reach consumers around the world.

The latest miracle creams for 50-plus skin will work their magic -
whatever your age

When it comes to skincare, we're all very used to hearing about *Gen Z*
and what the youngsters are keen on. But as Marie Hélène Lair,
scientific communications director for Clarins, said recently: 'What
about Generation S, as in silver? The ladies of 60-plus - or as I prefer
to say, two times 30.' What indeed? Everyday ageism is probably what.

New seasons deserves a closet refresh—go into spring/summer
well-informed with the top looks to grab the maximum attention. This
spring speaks loudly about femininity with a myriad of options to offer
the urbane woman. So, if you're looking to keep your wardrobe
up-to-date, the latest trends can be your inspiration and choice.

This season, unconventional shapes meet craftsmanship as designers
flaunt attractive pattern-making skills. A series of artistic draping,
twisting, cut-outs, cinching and folding techniques are used to
emphasize silhouettes. Floral embroideries make a comeback. On the
surface front, wide explorations of washes are featured over denims
ranging from worn out effects to deeper indigo dips.

Mumbai, Feb. 29 -- Hospitality firms are looking to expand their
footprint in the country and in a struggling market, real-estate
builders are trying to go beyond residential and commercial projects.
And this has led both the parties to collaborate to change the
hospitality sector.

The Prestige Group in Bengaluru has partnered with Marriott
International to open six hotels in the southern belt; Embassy Group is
working with Hilton and Four Seasons Hotels to open four more hotels in
Bengaluru. Godrej Properties in Mumbai has collaborated with Taj Hotels
to open a 5-star luxury property in their Vikhroli township called The
Trees.

CHANDIGARH, Feb. 29 -- What does a modern workplace look like? Does it
look and feel like an open, bustling cafe? Or is it more like a
futuristic, tech-driven space with cutting-edge gadgets? Do indoor
greens add that "cool" factor to it, or does it have dedicated gaming,
meditation, and fitness areas to encourage holistic employee well-being?
There's a simple answer to these complicated questions: no one thing.
When creating workplaces for new-age professionals, organizations must
tread a fine balance. So, if you're looking to create a workplace for
the future, here are some thoughts for you to consider:

Bringing nature in

As they neared the turn of the millennium, and steeled themselves for
the Y2K
bug[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/23/style/y2k-bug-millennials.html],
Americans faced a critical question: Whom would they crown the teen
queen of pop?

In 1999 there were four candidates. Britney Spears was an early
front-runner, riding the breakout success of “… Baby One More Time.”
Christina Aguilera, her fellow former Mouseketeer, was cast as Ms.
Spears’s direct opponent. Jessica
Simpson[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/style/jessica-simpson-memoir-alcohol-addiction.html]
entered the field as a quieter, more chaste presence. And then there was
Mandy Moore.

New Delhi, Feb. 29 -- It's been a recurring cycle of endless hiring and
firing at international fashion houses. The latest example is Raf Simons
joining Prada as co-creative director after a stint with Calvin Klein of
less than two years. The Belgian designer, who had previously departed
Christian Dior after three-and-a-half years, will work alongside Miuccia
Prada on their first joint collection due in September. Another designer
is Alessandro Dell'Acqua, who bid adieu to Rochas after six years at the
helm! These are the telling signs which make one question if creative
directors face constant pressure to create offerings which reap rich
dividends. And also if brands no longer shy away from diluting their
core identities in the interest of millennials and *Gen-Z* buyers.

FOREVER TRENDIf you were lucky enough to own one in the Nineties, now is
the time to dig it out again, says Tamara Abraham

There's a scene in the TV series Sex and the City in which lead
character Carrie Bradshaw (played by Sarah Jessica Parker) is mugged at
gunpoint. "Give me your bag," orders the assailant. "It's a baguette!"
she wails, before reluctantly handing over her small, purple-sequinned
purse.

Homes are not only getting increasingly compact in nature, but also
well-connected, thus making it easier to move amidst the various rooms
that occupy the house

'Small is the new big' - this famous adage rings true today, especially
if recent reports are to be believe. After all, the top seven Indian
cities collectively saw average apartment sizes shrink by nearly 17 per
cent between 2014 and 2018, according to ANAROCK data. "With increase in
urbanisation, property prices have only seen an upward trend in the past
two decades and subsequently, the advent of compact housing. Not to
forget, millennials and *Gen Z* are rapidly growing to be the larger
dividend of the population. Hence, it is no surprise that we have
downsized our homes," says Rajat mathur, business head, Script by Godrej
& Boyce.

Sleep deprivation is one of the reasons behind the rising incidence of
serious illnesses — diabetes, heart attack and cancer, among others — in
young and middle-aged Indians. This is an age group whose sleep hours
are often given over to late nights at work, binge watching on TV and
smartphones. Medical professionals explain why it’s time to switch off
completely, come bedtime Vivek Gulati* didn’t know it, but he was an
owl. The young marketing professional, who tracked European clients for
his Gurugram-based firm, worked late into the evenings. Back home he
needed to unwind before the telly — watching his favourite Premier
League matches or the latest on Netflix. He was up till well after
midnight. He was convinced he led a healthy life — he didn’t smoke or
drink, was fanatic about his daily workouts and jogged every morning.

companies: Ashok Leyland CEO Millennials are becoming the majority of
the workforce, and they are soon going to take leadership roles in most

and challenging, but also offers huge opportunities for companies, said

BENGALURU: Seven in 10 *Gen Z* respondents spend more than six to eight
hours on their smartphones, shows a new survey titled ‘Growing Pain
Issues in *Gen Z* Workforce’. According to the research paper released
by furniture brand Godrej Interio, 38% of them use laptops for more than
6-8 hours a day, suggesting that much of the daytime of *Gen-Z* is spent
on gadgets. The survey also revealed that 37% of the generation spends
more than five hours a day watching Smart-TVs connected to the Internet
for entertainment. The study reveals that due to excessive use of
gadgets, incorrect postures adopted while using these gadgets, and
improper design of learning spaces used for studying or project work,
many Gen-Zers are prone to suffering from multiple pain issues. The most
prevalent physical disorders include postural defects and pain including
neck pain, lower back pain, and headache. “Technology is a defining
trait of *Gen-Z*. They rely on it constantly to learn and grow creatively.

More inclusive critical illness cover and support for modern families,
that's not just about the numbers

Modern families are dramatically different to days gone by.The nuclear
family - of a father, mother and ‘2.4 children' - is no longer the norm.
In fact, nowadays, there is no normal. More of us will have
step-children, step-parents and second families.

Despite the changing times and increasing strain on operators to cope
with a tighter labor pool and the shifting priorities of consumers, the
foodservice industry has a bright future, according to the National
Restaurant Association’s annual State of the Industry Report. Restaurant
sales are projected to reach $889 billion in 2020 with a 4% growth rate,
faster than industry sales growth of 3.6% or $863 billion in 2019.
[https://www.nrn.com/sales-trends/us-restaurant-sales-reach-record-863b-2019-nra-says]


That projected growth is driven by the fact that consumers are more
confident in their spending power, driven by a healthy labor market, and

Most available evidence points in the direction of a popular vote and
Electoral College victory.

Whatever you think about Bernie Sanders as a potential president, it is
wrong to dismiss his chances of winning the office. Not only does most
of the available empirical evidence show Mr. Sanders defeating President
Trump in the national popular vote and in the critical Midwestern states
that tipped the Electoral College in 2016, but his specific electoral
strengths align with changes in the composition of the country’s
population in ways that could actually make him a formidable foe for the
president.

Don't judge a book by its cover might be an apt metaphor for eyeing *Gen Z*.

A new survey about *Gen Z* from global consultancy EY provides
directional guidance for CPG marketers -- including the insight that
those born between 1997 and 2007 aren't one homogeneous mass of young
consumers endlessly promoting themselves on social media.

A tsunami of social media hype and celebratory trend pieces have already
made White Claw a sensation in the United States. And so the hard
seltzer's long-awaited Canadian debut this weekend comes with no
shortage of expectations for similarly effervescent fortunes.

Its Vancouver-born creator Anthony von Mandl, CEO of the Mark Anthony
Group, says he's bewildered by the stunning rise of the low-cal drink
previously only available to cross-border shoppers and tourists.

2020 MAR 7 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at
Investment Weekly News -- Young people are politically engaged and
invested in the issues that matter to their communities. As the 2020
presidential candidates seek to engage millennials and *Gen Z* in
electoral politics, Teen Vogue released the findings of the 2020 Young
Voter Survey, conducted in partnership with market-research company
Ipsos, which polled more than 2,000 people ages 18 to 34 and identified
which issues are most important to them. Featured as part of Teen
Vogue's ongoing #TeenVote2020 coverage leading up to the November
election, the findings reveal that young Americans are more unified
across party lines and more socially progressive than older
counterparts, and they are likely to vote in the upcoming presidential
election.

ONE OF the biggest changes in the way businesses relate to the outside
world is how they deal with apologies and work in progress.

It used to be that many businesses adopted a 'never apologise never
explain' attitude or at least 'don't apologise unless you absolutely
have to' approach.

Afterpay has found an opening in the U.S. by targeting the millennials
who don't have a credit card to use at the point of sale.

One effect of the CARD Act of 2009 — which largely forbids issuing
credit cards to consumers under 21 and severely restricts credit card
marketing on college campuses — is that many millennials have thin
credit histories. This, paired with their large amount of student debt,
has kept many millennials out of the mainstream credit card
market[https://www.paymentssource.com/news/why-issuersand-amazonare-bringing-back-secured-cards].

Charles Guzzetta told the Business Journal. While the brand has taken
strides in the past nine years toward becoming the go-to fast-casual
burger chain for the region, he said there is still room to grow.

Whether you're a baby boomer or *Gen Z*, you probably haven't been able

No. 1 single in 1977 (off the "Bigger Than Both of Us" album), and
"Maneater," their longest-running chart-topper in 1982. But the stories
behind the songs may have you listening in a whole new way. As they get

to any other candidate running for president in 2020, but how could it
move the needle?

* While voters under the age of 30 tend to be among the least reliable
to turn up to the polls, then-Sen. Barack Obama's 2008 campaign showed
how they can put wins on the board for the right candidate.

New Delhi, Feb. 28 -- On their maiden visit to India, Z-Stars - an
international K-pop act - recently performed in Pune, Mumbai and Delhi.
The group stars two Indians - Sid and Priyanka - who were ecstatic to be
performing as international stars in their own country. "When you get a
chance to perform with your whole group on home ground, it's the best
feeling ever," says Sid. Priyanka adds, "I was nervous as it was my
first time as a global artiste in front of my mother. I'm glad that our
group enjoyed the time here, thanks to the enthusiastic audience."

Ask questions and test assumptions to get at the heart of the challenges
your business faces.

'When the winds of change blow, some people build walls and others build
windmills," goes a Chinese proverb. The winds of disruptive change are
certainly blowing hard as we embark on a new decade.

*HD* 	Why stores in Beijing and Shanghai are empty - and it's not just

China may be the world's largest market for luxury goods - but while
Chanel, Gucci, Hermès, Dior and others are all represented in Tier-1
cities, the bulk of purchases are still made on trips abroad - where
products are up to 40 per cent cheaper

To keep up with 20 per cent annual growth in the Chinese luxury goods
market, top-flight brands are working hard to train staff in London and
Paris. Yet amid booming sales, stores in Beijing and Shanghai seemed
empty long before coronavirus drove shoppers away from malls.

Teenagers are campaigning, debating, running fact checks and forming
party-based coalitions (hype houses). One of them called it “cable news
for young people.”

As Twitter and Facebook continue to dominate conversations about social
media and the 2020 presidential election, TikTok is quietly becoming a
political force.

ARI SHAPIRO: Millennial and *Gen Z* shoppers concerned about the
environment are pushing fashion brands, especially purveyors of fast
fashion, to change their business models. Stacey Vanek Smith and Sally
Herships from our daily economics podcast The Indicator from Planet
Money explore how H&M plans to start renting clothing in a bid to appeal
to its environmentally conscious young consumers.

STACEY VANEK SMITH: So H&M has a problem. It sells fast fashion from the
best in the business, but its customers are mostly young shoppers, like
millennials and Gen Zers, and they increasingly care about the
environment and about labor practices.

LaQuan Smith sent amazing creations down the runway during his
Fall/Winter New York Fashion Week show. His collections are all about
empowering women to feel good about themselves via what they’re wearing.
And this season it included black, stacked stovepipe jeans with moto
detailing and denim bustiers, part of his ongoing collaboration with
Jordache.

“I wanted to say something that was really impactful,” Smith
told Billboard in an interview about the collection. “What I’m creating
with [the line] is something that you want to be a part of. It’s
something that has this superstardom aesthetic. That level of confidence
is just powerful and it has a lot of value.”

Ooh la la! No matter how many times a star in a see-through gown struts
down the red carpet, the public tends to react with raised eyebrows and
dropped jaws.

This awards season, from the Golden Globes to the Grammys, there was a
particularly high volume of oohing and aahing from stargazers because
many celebs have decided to go sheer this year, and the trend is
trickling down to the public, too.

New Delhi, Feb. 27 -- Swedish audio streaming service Spotify may have
entered India lured by its young Internet savvy base but has realized
within one year of operations that music knows no boundaries of age.
While GenZ and millennials drive the most streams on popular music
genres like film music, international pop, and Punjabi non-film music on
Spotify, it's the 35-44 year-old users who listen the most to local
music, the company said in a statement.

As the world's digitalisation has become an opportunity as well as a
challenge for many, some information technology experts are organising a
one-day Digital Pakistan Conference at the Pearl Continental Hotel on
April 15 to address the potential and grievances of the virtual marketplace.

Addressing a news conference at the Karachi Press Club's seminar hall,
AMFCO Technologies CEO Maroof Ayub said that in this country people may
not have electricity reaching their homes but they have at least one
smartphone in their family, which creates a huge progress opportunity.

There's been a lot of talk recently about meat alternatives, but dairy
alternatives are also becoming more popular. And when it comes to dairy
in Canada, given our quotas and high tariffs, the stakes are
significantly higher.

Dairy alternatives can be seen virtually everywhere. These specialty
products are no longer confined to the dusty shelves of specialty food
and health stores or located in some obscure place in a major grocery
store. They are now quite visible. Rice milk, soy milk and other
substitutes like oat, almond, cashew, coconut and even hemp milk are now
widespread across the country. And it's happening fast.

commenting favourably on someone's haircut, or asking them where they
bought their shoes, or saying how adorable their baby is (even if it's

Many in fashion are horrified by the idea. That doesn't mean it's wrong.

Virgil Abloh, the founder of Off-White and the men's wear designer of
Louis Vuitton, is the kind of fashion figure that seems to demand

Disney characters have been a perennial hit with children's clothing.
But the world famous Mickey Mouse has gone mainstream. Whether it's
high-street stores like Zara and H&M selling t-shirts and sweatshirts
with Mickey proudly embossed on them to Gucci adding Disney magic on its
loafers, sneakers, silk pajamas and bags, the mouse is everywhere.

Adults are willing to spend Rs 70,000 to a few lakhs on designer gear
featuring a popular cartoon character. What is the logic? Well, it is
the year of the mouse and Gucci's creative director Alessandro Michele
decided to celebrate the Chinese New Year by paying home to Mickey.
