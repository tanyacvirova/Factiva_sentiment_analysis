Mergers & Acquisitions has been featuring the Most Influential Women in
Mid-Market M&A for five years. During that time, the profile of women in
the dealmaking world has been raised significantly. Dozens of new
initiatives, such as networking groups and mentoring programs, have been
launched, with many thriving today. And, anecdotally, many people in the
middle market say the industry is changing.

The impact of including women on deal teams has been proven to improve
performance significantly, according to a study conducted by Oliver
Gottschalg, a professor at HEC Paris. Gender-diverse PE investment
committees outperformed all-male investment committees substantially, as
measured by several metrics: 7 percent more alpha; .52x more total value
to paid-in multiple; and 12 percent higher internal rate of return. Also
impressive: the failure rate of gender-diverse investment committees was
8 percent lower.

As you think ahead to how you can help make a difference in the new
year, here are three things not to do.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 nearly doubled the standard
deduction and has changed the way some people approach their tax
strategies. Despite the fact that the law reduced tax savings for each
charitable dollar, charitable giving has increased, especially through
donor-advised funds (DAFs) and the application of wise retirement
investment planning.

2020 JAN 1 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at
Education Letter -- The oldest Millennials, who will turn 40 in 2020,
have lived through a turbulent decade of housing marked first by the
initial recovery from the Great Recession, then the extraordinary home
value growth of recent years. Due in large part to a variety of
affordability challenges delaying all sorts of major life milestones,
the homeownership rate among young people has fallen significantly over
the decade. However, fifteen years from now, *Gen Z* will age into a
more favorable market, according to a panel of economists and real
estate experts.

The Zillow(R) Home Price Expectations Surveyi, sponsored by Zillow and
conducted quarterly by Pulsenomics LLC, asks more than 100 economists,
investment strategists and real estate experts for their predictions
about the U.S. housing market. The Q4 survey also asked panelists about
their expectations for future homeownership rates.

Millennials[https://www.businessinsider.com/category/millennials?utm_source=dowjones&utm_medium=ingest]
have been blamed for killing everything from beer to
napkins[https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-hurt-industries-sales-2018-10?utm_source=dowjones&utm_medium=ingest]
over the past decade.

* "Millennials are killing" headlines faced backlash as it became clear
that the generation wasn't choosing to kill industries. Millennials have
a bleaker economic reality than older generations.

Protests in Chile. (Photo: Flickr)By Esteban Zapata

One of the questions that have emerged in recent years (and which the
liberals and libertarians have unfortunately failed to answer and do not
counter) is why the left became a radicalized, identity and irrational
ideology in recent years. Communist and socialist ideas resurfaced in
this decade with unusual force, transcending all areas: spectacle,
media, private companies and, of course, demagogue and populist
politicians, when they were initially isolated in public universities.

U.S. population growth slowed from an annual average of 0.97% in the
2000s to 0.66% in the 2010s, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

Natural increase — the extent to which births outpaced deaths —
accounted for more growth than did immigration, but both metrics
weakened year-by-year.

Delays, overcrowding, trash, rats and a chronic lack of money – New
York’s subway is in disarray. Can an ambitious new blueprint fix things?

It was the summer of 2017, as New York’s subway trains groaned along on
near-100-year-old equipment, throttled by a decades-long lack of
funding, when things really came to a head.

As I wrote last week, the 2010s was a decade of discontent and distrust,
of doubts and despair, all amplified by governments and corporations
using new information (and disinformation) technologies.

Now, more than ever, we need mid-level activism that goes beyond
personal new year resolutions and instead tackles, with doable targets,
our own backyards: ourhomes, schools and offices.

India, Jan. 1 -- Actor Soha Ali Khan is quite serious when it comes to
her fitness and diet plans. The 41-year-old feels maintaining a strict
fitness regime and diet pattern has helped her immensely, not just on a
personal level, but on a professional level as well. "I follow a
training routine that focuses not just on my day to day goals but on
longevity. It requires a lot of dedication and patience with the correct
approach and takes real hard work and will to endure our body. This has
helped me attain discipline in life, which has certainly helped me a lot
in my profession," she says.

Soha goes on to add, "Progressive health and wellness awareness is
dominating the trend as everyone seeks nutritious profiles and has a
fair understanding of nutritional information. Especially, the
millennials and *Gen Z* people are setting standards of healthy food as
I read somewhere that these folks are actually some of the healthiest
eaters."

Mumbai: Technically, Rohit Jadhav should be frantic about the new year.
On February 10, 2020, Jadhav, a Prabhadevi lad studying engineering in
Bengaluru, will turn 20—that twilight zone between teenage and adulthood
when elders would expect the digital native to quit staring into his
phone and start adulting. Yet, there’s no hint of panic in the tone of
this self-confessed “woke” teen who writes blogs on women’s empowerment
and thinks up a web series featuring Batman’s Joker when he is not
studying electronics. “If I don’t get a job,” he says, “I will create my
own.”Jadhav’s calm is symbolic of a strain of optimism that seems to
pervade an entire generation that will come of age next year. Despite
the gloom of joblessness in the air which makes the metaphorical
crossroads appear like a rather bleak place to be, teens on the verge of
20 not only betray a fierce sense of optimism about the future but also
express their desire to build a life in India.

Person of the Year, 2019? Like every year, there were several
contenders.The planet recorded its highest-ever temperature and the
highest decibels on climate change. Greta Thunberg, the young rebellion
against mankind’s extinction, was a strong candidate. How Dare We Let
the Amazon burn, Venetian alleys flood, Australian bushfires rage and
Delhi choke?Odds of a catastrophe may not be evened by retiring cars,
moving the COP 25 from Chile to Madrid or by changing capitals (Jakarta
to Kalimantan).There are a few good signs – EU’s push for a circular
economy, democratic candidates’ green new deal, the rise of green
parties and innovations funded by the likes of Bill Gates.Christine
Lagarde gets full marks for joining Mark Carney in making green finance
a central agenda for central banks. For lasting change, we must stop
flying private jets to inconclusive climate conferences.

For all the predictions published on New Year's Day 2010, none forecast
the events that would violently and sporadically punctuate life in the
dawning decade.

And because we were blissfully ignorant to the 10 years we were about to
live through, we also didn't foresee we would rise with gutsy courage
and compassion.

In a KakaoTalk group chat gathering 300 fans of Pengsoo, users vented
their anger when the character appeared at a promotional event for a
movie on Dec. 16.

Some of them insisted they should send emails of protest to the
production team at Educational Broadcasting System and ask them to
refrain from commercial uses of Pengsoo -- a costumed live-action
penguin character that has quickly gained popularity in Korea for its
straight-talking wit.
