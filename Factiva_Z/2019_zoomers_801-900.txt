February is Black History Month, as well as National Women's History
Month, which is celebrated in March, despite Susan B. Anthony's
birthdate being Feb. 15. As such, I wanted to look at the subject of
diversity in media. The industry has both an opportunity and an
obligation to support diversity and inclusion across its many platforms,
and as I'll outline below, promoting diversity also contributes to our
bottom line.

Army Secretary Mark Esper has directed an influential advisory panel to
study how the service finds new soldiers, puts them to work and nurtures
their careers to ensure a personnel management system is aligned with
plans to modernize the force for future fights.

On Jan. 4, Esper directed the Army Science Board to conduct a study on
"Reforming Talent Management in the Army." The study aims to ensure the
service is focused on what leaders frequently say is the Army's most
important asset: people.

Hillary Clinton says something extraordinary' is happening over climate
change as teenagers like Greta Thunberg in Sweden, Anuna De Wever in
Belgium and Holly Gillibrand in Fort William lead school-strike
protests, writes Susan Dalgety.

Hillary Clinton passed a powerful baton earlier this week to a new
generation of women. In a tweet, she pointed out that something
"extraordinary" was happening in Europe "and perhaps soon in America".

As Julián Castro officially launched his candidacy for president over
the past few weeks, he invoked a certain female figure so frequently she
might as well have been his running mate.

On Dec. 12, as he declared that he was forming an exploratory committee,
Castro, 44, a Texas Democrat who served as secretary of housing and
urban development during President Barack Obama's second term, stood in
front of a painting of Our Lady of Guadalupe, the Catholic Church's
patron saint of Mexico. The date was auspicious, too: Dec. 12 is the
Lady of Guadalupe's feast day.

There are so many rules around advertising now, be them from the
Advertising Standards Authority or the Portman Group. Here we highlight
some of the defining moments in marketing and advertising and look at
how regulation and legislation has changed the way drinks brands and
pubs market their products and services.

This spring, the sixth edition of the Portman Group’s code of practice
will be published, with some additional guidelines to address areas such
as sexism in marketing and implications that alcohol can improve mood,
expected to be included.

For many food and beverage brands, their product packaging is their
first – if not only – touchpoint with consumers, and yet all too often
companies treat it as an afterthought or as little more than a
protective exterior for what is inside.

According to the CEO of the design and branding firm
Crowdspring[https://www.crowdspring.com/blog/] Ross Kimbarovsky,
packaging that is unattractive, outdated or that fails to adequately
communicate what is inside can result in missed sales as consumers pass
over the products on store shelves.

2019 FEB 22 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at
Insurance Weekly News -- Led by insurtech disruptors, novel business
models are causing disintermediation in the insurance industry and
altering power dynamics. The rise of technologies such as Artificial
Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), and smart devices is
placing the spotlight on flexible services based on usage-based
insurance, on-demand insurance and Prevention-as-a-Service models, which
are redefining the role of insurance in people's lives. These models
will especially appeal to Millennials and *Generation Z*, the newest
buying groups.

After last summer’s anorak trend comes the humble fleece; the key is in
cut and colour

Now that the bitterly cold, 10-jumpers-and-winter-coat weather is giving
way to something slightly less bleak, fashion is following suit with a
hot new trend: step forward the fleece.

As he lays the groundwork for the Liberals'last budget before the fall
election, federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau has been highlighting
two themes for a national drug plan: the twin drives for lower costs and
wider access.

Drugs are the fastest-growing component in health spending in Canada,
according to the Canadian Institute for Health Information. New drugs
have made it possible to live much longer with conditions such as
diabetes and even cancer, and improve patients'quality of life with
afflictions such as arthritis. But unlike hospital care and
doctors'visits, most people's medication needs aren't covered by public
health insurance.

Liberty Shoes has been in the footwear business for ages, always looking
to diversify its current product base. The group's CEO Adesh Gupta says
the company settled on making inroads into lifestyle. In an exclusive
interview with S&A;, the CEO explains, "After a lot of research, we
finally zeroed down on perfumes because the fragrance segment currently
occupies 5 per cent share of the total lifestyle market in India giving
us a huge window for growth. The need for personal grooming has slowly
increased and inched its way into the minds of milenials as a need more
than a luxury."

ALMOST a third of employees in the West Midlands said they would rather
use telemedicine services than visit their GP practice.

A study of 2,000 UK workers by Willis Towers Watson found that 30 per
cent of workers in the region would rather go online and use video links
to access GP services, such as medical advice, consultations or
prescriptions.

Little about The Wonderful Company’s new wine brand is practical.
Brought from conception to market in less than a year, the JNSQ brand
recently came on the market with a line of rosé and sauvignon blanc—in
the middle of winter. The ornate packaging was inspired by vintage
luxury perfume bottles, created by a French glass designer and features
resealable glass stoppers for reusability.

Armed with the insight that preferences among millennial wine drinkers,
and millennial women in particular, had shifted toward rosé and
sauvignon blanc, marketers at The Wonderful Company—best-known for Fiji
Water andPistachios—decided to create a new wine brand: JNSQ.

How can brands still be getting it so wrong? In an age where the
most-desired market segments — Millennials, Gen X and older *Gen Z*
consumers — are driven by values, and especially diversity and
inclusion and the positions that brands take, the fact that brands still
release racist products and ads is mind-boggling.

Nowhere is this more evident than in the fashion industry. Just last
week Gucci and Adidas joined the ranks of H&M, Dolce & Gabbana, Prada
and others in releasing products and ads that convey racist messages,
whether intentional or not — presumably not. Gucci’s balaclava-style
sweater evoking blackface imagery and Adidas’ all-white shoe in a line
meant to celebrate Black History Month is not just embarrassing to the
companies but potentially damaging to their reputation and internal morale.

Millennials and *Gen Z* really are different than older generations,
according to a new survey from Epsilon.

The survey, “Age matters: A guide to cross-generation marketing,” found
a noticeable change in spending and brand interactions among Millennial
and *Gen Z* consumers, who generally prefer self-serve options and
services that put consumers in control.

Thursday marks the first anniversary of the massacre at Marjory Stoneman
Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., the shooting that took 17 lives.
Over the past year, 1,200 children 18 or younger have died as a result
of gun violence in the United States, according to a report released
this week by the Trace. Among the dead: Christian Robinson, 14, "who
tried to make people laugh every day," Carolina Monsanto, 16, "who had
dreams of becoming a nurse," and Cody Worden, 13, "a wrestler, a
football player and Little Leaguer."

A few weeks ago in a family conversation about the future of my parents,
my mother said very convinced that "in the end, she was going to be
alone", referring to her and my father, assuming that feeling of
loneliness that already seems to be something of her own of the life of
the elderly.

A similar sentiment was the one that motivated the death of the couple
of older adults occurred earlier this month, and that reminds us of the
situation in which we live old age in our country. As in the case of
Jorge and Elsa of July of last year, a couple of 94 and 86 years ago,
decided to take their own lives leaving a letter explaining that they no
longer wanted to be a burden to their family.

If you want to win with today’s consumers you need to give them the food
they want, where they want it and when they want it. The solution to
meeting those demands, according to the latest research from The NPD
Group, is for operators to deliver digital convenience.

“[Digital and delivery] are really among the only sources of growth in
the industry,” said David Portalatin, NPD vice president and food
industry analyst.

Rigid definitions of sexuality are on the way out, as a younger
generation embraces a ‘never say never’ approach to sex and gender

Nick Meadowcroft-Lunn has a girlfriend, whom he has been seeing for
three years. Jezz Palmer has a girlfriend, too, and they have been
together for five. You might assume therefore that Nick is straight and
Jezz is gay; or, if not, that both must be bisexual. But you would be wrong.

Propped with his style crew against the putty-tone headboard of a
lumbering, half-made bed, Nay Campbell was in his element. The setting
was a blandly furnished room in the once storied New Yorker Hotel on the
edge of Hell's Kitchen. An Art Deco monument that has seen better days,
the hotel, with its pallid interiors and half-lit corridors, could have
served as a backdrop for one of Andy Warhol's louche, loosely rambling
films.

On a recent Monday morning the hotel was the scene of a fashion shoot.
Mr. Campbell's oddly assorted elastic-limbed models, dancers and a
publicist's mother vamped in wispy negligee silks, taffeta minis and
tailored gabardines that were evocative simultaneously of Russ Meyer's
big-screen bombshells and fragile Warhol waifs.

Online travel company MakeMyTrip recently revealed what it does with the
Rs 5 contribution that customers make while making bookings on the
platform. The company announced that it has supported the plantation of
over one million trees over the last ten years in Rajasthan with its NGO
partner, Seva Mandir. Excerpts of an interview with MakeMyTrip founder
and Group CEO Deep Kalra: Sustainability is not the word associated with
new economy internet companies in India. What made MakeMyTrip start
thinking about it ten years ago? I have always believed that every
organisation, irrespective of size, can be used as a force to do some
good in the world. Contributing to the well-being of communities or the
environment we operate in doesn’t have to be the preserve of super-sized
corporations or global business behemoths alone. As India’s one-stop
travel shop, we felt it was incumbent on us to promote responsible travel.

The Instagram influencer as a species is easy to spot.

Defined by their large social media followings, this class of marketers
produces content typically awash with the flossy trappings of young
money: trendy designer outfits modeled in exotic locations; marble
countertops under carefully crafted flat-lays of pricey beauty products.
Even the Instagram mavens with a grittier, every-girl style, all
Polaroid grunginess, are dotted with on-brand T-shirts perfectly
half-tucked into the hot jeans du jour.

<th>February 13, 2019 (Washington, D.C.)—A new comprehensive research
study into *Gen Z* from Atlantic Re:think, The Atlantic’s creative
marketing group, done together with Comscore and Harvard College
Consulting Group, finds the media outlets, brands, and careers that
appeal to Millennials aren’t as enticing to *Gen Z*—with the
post-Millennial generation proving harder to win over as citizens,
consumers, and professionals.

YouTube and Facebook Watch compete head-on. They compete for eyeballs
and market share. But they also compete for talent—in the content
creators producing videos for each platform. The problem is that they
don’t play nicely together.

Facebook’s algorithm actively de-emphasizes any YouTube links to their
content shared on Facebook. Unfortunately, that doesn’t mean content
creators get to pick or choose. It’s not one vs. the other. Yes, it’s a
pain to export and distribute both. Yes, it adds a few extra steps. But
spoiler alert: it’s still worth it.

When you think of a "gamer," you might imagine the stereotype of
teenagers or thirtysomething guys intensely playing Xbox or Playstation
for hours at a time.

But thanks to the proliferation of smartphones, a wider swath of people
are playing games — even if a majority of them would not call themselves
"gamers," a new study finds.

The entire Roll Up the Rim campaign rests on the physicality of the cup
itself.

Almost 300-million cups are produced for the campaign, which usually
ends in mid-April. Some winners have been required to send in the entire
cup to claim their prize, instead of just ripping off the tab. But to
redeem any prize, a cup is required, which is something tangible.

A message to media brands and advertisers: millennials and *Gen Z* are
not the same audience.

That's based on a new study conducted by The Atlantic's creative

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Census Bureau has a problem that some parents of
millennials will recognize: These adults often don’t call. They don’t
write. If you want to reach them, you have to use social media. The 2010
way — mailing a paper form with a follow-up knock on the door or call to
a landline — just won’t work for many of the residents the bureau needs
to find. State and local governments are helping the agency work to
avoid undercounts that sap funding and political power. “Mail? I feel
like that’s a dead thing,” said Tim Slayton, 36, a Washington, D.C.,
resident for 18 years. “And I don’t have a lot of people randomly
knocking at my front door, so I would be a little weirded out. ‘Census
Bureau!’ It sounds like a joke. It sounds like you just want me to open
my door.

LONDON — You may not have heard of Liu Haoran, or Turbo Liu as he’s
called outside of China, but when it was revealed last week that he’d
become the face of Louis Vuitton’s second smartwatch, the Tambour
Horizon, you could say he nearly broke China’s Internet.

Thousands of excited comments flooded Louis Vuitton’s Instagram account
after the brand revealed the actor, China’s equivalent of Timothée
Chalamet, will be endorsing the watch and the new wireless Horizon
Earphones, $995, along with Justin Theroux and Sophie Turner.

School pupils striking over climate change are part of a generation
that’s determined, articulate and well informed

Who do we think is being more grown-up? On the one side we have Liz
Truss, chief secretary to the Treasury, tweeting selfies with Taylor
Swift. She is joined by two MPs who mocked their colleague Michael
Fabricant, claiming he wore a wig, and many more who are moaning about
having to make decisions about their country’s future on Valentine’s Day.

Binge-drinking, poor diet and processed meats are contributing to
soaring rates of bowel cancer in young Scots, experts say.

Children as young as ten are being diagnosed, while rates have doubled
among people in their 20s and reached a record high for those aged 30 to
34. People born after 1996, the so-called *Gen Z*, have seen a rise in
diagnoses.

Paint Nite rebrands itself as Yaymakers, with ukulele-making and candle
crafting, to feed consumers' appetite for doing things instead of buying
products

CAMBRIDGE — David Daykin raised his arms over his head like an aerobics
instructor: “Give me a Y! Give me an A! Give a Y!" he shouted into his
headset microphone, exhorting two dozen strangers gathered at a Kendall
Square Bertucci's to get revved up for an evening of ukulele-making.

Maybelline[https://www.glossy.co/beauty/how-being-backstage-at-nyfw-drives-business-for-beauty-brands]

recently been turning to NYFW as a brand awareness play.

HSBC "We are not an island" outdoor ads hit back at isolationism,
claiming the UK is "not an island". Local executions aimed at
Birmingham, Leeds, London and Manchester issue rallying cries for each
place, pointing out all the details of British life that are indebted to
the nation's connections to the wider world. Facing an uproar from
Brexiteers, HSBC denied that the campaign had anything to do with the
nation's current political crisis - which diluted some of the power of
its message.

It’s 2019 and influencers are quickly cementing themselves as brands and
customer service experts in their own right. Every day we see
influencers who are growing powerful customer networks and forming
highly profitable partnerships. This, combined with the rise of
direct-to-consumer (DTC) brands and Instagram shopping, gives
traditional brands a valid reason to worry.

In our fast-paced, digital-first world, influencers have demonstrated a
deep understanding of how to effectively capitalize on fans’ desires and
grow loyal, global communities through authentic, person-to-person
communication. And amidst this influencer explosion, brands who are
paying attention can learn a lot from this new flock of customer service
experts.

Despite being Tennessee's largest private employer, FedEx Corp. has
never had a large office presence in Downtown Memphis.

A visit to a Memphis Grizzlies game caused FedEx Logistics CEO Richard
Smith to re-evaluate that. Now, his company is set to locate 660 jobs in
the Gibson Guitar Factory
building[https://www.bizjournals.com/memphis/news/2019/02/12/fedex-announces-680-jobs-downtown.html]

Florida is growing fast, and Northeast Florida along with it. However,
in order for Northeast Florida to remain competitive against nearby
cities, the region must move swiftly on talent development, JaxUSA
Partnership President Aundra Wallace told the Business Journal in a
sit-down interview Monday.

"The demographics, employment, economics - everything about Florida is
changing," Wallace said. "To compete now, from a regional aspect,
whoever wins the war over talent attraction, talent development and
talent retention will now be better positioned to win more of the
battles over the attraction and expansion and retention of companies."

To win digitally-connected customers, retailers continue to adapt. If
traditional companies have significantly changed their strategies, some
new players like Casper, Wayfair and Made.com operate with completely
different models. How can such different firms compete in a similar
market? "I've already bought chairs, tables, rugs and mirrors online",
said Matthew, an Engineer (aged 40), a dad of 3 children in Boston.
"However, I would never buy a sofa I didn't sit on or be able to touch.
Then again, returning a chair or sofa would be painful. You have to use
a service lift. It's not easy to manage". Historically, the domestic
furnishings and equipment sector has been slower than other verticals in
embracing an omni-channel approach. Stores are based in suburbs with
bulky items which are expensive to stock. Delivery is expensive.
Customers are reluctant to buy big ticket products without physically
testing items.

Involved in a strategical shift, the Swedish Ikea Group is widening its
city-centre footprint with an array of urban stores to open this year,
including in Manhattan and in Paris (in May 2019, covering a sales area
of 5,400 sq.m: four times smaller than a typical Ikea unit). Within the
next three years, 30 units of this type are planned, notably in San
Francisco, Los Angeles and in Washington D.C. The goal of urban formats
and online sales is to complement our superstores, which remain our
strategic pillar", said to Les Echos the Group's C.E.O. Jesper Brodin.
"Looking at the breadth of their product range, superstores remain the
best place for customers to find relevant inspiration, particularly when
they just moved in to a new property. We do not plan to convert or
reduce space of these big boxes. Actually, some of them are too small to
cope with the shoppers' footfall".

CASES of bowel cancer are soaring among Scots too young to qualify for
screening, with children as young as 10 among those being diagnosed.

Diagnoses have doubled among Scots in their early 20s, while rates of
bowel cancer in the 30 to 34 age group are at a record high.

CAMBRIDGE — David in raised his arms over his head like an aerobics
instructor: “Give me a Y! Give me an A! Give a Y!" he shouted into his
headset microphone, exhorting two dozen strangers gathered at a Kendall
Square Bertucci's to get revved up for an evening of ukulele-making. 

The tables were covered with dismembered instruments. Over the next
three hours, the necks and bodies of tiny guitars would be painted, then
assembled using tiny drills. But first, in wanted to set the mood:
Nothing, he instructed the crowd, should get in the way of the “yay."

RACHEL MARTIN: So what's a club DJ to do when a lot of kids would rather
sit at home and play video games instead of go out and dance? DJ
Marshmello recently tried to solve that problem by making himself part
of one of the most popular video games out there. He created an avatar
of himself and staged a performance inside Fortnite.

For those blissfully unaware, Fortnite is a virtual battlefield game
played by millions around the world, often at the same time - not
exactly the place you'd expect a dance party to break out. It was the
first ever Fortnite concert. And as NPR's Elizabeth Blair reports, it
was such a hit, we're probably going to see more.
