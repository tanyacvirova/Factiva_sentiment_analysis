The mobile short-form streaming platform Quibi has been the talk of the
town since it was announced that founder Jeffrey Katzenberg and CEO Meg
Whitman were launching it. The streaming platform is set to launch in
April, has raised $1 billion in funding and been backed by major
Hollywood studios including the Walt Disney Company, NBCUniversal, Sony
Pictures, WarnerMedia and ViacomCBS.

But with all of its clout, money and alignments with some of the biggest
names in entertainment, many are still skeptical about Quibi. That may
change after this year’s CES in Las Vegas, where Quibi will present its
platform to audiences in an attempt to make believers out of naysayers.

LAS VEGAS (Expansion).- Within the conception of balance in Avatar,
James Cameron's film, the closeness to the environment and the beings
that inhabited this space was to maintain a symbiosis of resources where
it was brought to the environment, but also took advantage of it.
However, in the case of human beings this rule has been broken more than
once and therefore there are currently problems of climate change and
exploitation of natural resources, in the face of this the contribution
of each company and business sector is fundamental.Mercedes Benz decided
to launch Vision AVTR, a car that in addition to having a battery
powered by electric energy 100% made of recycled products, is
complemented by an innovative design where the materials, both external
and inside, are 'conscious' Environmentally.

Millennials and younger members of Gen X have tended to be the biggest
consumers of organic and natural foods, but now, the youngest generation
of adult consumers – *Gen Z* (ages 18-24) – is beginning to command the
category.

A new report by Packaged
Facts[https://www.packagedfacts.com/Eating-Trends-Generational-Food-Shopping-12849696/]
, which surveyed 23,600 US adults, showed that interest in and
consumption of organic and natural foods are highly dependent on age
demographics and have less to do with income. In general, usage of
organic drops off at the '55 and over' age bracket, despite this
generation being more financially stable than younger generations.

In 2019, Spotify motivated more than half a million people worldwide to
create or have a podcast within its platform. By 2020, the streaming
service has a new goal: to be able to live or do podcast business for
both advertisers and content creators thanks to its new streaming ad
(SAI) service."We know that 63% of millennials and *generation Z* listen
to podcasts daily or at least once a week on average. The audience is
there, but what we need to solve is monetization for creators and show
advertisers the value of what they're paying for in an ad within a
podcast," said Dawn Ostroff head of Content at the global level.

According to the streaming firm, the current problem that advertisers
have with podcasts is that they lack data or the analysis of the actual
impact or scope of the ads they pay for within this type of content,
since it works as audio inserts instead specific moments of a
pre-recorded program.

In one of the startup's early days Rentomojo's CEO Geetansh Bamania was
out doing door-to-door sales of furniture while his parents waited
patiently at his home to wish him on his birthday.

Hustle was the mantra for the online furniture and appliance rental
startup from the beginning. In another instance, a corporate B2B
customer once returned 300 bean bags due to a lack of space at his
warehouse, and the Rentomojo team had to sell all of them in a day. They
went around Powai in Mumbai and knocked on virtually every door to sell
them off to youngsters.

“Unisex,” the industry’s buzzword and symbol for inclusion and
diversity, is now more mainstream thanks to brands casting male and
female models for their look books and designers casting a broader
spectrum of genders for their fashion shows. But with the advent of
unisex collections comes a myriad of questions. For one, what makes a
collection unisex? Also, where does it fit in a store or web site?

Few retailers, brands and designers are ready for this movement. Inhabit
launched its first genderless collection last fall, Norma Kamali changed
her storied brand to a unisex label last year, Umit Benan launched
unisex line B+ and Equipment is launching a gender-fluid collection in
spring 2020.

heard was a sector getting to grips with the environmental challenges
while creating packaging that delights consumers. They also heard that
the market had to connect with a new generation of drinkers – one that
is currently health conscious and not keen on drinking to excess.

New Delhi, Jan. 8 -- Short form video platforms like TikTok and the
stories mode on Snapchat, Instagram and Facebook have changed the way
people consume content on smartphones. Instead of the traditional
landscape mode, these platforms and modes are encouraging users to
create and view content in portrait mode.

Content in portrait mode works fine on smartphones, but when the same
content is played on TV, it fails to make the most of the screen and
disrupts the user experience with wide empty bars. "In smartphone we can
easily switch between vertical and horizontal modes. But when you play a
social media content from smartphone on a TV the experience isn't that
good," rues Jaipal Singh, associate research manager, Client Devices at IDC.

The Guardian’s new monthly column gathers all the ideas, trends and
other musical flotsam that slips through the cultural net. Share your
own thoughts on the month in music, and we’ll feature some next month

Pop and rock music, in its multifarious forms, seems to shift faster
than ever. In 2020, we’re bombarded not just with music – more of which
is readily available to everyone than at any point in history – but an
unrelenting barrage of the stuff that goes along with music: visuals,
scenes, theories, arguments, counter-arguments and controversies both
real and manufactured. It can feel overwhelming, impossible for even the
most plugged-in, social media-literate listener to keep up with. No
matter how much of the waterfront you try to cover, it’s hard to rid
yourself of the nagging sensation that you might have missed out on
something.

Do we need another version of this? Is there a reason for it to exist?

Those are the questions that come to mind whenever yet another reboot,
remake or revival comes along in TV or film. Is this new crack at
something old bringing anything to the table that we haven't seen
before? Is it doing justice to a story that may have already been told
perfectly well? Is it saying anything about the time we live in now?

PHILADELPHIA -- Teenagers searching for a sense of belonging don't have
to look much further than their cellphones. For both creators and
viewers, TikTok has become a platform where people can express isolating
feelings like loneliness, insecurities, and depression.

Teenagers have driven the popularity of TikTok, which launched
internationally in 2017 and allows users to share short looping videos,
between three and 60 seconds, often to songs or audio clips created by
others.

In light of the recent news that BP has set the target of creating five
unicorns by 2025 in an attempt to tackle the “dual challenge” of
providing more energy with fewer carbon dioxide emissions, rail and
energy recruitment specialist, Samuel Knight International, has urged
the energy giant to use this opportunity to attract more professionals
to the skill-short sector.

The oil and gas industry has historically battled with negative press
regarding climate change and also struggled to attract the number of
professionals needed due to outdated stereotypes, however as BP aims to
create new businesses which will address environmental issues, this can
be the ideal time to attract fresh new talent.

It is seen as the tech industry event of the year, and a window into the
inventions that will change our lives in the years ahead.

But the start of the CES conference in Las Vegas was dominated by a
robot that ferries toilet paper, a row over the appearance of Donald
Trump’s daughter Ivanka, and a decline in reported attendee numbers.

Building a retail space around the gender-free clothing concept was
until recently seen as financially risky. Now, Pew research has found
that 35 per cent of *Gen Z* knows someone who identifies as non-binary.
"I do believe gender-neutral fashion is the future," Fashion Institute
of Technology Professor Dawnn Karen said. Gender-free store The Phluid
Project in Manhattan was started by Rob Smith, 54, who spent 30 years as
a retail executive. "There is a paradigm shift happening in our society.
An unlearning and a relearning," he said. "*Gen-Z* (account) for
one-third of the national population, which accounts for 40 per cent of
U.S. spending power." Fifty-six per cent of *Gen Z* consumers already
shop outside of their gender, according to a study by ad agency J.
Walter Thompson.

Netflix's provocative hit show Sex Education is back, with female desire
top of its agenda, writes Eleanor Halls

When Sex Education first aired on Netflix in January last year, the
recurring word to describe the coming-of-age comedy drama was "surreal".
Created by then-unknown millennial writer Laurie Nunn, the show starred
Gillian Anderson as Jean Milburn, a free-spirited sex therapist,
alongside a bunch of first-time 20-something actors who play
15-year-olds navigating the perils of teenagedom in bucolic south Wales.

The young people of *generation Z* (born between the late 90s and early
2000s) are overtaking their predecessors, those of the Y (arrived in the
world between 1980 and 1990), in the sexual field, as revealed in the
"Young people and sex" elaborated barometer CONTROL.

What is counted in this report? The first thing is that there are things
that don't change. The bed remains the favorite place to practice sex
for millennials and for about 75% of the young people of the poshine
generation.

Climate crisis, Donald Trump, Brexit and Veganism - one wouldn't call
either of these a romantic topic, right? However, they have all emerged
as the top trending terms used by people around the world on dating apps
in 2019. In fact according to end-of-the-year stats released by several
dating apps in India and abroad, today, several people might swipe left
on you, not because your picture isn't hot enough, but because you might
not be right-wing, left-wing, vegan or environmentally-conscious enough
for them.

In a career spanning three decades, Grainne Allen has worked across all
the major pillars of the food industry. What began as a placement year
with Marks & Spencer turned into a full-time position as one of the
retailer’s first graduate product developers.

Since then, Allen has been involved in several major projects, from
pioneering healthy ready meals to rewriting the culinary strategy for
the Taste the Difference range at Sainsbury’s. In 2018, she joined
Whitbread as head of food and beverage, overseeing the menu development
at its 850 restaurants, from Brewers Fayre pubs to Bar + Block steakhouses.

Good morning! Yesterday, Pedro Sánchez was invested, after 284 days
since the Elections in April. We haven't broken the 2016 record—then it
was 315 days between the December elections and Mariano Rajoy's
inauguration at the end of October—but we remain one of the slowest
countries in government.

Bigger, prettier and better connected. TV manufacturers flaunted their
high-quality models to attract a generation accustomed to the Internet,
during the opening on Tuesday in La Vegas of the Consumer Electronics Show.

LG, Samsung, Sony and others announced the benefits of the new
ultra-high definition 8K displays, available on televisions over 65
inches, a segment that has grown rapidly in the market.

When we talk about the new generation in the workforce, we can
immediately think of millennials. However, the eldest is nearing 40
years of age.Today there is a new generation that has already made its
way into the workforce. *Generation Z* or "Centennials" are individuals
born between 1995 and 2010, and by 2020 they will account for a third of
the workforce.Many of the characteristics of the "Centennials" are far
from those that define millennials. They are pragmatic, lean even more
towards entrepreneurship and value social interaction. To attract them
to our organizations, we must begin by avoiding confusing them with
Millennials.We must study how they perceive the world of work,
understanding that they grew up in the midst of a global economic
recession, and job security is an element to which they attach great weight.

MILLIONS of Australians have kicked off the New Year with a mountain of
debt weighing them down.

According to new research from comparison site ­finder.com.au, 37 per
cent of us – the equivalent of 7.2 million people or one in three
Australians – have entered 2020 with a “Christmas debt hangover”.

*HD* 	TV Makers Moving to Streaming Platforms to Strengthen Ecosystems,
Says Parks

More than 70 percent of U.S. broadband households own at least one
streaming entertainment product and half own a smart TV, reported Parks
Associates Monday. Seventy-seven percent of smart TVs are connected to
the internet, it said, up from 62 percent in 2014. Manufacturers have
invested in improvements to the app and user experience on smart TVs,
resulting in higher connection rates, "which keeps the user within their
ecosystem," allowing opportunities to monetize the user base, said
analyst Kristen Hanich. That's increasingly important as manufacturers
and software providers look to extend into subscriptions and
ad-supported over-the-top video services. The analyst cited Samsung's
recently announced ad-supported video service, Samsung TV Plus, and said
more announcements from TV makers are expected at CES. Renewed focus on
app development and user experience is important for reaching
*Generation Z* users whose preference for content consumption is with
mobile devices, she said.

Meme lovers were surprised to see a familiar face on the American Music
Awards red carpet in November. Brittany Tomlinson — known as "Kombucha
Girl" after a TikTok video of her trying the drink was viewed by 40
million people on Twitter — stepped out in a custom-made black dress.
The 22-year-old Texas native with 2.3 million TikTok followers tweeted
"Dinner is served" about her first red carpet outing.

As more young stars turn to the Chinese-owned shortform video platform —
which now has an estimated 26.5 million monthly active U.S. users, 60
percent of them ages 16 to 24 — the fashion industry is discovering that
the next wave of style influencers might just be TikTok creators.

On a recent Saturday afternoon, I stood with my 13-year-old son in a
long line stretching over the West Side Highway, cars careening below
us. He was waiting to take an entrance exam for a specialized high
school, a sacred moment, and yet I kept glancing at my phone to check
the time. I had to meet my mother to tour an apartment because my
childhood home in the East Village had burned down the week prior—a
month after my father was diagnosed with late-stage lung cancer. My
parents, who are in their 70s, were too overwhelmed to handle the
logistics of finding a sublet on their own. On that day, and just about
every day these past few months, I had to choose between caring for one
family member or another. With so many crises under way, caring for
myself hasn’t really been on the table.

NEPTUNE, N. J. – Twelve New Jersey schools will begin piloting a new
LGBTQ-focused curriculum this month, the first wave of a requirement
that will soon be mandated across the state.

The pilot sites to be announced by the state Tuesday – including schools
in Hackensack, Morristown, Newark and Asbury Park – are intended to be
proving grounds for new lessons in history, economics and even grammar
designed to improve awareness of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender
contributions and issues. The instruction, approved by the state last
year, will be a requirement for all of New Jersey's public schools
starting in the fall.

When Swedish environmental advocate Greta Thunberg first stepped onto
American soil in late August after more than two weeks of travel, it
wasn’t on the carpeted floor of an airport. It was on the wooden dock of
a marina in Lower Manhattan.

Thunberg had sailed for 15 days from the U.K., pointedly choosing to
travel by water in keeping with Europe’s flight-shame movement, of which
she is a vocal proponent. And while the concept of flying less to help
combat climate change has yet to take off in the States, it’s also no
longer a distant possibility.

Welcome to the new decade with all of its challenges, but also some
bright opportunities. This decade will be characterized by both social
and global competitive shifts and could be defined as the “fork in the
road” for many businesses, industries, and economies. The following are
just a few of the questions, perspectives, and observations to consider
when conducting short and long run planning and strategy sessions.

Will consumer trends, driven by the millennials, *Generation Z*, and
Generation A, continue to shift rapidly? Plant-based and cultured meat
have established a place in the market. Will these alternative products
cut into the demand for more traditional products? Will individual
producers and industry leadership groups develop a game plan to align
with consumer desires? Or, will they be satisfied to be the low-cost
commodity producer for the U.S. and global markets?

Patty Morrissey, Chief Organizing Expert at Mercari, Shares Her Secret to Getting Organized in the New Year 
 

NEW YORK, Jan. 7, 2020 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Getting organized,
simplifying life and having a smaller footprint on the environment were
the top New Year's resolutions in a recent nationwide survey by Mercari,
a popular resale marketplace app. They found that most Americans believe
they could pocket $723 just by selling stuff they don't use, and the
average American household has 42 items they don't use. In fact, nearly
20% of women still have unused holiday gifts in their homes from 2018!
Recently, Patty Morrissey, Chief Organizing Expert at Mercari, teamed
with YourUpdateTV to discuss the results of the survey and share her
secrets to getting organized in the New Year.

Augmented-reality software that makes you actually want to work out. A
device that prints real-ish temporary tattoos in seconds. A TV screen
that rotates like your smartphone. And a robot that just wants to be loved.

These were among the coolest gizmos and gadgets that caught our
collective eyes in the early hours of CES, though to the chagrin of at
least some of the companies behind these disparate dazzlers, what we saw
in Vegas may stay in Vegas. Translation: With few exceptions, you'll
likely never get to buy any of these things.

As the artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem in Canada continues to
mature and expand, the country is implementing various approaches to
attract and retain skilled tech talents.

For instance, in June 2017, the country launched the Global Team Stream,
a program that speeds up the visa application of skilled tech workers.
The visa processing time is reduced from 10 months to two weeks for
applicants with IT and STEM-related background.

Artistes like Naezy, Knox Artiste, Prabh Deep and Ritviz are singing
with brands. Unlike jingle-like brief ad copies, these associations lead
to complete music videos designed to be hummable, shareable and to be a
part of playlists.The 2019 production Gully Boy, a feature film about
the underground Indian rap scene helped zoom in on the 'others' in the
Indian music scene. This supernova, the shock wave of which rippled
through digital mediums, created lots of smaller instant stars. It's not
that they hadn't worked hard for it but suddenly, they achieved a
significant amount of the mainstream limelight. And brands like
limelight.Branded music videos used to be the refuge for alcobev brands
that are barred from going la-la-la across mediums of mass outreach.
Today, brands across segments are taking to such videos for ads. These
ads feature smaller non-mainstream stars who have a decent digital
presence, which at times might seem bigger than mainstream faces as well.

WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The
Wall Street Journal (January 7, 2020).

The midlife crisis has long belonged to men. The revelation that life is
finite is apparently so startling to 40- and 50-something males that
many behave badly, often by trading in their wives and cars for flashier
models with more curb appeal. But as Ada Calhoun writes in "Why We Can't
Sleep," middle-aged women are busily closing this angst gap. Squeezed by
aging parents and young children, plagued by rising housing costs and
declining job stability, ever more American women are waking up in the
middle of the night to ask themselves, "Where did I go wrong?"

KUALA LUMPUR: There is a need for increased investment awareness and
education among the Indian community as most of them are unfamiliar
about it and fear failure due to mere hearsay. “ArkWorld Asia is
developing strategies and plans to engage the marginal community in
support of continuous awareness and education of capital market and
financial management to strike the equilibrium that is being aspired,”
said ArkWorld Asia PLT managing partner Venothini Sritharan. “Such
awareness programmes, and followed by education, are tailored to *Gen-Z*
to support progressive equity participation of Malaysia Indians,” she
told the New Straits Times. ArkWorld Asia, a market leader on investment
education, employs investment strategies that are being used by
successful investors globally, including Benjamin Graham, Warren Buffet,
Joel Greenblatt and Prem Watsa.

India, Jan. 7 -- It has been a significant year for us, where India
continues to improve on the World Bank's ease of doing business index
and position itself as the world's second-fastest-growing economy, after
China. India is expected to be one of the top three economic powers of
the world over the next 10-15 years.

It has retained its position as the third-largest startup base in the
world with over 4,750 technology startups, according to a report by
NASSCOM. Such a fast-changing business environment and constant
developments in technology makes it imperative for us to constantly
upskill ourselves to stay ahead of the curve.

A Yungblud show should come with a disclaimer - "must be 25 or younger

has brought him a dedicated global following, with Sydney no exception.

"Being a feminist isn't just a women's thing," mused Nigerian Chimamanda
Ngozi Aidichieen at her 2012 TED conference. Feminist is not born, made
and, in the same way, masculinity is built. From the force that the
movement gained in recent years comes the questioning towards males
about the need for new masculinities, that need to deconstruct to build
a true cultural transformation.

The controversial photo of Cordoba Tomás Vidal, ex-graduate of
International Trade at the 21st Century University, disguised as a dead
girl inside a plastic bag, put into focus the need to educate in
equality to break once and for all with culture engrossed patriarchal,
visible from the most egregious acts to the usual practices we naturalize.

Samsung unveiled its new QLED TV with 8K resolution that integrates
quantum dots to generate better image quality. But that's not all: this
model stands out for having almost no frames on its "infinite" screen.

(Custom)This TV uses 99% of the front and the only bezel it has is just
2.3 millimetres. It is that the equipment itself is ultra thin, at just
15 millimeters thick. This continues to deepen the trend of generating
minimalist equipment, which integrates into the environment more naturally.

What's new for business is old in2020

The top business trend for 2020 is going to feel like a throwback. In
2018 and 2019, growth and innovation dominated the topics at the top of
every executive's news feeds. In many respects, reviewing what thought
leaders were predicting in those years reads like a who's who of the
roaring 2010s - artificial intelligence leading customer experiences
(Gartner 2018), the entry of *Gen Z* into the workforce (Forbes 2018),
growth through marketing or new business models (Inc 2018) data-driven
personalization (Inc 2019). It's what eve^one was talking about, it was
all new and exciting, and in retrospect, some of these trends were
inevitable while others fell flat.

For the roughly 17,000 truckers who transport goods in and out of the
Los Angeles and Long Beach ports, 2020 brings much uncertainty.

Assembly Bill 5, the gig worker rule that became law on Jan. 1, mandates
that certain contract workers in California be classified as employees.
It excludes some professions --doctors, lawyers, hairstylists and others
--while contractors who drive under the trucking companies' permits and
get paid by the load are likely subject to the new rule.

Israeli creativity has launched some 7,000 start-ups and attracted some
350 global companies to establish R&D centers in Israel. All are driven
by profit. This is understandable. Profit is to start-ups what oxygen is
to living things.

But in the meantime, Israel has huge social problems. In the absence of
adequate resources and in the face of deficit-ridden government budgets,
these problems have to be tackled with creative ideas. In practice they
are not. Overcrowded hospitals, low-achieving schools, a pension and
national insurance system headed for bankruptcy, a dysfunctional
political system, billionaires enjoying tax breaks together with too
many poor families - those are just a few of the social challenges.

There’s more to jeans than classic blue.

The past few seasons have seen an onslaught of deconstructed styles,
color blocked denim and embellished jeans, all with the intention to
give consumers new reasons to buy. This winter denim brands are
responding with bold updates of classic patterns like animal prints,
camouflage and tie-dye.

Welcome to the start of a new year at work, where unemployment remains
low and employees — in theory — have leverage to call the shots. Yet the
state of the American workplace is less than ideal. Workers say they
feel shortchanged, commutes are more stressful, burnout is real and more
are planning to jump ship. “Companies are having to get more creative
because there’s so much demand for better pay and better benefits,” said
Elizabeth Hang, a Minneapolis-based workplace expert at the staffing
firm Robert Half International. In the span of a decade, the labor
market has swung from deep recession and layoffs where businesses called
the shots to what now is decidedly a candidate’s market. More workers
are scrutinizing their salary and benefits — and assessing their
satisfaction, according to several surveys conducted during the year by
Robert Half. This itch to switch has employers concerned about holding
on to top talent.

barrier[https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/education-would-help-millennial-homebuyers-take-advantage-of-low-rates]
to homeownership for younger consumers and Freddie Mac is trying to
change that.

The government-sponsored enterprise on Monday launched CreditSmart
Homebuyer U — a free, comprehensive online resource to walk people
through the homebuying cycle. Freddie Mac broke out the course into six
learning modules, spanning everything from saving, to securing a loan,
to purchasing a house andhomeownership preservation.
