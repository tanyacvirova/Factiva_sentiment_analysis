(PRWeb) - Buildertrend, the leading provider of cloud-based project
management software for homebuilders, remodelers and specialty
contractors, today released its 2020 Digitally Savvy Homeowners Report,
which uncovers key factors homeowners consider when choosing to work
with residential construction businesses.

*Gen Z* and Millennials arent the only ones demanding more digital
experiences in their lives. More Generation X and Baby Boomer consumers
now expect digital experiences in every aspect of their lives as well
including when building or renovating their homes. Despite overwhelming
evidence that seamless omni-channel experiences are critical for modern
business operations, the construction industry which is widely
considered one of the least digitized industries has failed to evolve in
pace with digital market advancement. And instead, its remained heavily
dependent on manual and paper-based processes.

How are your personal finances doing? How much have they changed over
the past 10 years?

Overall, average income hasn't increased much over the past decade,
while home values in many parts of the country have soared. Consumers
are carrying the most credit card debt ever, and student loan debt has
been growing dramatically, especially for borrowers in their 50s and 60s.

*HD* 	Survey reveals surprising results - if you're selling to
*generation z*, pick up the phone!

A recent survey of British shoppers has found that a majority of people
prefer to talk on the phone rather than go online to get more
information about complex purchases. Perhaps most surprising of all,
more 16-24 year olds (32%) prefer to pick up the phone to discuss a
purchase than 35-44 year olds (24%). This suggests a trend away from
online communication and towards phone interaction, surprisingly led by
*Generation Z*.

The survey, carried out by Mediahawk, asked 2,000 people of all ages
across the UK about purchasing habits and preferred means of seeking
information about intended purchases. One of the key findings was that
60% of respondents want the option to speak to someone on the phone if
they need to discuss complex, personal or expensive purchases, with less
than 10% disagreeing. Furthermore, 45% of respondents find it quicker to
call a company to discuss something in more detail, with only 15% taking
the opposite view.

True Detective meets Swamp Thing in the Artemis Fowl author’s
neo-noirish thriller about a curmudgeonly dragon in Louisiana

Irish author Eoin Colfer[https://www.theguardian.com/profile/eoincolfer]
mined the tropes of contemporary fantasy in his bestselling Artemis
Fowl[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/24/fiction-older-children-reviews-artemis-fowl]
children’s books about a tweenage criminal mastermind facing off against
pixies, fairies and trolls. Those adventures straddled the fantasy,
science fiction and spy thriller genres to fun effect; in his first
adult fantasy novel, Colfer takes on dragons. Highfire is a briskly
entertaining outing centred on the curmudgeonly and slobbish Vern, last
of the fire-breathing beasts of folklore.

tout these policies that reduce human interaction for a generation
that's struggling with isolation?

Two people look at the same screen. They're separated by just a metre.
They do not wear special glasses or augmented reality helmets. But they
see different messages on the monitor. One observes a landscape with the
Eiffel Tower on which it says "Paris". Another, a skyline of skyscrapers
in which "Seoul" is read. They are at CES, the world's largest consumer
technology fair, making a parallel reality demo. This technology,
developed by Misapplied Sciences, allows different users to view
different and personalized messages on the same monitor.

"It consists of displaying pixels that are able to simultaneously cast
beams of light of different colors in many directions at once. We can
make a pixel look red there, green there," explains Dave Thompson, Delta
airline employee in Atlanta, pointing to different areas of a room. Your
company will be testing this technology in 2020 at the Detroit
Metropolitan Airport (USA).

As the menswear shows end, were luxury labels championing liberal values
or looking to capture woke *Gen Z* consumers?

Entering a new decade, designers in Paris were thinking deeply about
modern masculinity — and how that might translate to clothes. If a few
lone voices in Milan posited questions about the future of the male —
Miuccia Prada, Alessandro Michele — the majority were content to suit
him, boot him and shove him in a swaggering, molto-machismo
wide-shouldered coat (the single most consistently evident item from the
forthcoming season). But in Paris, musings on ideas of identity came
thick and fast.

In 2020, five people will enter the growing global middle class every
second, reinforcing the secular, long-term appeal of discretionary
consumer spending, and consequently, the luxury sector.

But alongside the wave of new consumers entering into the category,
shifting demographics is imbuing younger consumers with new spending
power across a broadening range of luxury categories.

The theme songs of the James Bond film franchise form a curious and
bewitching sub-genre unique in pop music, writes Martyn McLaughlin.

If the producers of the James Bond films live in a constant state of
anxiety that their franchise is in danger of slipping its moorings as a
cultural phenomenon, they must be reassured by the clenching of teeth
and clatter of keystrokes that has greeted their choice to write and
perform the next instalment's theme song.

Segmenting young consumers into groups based on age, gender and race is
not the way for brands and retailers to reach them, according to a new
study.

Compiled by PSFK, a brand and retail research firm and consultancy, and
Complex Networks, the Hearst-owned media brand, the study found overall
that the younger generation of consumers no longer identifies with the
segments used by marketers for decades. Likely influenced by the number
of major celebrities that have found success in several different
business ventures and creative moves (think Rihanna, Donald Glover,
Billie Eilish, Virgil Abloh, etc.) Millennial and *Gen Z* consumers look
at themselves and no longer see age or race or religious affiliation.
Rather they see a compilation of creative and social interests and want
to buy from brands that meet their personal ideals.

In a luxury building near the South Williamsburg waterfront, there’s an
immaculately designed three-bedroom, three-and-a-half bath penthouse
that rents for $15,000 a month. The master bathroom is outfitted with a
cozy soaking tub and Gucci wallpaper, complemented by natural light
flooding in from the floor-to-ceiling windows in the master bedroom.
There’s a prop closet nearby filled with coffee table books, magazines,
throw pillows and decorative objects that can be swapped in and out of
each room — roughly $40,000 worth of decorations. Though no one lives
here, the home will have a steady stream of influencers and celebrities
coming in and out through a private entrance (with a private elevator)
almost every day of the week.

TORONTO — Shares of Spin Master Corp. fell Tuesday after it said sales
were going to be worse than expected because of problems with its
distribution system, a softer U.S. market, and fallout from trade disputes.

The Toronto-based toy giant says results for its fourth quarter and 2019
as a whole would likely show a one per cent drop in gross product sales,
compared with its guidance in November of growth in the low single digits.

NEW YORK (AP) — Today she travels the world, attends premieres and
participates in talks with astronauts, former presidents and notable
feminists.

But in the years after the September 11, 2001, attacks, Amani
Al-Khatahtbeth was just a New Jersey girl like so many, writing a blog
from her room. He used the blog to contact other young Muslimwomen and
to combat stereotypes. Back then, the only media-like images were in
prison costumes similar to their father and women who seemed mute and
oppressed, she said.

(Bloomberg) -- Al Gore stood on stage in November at a private club in
San Francisco to deliver his familiar spiel on climate change. His
audience: 100 rich heirs from around the world.

“This is the most serious crisis humanity has faced,” the former U.S.
vice president said, imploring the young people in the room to devote
their resources to saving the planet. “The leadership you provide in
your families can make all the difference in how capital is allocated.”

Fashion 4 Development is partnering with the Altru Institute to play up
the importance of making sustainability fashionable, by scaling the most
promising technological advances, creating a more circular supply chain
and inspiring new initiatives for collective change. An inaugural dinner
honoring the United Nations’ former director-general Michael Møller was
planned for Monday night for the start of Altru’s weeklong Winter Summit
in Davos, Switzerland. Marcel Skibba, head chef at IGNIV by Andreas
Caminada at the Badrutt’s Palace Hotel, was tasked with the evening’s menu.

A “Ladies Who Inspire Luncheon” will be held today for the group’s
“Agents of Change” in sustainability who are also gathering for
presentations about the latest technology, panel discussions and
fireside chats. F4D Solutions’ managing director Jeanine Ballone planned
to address how to reimagine supply chains to save water, protect
forestry, reduce pollution and try to eliminate plastics.

Both Sony, Samsung and LG presented the screens they will compete with

the battlehorse in terms of innovation will be the resolution 8K.

Greta Thunberg is not just helping to save the planet - she is reshaping
the global investment industry, says the boss of one of the world’s
largest independent financial advisory organisations.

The comments from Nigel Green, the chief executive and founder of deVere
Group, which operates in 100 countries worldwide, come as the
high-profile young Swedish environmental activist urged political and
business leaders and the media at the World Economic Forum in Davos to
heed the science as she warned time was running out to tackle global
warming.

Before the social media age, tech-savvy celebrities kept in touch with
their fans via clunky official websites. And then they just left them
there, finds Susannah Goldsbrough

“Ian Murray
McKellen[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/theatre/what-to-see/warmth-wit-wizardry-ian-mckellen-80/]
was born at 20.30 Greenwich Mean Time, on 25 May 1939.” So reads the
first line of the admirably precise “Pre-website Biography (to 1998)”
section of the acclaimed British actor’s official website,
mckellen.com[http://www.mckellen.com/], which for the last 20 years has
been gathering dust in a quiet corner of the internet.

As retail analysts and industry consultants digest recent holiday sales
that were mixed and, in many cases, disappointing, they note that 2020
will likely be more volatile from a consumer spending perspective.

In several recent reports and interviews with WWD, analysts and
consultants said the retail environment will be impacted by changing
economic and geopolitical forces as well as demographic shifts — notably
the spending behavior of maturing Millennials, who shun large purchases
and are continuing to be weighed down by student debt. With fashion
apparel, analysts see the “mainstreaming” of the resale and rental
segments as having the greatest impact.

Givaudan Active Beauty has developed face mask formulas that it says tap
into the specific needs of *Generation Z* – a rising demographic that
associate beauty with confidence, self-expression and naturalness.

The naturally coloured ‘Sensory Crush’ masks took around six months to
develop and come in three different formulas: an exfoliating blend made
with natural papaya extract; a night blend with natural yuzu extract;
and a restorative blend with natural dragon fruit. Givaudan Active
Beauty presented them last week at Cosmet’Agora in Paris.

Washington D.C., Jan. 21 -- : Millennials are lethargic when it comes to
cleaning bathrooms, revealed a recent survey.

According to the poll conducted by Mulberrys Garment Care about regular
house chores, people with their birth dates post 1981 cleaned their
house's washrooms most commonly once in a month or so. Whereas, the same
happened with only 10 per cent of the baby boomer or the next generation.

Business models, the nature of work and the composition of workforces
are changing radically. Only companies that transform continuously will
remain competitive. Successful transformation depends crucially on
whether an organization’s leaders have the right mindset and skills.

For companies in the midst of digital transformation, the ability to
adapt is the single most important skill, according to a 2016 Harvard
Business Review article. Adaptation has to start with people. New roles
emerge and old roles evolve; others that have existed for decades are
disappearing. Companies need to be able to develop and cultivate new,
digitally integrated skills.

The trucking industry is facing technological and business headwinds

One offering can convince food service customers to come in the door,
switch from a competitor, or give a second chance.

According to the 2020 Restaurant Marketing Insights guide from online
discount platform RetailMeNot, 85% of surveyed consumers say a deal or
discount influences where they choose to eat outside of their homes, and
81% say a deal would make them likely to switch restaurants they planned
to dine at.

Who your customers are may factor into sustainability decisions.

According to “The State of Consumer Spending: *Gen Z* Shoppers Demand
Sustainable Retail,” a new survey from digital testing platform First
Insight, 62% of *Gen Z* respondents prefer to buy from sustainable
brands, on par with millennials, while 54% of Gen X and 44% of the
Silent Generation (born 1928-45) said the same. However, only 39 percent
of baby boomers agreed.

Why does anyone have a Twitter account? Moreover, why does any thing—a
band, a brand, a government agency—have one? The ­President might tweet
us all into World War III, but at least he’s a person. Less immediately
menacing, but equally surreal, are the occasions when the C.I.A. wishes
the nation a “Happy #NationalCakeDay!,” or Chick-fil-A picks a fight
with Popeyes.

The 2010s brought serious reality checks to once-favored technology
startups in healthcare. But despite some major blowups, health system
and venture-capital leaders say they generally aren't spooked about the
startup scene.

A major reason why is that startups, while often new entrants to a
field, have in the past disrupted industries—something healthcare
needs—making investors a lot of money in the process. That's part of the
incentive for Partners HealthCare in Boston, which since 2008 has opened
multiple investment funds that have attracted millions of dollars.
Partners' most recent effort, launched last October, is a $30 million
fund dedicated to artificial intelligence and digital technologies.

Huntington Beach Chrysler-Dodge-Jeep-Ram wanted to make waves when the
U.S. Open of Surfing came to town last summer.

The Southern California dealership's ad team, TurnKey Marketing, decided
to get in on the action via Snapchat, the growing messaging app that has
a foothold among the industry's youngest customers.

New Delhi, Jan. 20 -- Whenever there was a dip in employee engagement
and workers complained they had no direct connect with the Big Boss, the
CEO of a company I worked with would ask me: "Hema, in spite of the
largeness of the community, each of Mr Spiritual Leader's followers
thinks s/he has a direct connect to him. Why can't we replicate that
feeling here?"

A decade or two ago this was indeed a tough task. But now when I am
asked this question, I immediately respond, "Of course, we can engage to
the size of one." The powerful twins of technology and analytics have
made it possible to address the each individual employee across their
life-cycle with the company.

It's official: *Generation Z* women are now entering motherhood. This
may shock some marketing professionals who are still perplexed over the
behaviors of the Millennial Mom, and this is certainly not intended to
make anyone feel old.

The reality is that generations span 20 years — and yes, we've been
discussing Millennials for two decades. *Generation Z* spans births from
1996 to 2010, making the oldest women 24 years old. This is just two
years short of 26, the average age for first-time mothers in the United
States.

Sustainability and reducing the ecological impact of their operations is
one of the main concerns of department store and self-service chains. In
fact, he was one of the main players in the annual convention of the
National Retail Federation (NRF, equivalent to Mexico's ANTAD in the
United States).The concept is closely related to business continuity,
initiatives for the business to thrive or even exist in the long term
That's why it touches on areas such as the environment, the impact on
the community, collaborators, suppliers or privacy issues.

Customers are demanding that sustainability be in the strategy.
According to firstinsight consultancy, 62% of millennial consumers

The evolution of plant-based snacks is on the rise and will go beyond
soy and nut proteins to pea, mung bean, watermelon seed and hempseed flours.

These are the findings of university food service, accommodation and
facilities management company Sodexco, which has released its top
snacking trends for 2020.

Restaurant and Reynolds hosted a discussion on the rise of plant-based
cuisine and how the industry is evolving to cater for customers who want
to eat fewer animal products

Less than half of *Gen Z* (18 to 21-year-olds) describe themselves as
meat-eaters. That should be an extremely sobering piece of information
for restaurants with menus heavily focused on meat and fish. Conducted
on behalf of fruit and vegetable-specialist Reynolds, the research into
consumer eating habits also reveals that 44% of all those surveyed plan
to eat more plant-based dishes in 2020.

was again able to generate well over 100k downloads from Nigeria and
rewarded all users that downloaded the App or invited their friends with
free data across all mobile operators. Flaim is not a newcomer to
Nigeria, they had already done an initial launch in May 2019, when they
were able to generate well over 200,000 downloads from Nigeria with a
data gifting strategy, and quickly rose to the top rankings on Google Play.

For those attending CES 2020 last week, there was a whiff of
disappointment in the air that there weren't enough breakthrough
"things," and the existing technologies were in the process of evolving
rather than disrupting.

As a volunteer floor guide for CES at Tech West and Eureka Park, I heard
this firsthand from clients, but for me the story this year was about
the foundational technologies, 5G, Wifi 6, biometrics, AI and voice
assistance, and how smart combinations of existing technologies are
pushing the envelope.

Features | Rid your beauty regime of animal-derived products with vegan
shampoos and conditioners, writes Jess Denham

Veganuary, the month where many of us go vegan for environmental and
health benefits, is in full swing. But vegans don’t only avoid eating
food with animal-derived ingredients, they steer clear of clothes and
beauty products that contain them, too.

As 2020 gets going, it's worth looking back at another year in which
home sellers did well in some markets, but often at the expense of home
buyers.

First, in much of the country, home prices rose again in 2019. According
to the November Zillow Real Estate Market Report, home values grew an
average of 3.8 percent, and the median home value in the United States
is $243,225. The median list price per square foot in the United States
is $154. The median price of homes currently listed in the United States
is $284,999, while the median price of homes that sold is $236,900. The
median rent price in the United States is $1,650.

NEW YORK -- Zachariah Mohammed's living room is filled with stuff he
doesn't own.

He pays $260 a month for the sofa, side table, bar cart, dining table
and four chairs in his living room. It's worth it, the 27-year-old New
Yorker says. If he needs to move, which he's done twice in the last 12
months, he won't need to lug a sofa across the city or worry if it will
fit in a new place. The furniture-rental startup, Feather, will swap out
items for something else.

Often touted as the world's last great untapped market, the Muslim
travel sector is gaining prominence in the tourism industry, with
distinct patterns and trends coming to the fore as the segment swells in
numbers.

In 2018, the global Muslim travel population clocked at 140 million,
according to the Mastercard-CrescentRating Global Muslim Travel Index
2019. The index projected that by 2026, this figure will surge 64 per
cent to reach 230 million.

Rents are hitting a record high, but millennials, the self-dubbed
'Generation
Rent[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/buy/number-young-homeowners-will-halve-2026-four-ways-make-sure/]',
are now paying less of it.

This age cohort (those born between 1977 and 1995) paid £37.3 billion in
rent last year, which is around £1 billion less than what they spent in
2017, new data from Hamptons International have shown.

I am a member of the Silent Generation. What's that, you ask? The other
generations get noticed " the Greatest Generation, the baby boomers, the
Gen Xers, the millennials. People haven't heard of us. Maybe it's the name.

Americans often talk about the story of our country in terms of
generations, but I don't recall that ever coming up in my favorite high
school course, U.S. history. I offer my unsung age cohort and its
political failures as a small addition to the next round of textbooks.

There are only a few hours left before Christmas Eve, but Amandin
Ohayon, CEO of Pronovias, has to serve an American media outlet after
chatting over the phone with this newspaper. If these dates are usually
busy in a company that, although recognized for its wedding dresses, is
also a specialist in party costumes, this year surpasses the usual
trajín: Pronovias opened boutique in Beverly Hills on December 30.

During the summer season of radio, I did a session on Radio National
talking about “Millennial and *Gen Z* speak”, the new “language” of the
young that those of us born “a while ago” find puzzling and sometimes
confronting. Since then I’ve been receiving a steady flow of emails
requesting information as people missed part of the chat.

Well, buckle up folks because some of the language is just odd, while
some is rude and other parts a bit confronting. Let’s first define
“Millenial” and a “*Gen Z*” people shall we? Authorities agree that
Millennials were born in the period 1981–1996 inclusive.

About 64 per cent of India’s *Gen Z*/GenY, who already have a vehicle,
are now questioning the need to own a vehicle as opposed to 51 per cent
in 2019, according to Deloitte’s 2020 Global Automotive Consumer Study.

The respondents (all of them vehicleowners) cited an increase in the
cost of owning a personal vehicle, emergence of Bharat Stage-VI emission
standards, coupled with higher penetration of ride-hailing services, as
the reason for the same.
