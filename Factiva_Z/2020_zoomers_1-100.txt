Before the coronavirus, there was something I used to worry about. It
was called screen time. Perhaps you remember it.

I thought about it. I wrote about
it[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/23/sunday-review/human-contact-luxury-screens.html].

I would try different digital detoxes as if they were fad diets, each
working for a week or two before I’d be back on that smooth glowing glass.

“Our house is still on fire. Your inaction is fuelling the flames by the
hour.”

This year, the World Economic Forum (Wef20) brought together global
leaders to address many world issues at the Annual Meeting in Davos, the
top-most spoken about being the ecological crisis of our time. The theme
of the forum this year was “Stakeholders for a Cohesive and Sustainable
World.”

In times of market turmoil, one group of stocks that investors can count
on to deliver reliable income growth is the Dividend Aristocrats: an
elite group of companies that have produced at least 25 consecutive
years of dividend hikes.

During the 2010s, these high-quality stocks returned an average of
14.75% per year, besting the S&P 500 by 1.2 percentage points. A big
reason for the Dividend Aristocrats' outperformance, especially over the
long term, is the high dividend component of their returns.

SAN MATEO, Calif., March 31, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- A new national survey
from Swytchback, a leader in mobile visual surveys, found that nearly a
quarter (23%) of *Gen Z* and Millennial respondents consider COVID-19
not at all serious, not very serious or mildly serious, and only about
half (51%) consider it very serious. The survey of more than 20,000 men
and women between the ages of 16 to 30 years old examines young people's
perceptions of and knowledge about COVID-19, and identifies areas for
improved communication and education to help prevent its spread. The
survey was conducted in partnership with Tap Research.

The findings show that many Gen Zers and Millennials continue to have
significant knowledge gaps concerning the coronavirus pandemic. Other
topline findings from the survey include:

personal use. According to a new report from App Annie, out on Monday,
business conferencing apps have been experiencing record growth as a
result, and just hit their biggest week ever in March, when they topped
62 million downloads during the week of March 14-21. Meanwhile, social
networking video app Houseparty has also seen phenomenal growth in
Europe during lockdowns and home quarantines.

After the financial crash, Britain’s young shouldered the burden. The
Conservatives must not let that happen again

The kids are boomeranging back again. Up and down the country, overgrown
children are shuffling home to roost, refugees from a virus that has
stalled their adult lives mid-launch. University lectures and
supervisions have all been moved online, so there’s no point student
children moping around deserted halls when they could be home ransacking
the parental
fridge[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/going-home-puts-my-parents-at-risk-students-hit-by-coronavirus-upheaval].
Gap years too are ending abruptly in a mad scrabble for the last flight
out. And for those losing wobbly first jobs in the early wave of
coronavirus redundancies, from bar and shop workers to freelancers whose
commissions have dried up overnight, home is the refuge of last resort.
But now what?

Women involvement in oil and gas sector was the subject of a very rich
debate by prominent global energy leaders and stakeholders, whogathered
in five panels on the third day of the Egypt Petroleum Show (EGYPS 2020)
to address the challenges the industry faces in achieving gender parity
and inclusion. Creating a long-term forecast, strategy, and action plan
to foster a sustainable, equitable, and inclusive industry of the future
were targets of several renowned experts who took part in the debates.

*Gen Z*-ers, who have long been leading marketers on a merry chase, seem
to have given branding experts the slip again.

For more than a year, pundits have painted these kids as a fast-building
wave of activism, virtually unreachable through traditional media. The
only way brands could reach them, the thinking went, was to build a
bridge to their passions through cause marketing.

VANCOUVER—First, the boomers criticized millennials, then the
millennials struck back at boomers. Now, they're both here for *Gen Z*.

Millennials were once branded as entitled brats who couldn't afford
homes because they dined out on avocado toast. Then the tables turned
and the concerns of aging boomers were dismissed with the flippant “OK
Boomer” meme.

We are experiencing a massive shift in how people are consuming video
content on their televisions. The number of homes with paid TV service
(cable or satellite) peaked in 2014 at 100.5 million. According to
eMarketer, this number will decline 20 percent by the end of 2020 as
viewers decide to “cut the cord,” the term used to describe canceling
paid TV subscriptions in favor of streaming services.

This trend of cord cutting will continue. In my experience, people are
excited to cancel their cable and satellite subscriptions. It seems
consistently increasing rates on loyal customers while offering huge
savings to new subscribers creates animosity. Who would have guessed?

A slew of evangelical churches and their parishioners in the southern
U.S. defied orders to stay home. They wept. They prayed. They wept. And
they prayed.

At the Life Tabernacle Church in Baton Rouge, La., preacher Tony Spell,
according to the Los Angeles Times, "jumped into the pews, paraded,
hugged and laid hands on worshipers' foreheads."

FMCG brands may weather the storm better as sales of food, drink,
hygiene products boom on Amazon and Tmall. In India, 55% shoppers are
going online, 50% in China, 31% Italy, 23% in the US and 18% in the UK

WARC, the international marketing intelligence service, has found that
the global economy is set to fall into recession, with the advertising
market likely to follow in the first half of this year, though FMCG
brands are better-placed to weather the storm.

Deprived of face-to-face contact, the over-65s are turning to video
chat-often for the first time-to keep up to date with loved ones

Geoffrey Brook was deeply apprehensive when he heard that his fellow
over-70s were being asked to remain indoors to protect them from the new
coronavirus[http://telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/coronavirus-news-covid-19-latest-cases-uk-lockdown-nhs-deaths/].
His wife, Mary, died shortly before Christmas, leaving him alone at his
home in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, and the prospect of several months
with no visitors was not an attractive one.

We asked consumers about their experiences with large-scale projections,
interactive displays, holograms, virtual and augmented reality.

The findings highlighted a significant societal shift in consumer
attitudes with demand for immersive experiences at events, visitor
attractions and retail stores in Europe on the rise. This is
particularly the case among young event-goers, and millennials are the
most likely to have participated in an experiential event.

Known for its short-video dance crazes that have become a *Gen-Z*
obsession, TikTok is pushing heavily into livestreaming during the U.S.
coronavirus quarantines.

Between March 23 and 27, the app’s first-ever livestream series featured
a wide range of celebrities including Alicia Keys, Arnold Schwarzenegger
and Dr. Phil, as well as top TikTok stars like Charli D’Amelio. Called
#HappyAtHome, the program was created by TikTok to entertain users
practicing social distancing. It was launched at a time when
livestreaming has skyrocketed on social
media;[https://www.glossy.co/beauty/instagram-livestreams-surge-in-social-distancing-era] quarantine

In order to promote health and safety guidelines in the wake of the
novel coronavirus, Freeform is launching a multi-platform social
distancing campaign called #StayTheFFHome, Variety has learned exclusively.

The goal of #StayTheFFHome is to encourage the Freeform audience to take
state officials’ “safer at home” and “shelter in place” advisories
seriously. To further entice young adults to hunker down wherever they
dwell, Freeform has put together a special programming lineup to give
them something to binge and will be running special PSAs on-air and
across social media in which talent from the network’s shows talks about
the importance of social distancing and flattening the curve.
Additionally, Freeform will be branding billboards and other outdoor
posters with the logo for the campaign.

*HD* 	As the U.S. shuts down, StockX’s business is booming, says its CEO

StockX, the high-flying resale marketplace that connects buyers and
sellers of sneakers, streetwear, handbags and other collectible items,
has seen its fortune rise along with the $6 billion global sneaker
resale market, which is part of the broader $100 billion sneaker
category. In fact, the company, which was assigned a billion-dollar-plus
valuation last year, says $1 billion worth of merchandise was sold
through its platform last year.

The big question is whether StockX can maintain its momentum. Not only
are other rivals biting at the heels of the five-year-old, Detroit-based
outfit, which has raised roughly $160 million from investors, but some
believe the streetwear “bubble” is on the verge of bursting. Add to the
mix a pandemic that’s putting millions of people out of work (and in
some cases jeopardizing the health of those still showing up), and you
might assume that answer is no.

There have been a number of articles on how Covid-19 has spread so fast
and far because of people. And I fail to understand why some section of
people continue to behave irrationally.

Millennials, for instance, are still going to the beach or are out
partying with groups of friends. Why such brazenness in behaviour?
Millennials and the *generation Z* have been pampered. A majority of
them haven't had to bother about the challenges in life as parents took
good care of them. The sad reality now is that they may be giving their
parents a fatal illness.

The COVID-19 pandemic has forced people to stay home and self-isolate,
but once it is safe to emerge Canada could see a newfound kindness and
compassion in society and consumer culture.

A study by Anstice, a research and marketing communications consultancy
in Calgary, found that 67 per cent of 800 respondents ranked the basics
of life - health, family and friends - as the most important things.

The story recurs in nearly every mythological system: Agamemnon
sacrificed his daughter Iphigenia to guarantee good winds to sail to the
battle of Troy; human sacrifice was an integral part of Aztec religious
rituals; Christians hold that Jesus of Nazareth died for the sins of all
mankind. In each case, we see the hallmarks of religious sacrifice: Give
up the lives of a few to rebalance society.

Enter Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick (R), who turns 70 next month and who
told Fox News's Tucker Carlson on Monday that, if called on "to take a
chance on your survival in exchange for keeping the America that all
America loves for your children and grandchildren," he — and other
seniors, the demographic most vulnerable to the coronavirus — would be
"all in."

StoriesTHE FORCES OF GOODWhen the long-held conacaste was on the edge of
the entrance began to languish, a kind of nostalgic sensation spread
among the surrounding trees. And the one that was most affected was the
jícaro that was at the point where the rustic garden became a
wasteland."What's happening to you guys? Asked them one morning the
equidistant grapefruit."It's just the air. The jícaro replied by turning
a branch."The air? Just take a deep breath and we'll all be happy.When
it was already busy, a flock of pigeons began to revolve around, as if
looking for where to perch.

Christie Digital’s COO, Zoran Veselic put his finger on it: “When new
hires arrive with a minimal skillset or knowledge we must allocate some
of our time to coaching and mentoring them. That’s our responsibility –
to make sure succession is in place and that you have new talent eager
to replace you.”

Visavvi’s head of global strategy, Elliott Moores agrees. “This is a
selfless act for the greater good of the individual and the industry. As
a business or individual looking to begin mentoring you have to be
wholeheartedly committed to give your time, experience, knowledge and
patience for potentially little return – so be prepared but not
deterred,” he says. “Passion can be harnessed and directed under the
right mentorship.”

If you're under 30, it's hard right now to think about anything except
that hazy future when the virus recedes and most of us, hopefully, go
back to our normal lives. Will *generation Z* be the second successive
cohort that sees its dreams put on hold indefinitely by an economic
crisis not of its making? Will its members, too, end up living at home
for years and working a series of dispiriting service jobs that lead
nowhere? Worse still, what if those service jobs don't survive months of
everyone eating and shopping and entertaining themselves at home? I'm
here to offer a bit of reassurance.

Before we get to that, however, I'm going to lay out the bad news, so
that you know I'm not just trying to cheer you up. The next few months
are going to give us the sharpest, most devastating contraction in
America's recorded economic history. Goldman Sachs is forecasting that
almost onefourth of all economic activity will grind to a halt for
April, May and June.

The first months of 2020 have been very exhausting, to say the least. We
experienced a volcanic eruption, and are still not out of the woods with
the threat of COVID-19. While our vision for the future remains hazy, I
remain optimistic that for the rest of the year, we will hear many
stories anchored on the tagline "20-20 vision." For me, this is more
than just a catchy phrase, but a call to sharpen our focus on the
persistent gaps and glaring problems in society.

Coincidentally, March is also Women's Month, which is why I think it is
only appropriate to discuss issues that I have observed affect women the
most. As business leaders, we have the responsibility to understand,
come up and implement the best solutions to address these gaps to
empower our women and the workplace of the future.

Almost as one, traditional media, boomer social media and state and
federal politicians have come together to wag their collective finger of
blame for Australia’s COVID-19 crisis at the designated villain:
millennials.

They’re “negligent”, says the PM. “Selfish”, say various state premiers.

To wash your hands for 20 seconds, the CDC-recommended minimum, experts
have recommended vigorously scrubbing through two rounds of “Happy
Birthday." To mix up the soundtrack, try these hit songs from across
four generations — each has a 20-second chorus, give or take a second.

For those of us lucky enough to be home safe and healthy during the
coronavirus pandemic, group video platforms are making a heroic rise
from last resort to daily routine. For me, they’ve actually resulted in
a busier social life than pre-coronavirus days.

By Anoothi VishalLife will hardly remain the same when we get to the
other side of the Covid-19 pandemic. Economists and social scientists
are predicting lasting changes in the way we live, work and eat. Some of
these were already in the making but are expected to be fast-tracked as
people change their habits to contend with the epidemic. It is likely
that “some of these habits will stick”, says Susan Athey, a professor of
economics of technology at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, in
The Washington Post. What changes will we see in India?How will the
pandemic affect restaurants and the culture of eating out that had been
steadily evolving in the last decade and a half, but was impacted by the
economic slowdown for several months now? One of the sectors worst
affected by Covid-19 will be food services, estimated at Rs 4,23,865
crore in India and employing more than 700,000 people, according to the
National Restaurant Association of India.

The U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a domestic
travel advisory for New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut on Saturday
night, the FDA approved a fast new coronavirus test and a naval hospital
ship left Norfolk, Virginia, for New York City.

President Donald Trump said earlier Saturday he was considering imposing
a two-week quarantine on New York and parts of New Jersey and
Connecticut to deal with the rapid spread of COVID-19. He later tweeted
"a quarantine will not be necessary," saying the CDC's advisory would
follow.

If you're under 30, it's hard right now to think about anything except
that hazy future when the virus recedes and most of us, hopefully, go
back to our normal lives. Will *Generation Z* be the second successive
cohort that sees its dreams put on hold indefinitely by an economic
crisis not of its making? Will its members, too, end up living at home
for years and working a series of dispiriting service jobs that lead
nowhere? Worse still, what if those service jobs don't survive months of
everyone eating and shopping and entertaining themselves at home?

I'm here to offer a bit of reassurance.

History repeats itself in almost every mythological system: Agamemnon
sacrificed his daughter Ifigenia to ensure good winds to sail to the
Battle of Troy; human sacrifice was an integral part of the Aztec
religious ritual; Christians argue that Jesus of Nazareth died for the
sins of all mankind. In each case, we see the characteristics of
religious sacrifice: giving up the lives of some select scapegoats to
rebalance society.

Put a couple of rubber bands in your pocket. Get a cart and wipe down
the handle with wipes, if provided. Go immediately to the produce
section. For *Gen Z*, that's the area with bright, colorful objects
piled on tables. Pull a clear bag from a roll and put it over grabbing
hand. Wrap the rubber band over bag at forearm. Shop. Don't touch
anything with the hand not in the bag. If there are no wipes at entry,
bag both hands. Pile stuff on conveyor belt with bagged hand. Stick in
or swipe card with clean hand. Punch buttons and sign with bagged hand.
When finished, turn bags(s) inside out, tie off and drop in garbage at
exit.Kim Shanahan

U.S., March 28 -- Artificial Intelligence (AI) regulation has gone
mainstream.

Previously the concern of specialist think-tanks, policy influencers and
science fiction enthusiasts, a flood of recent interventions show that
AI regulation is now a core focus for some of the world's most powerful
organizations and governments.

She tends towards the melancholy and macabre, but at barely 18, Billie
Eilish has swept the Grammys, smashed music charts and become the
planet’s hottest pop star. How has a love of “freaking people out”
helped reel so many in?

SOMETIME DURING the night of September 4, 2018, Billie Eilish took her
own life – in a dream. “I jumped off a building,” she recalled recently.
What was most alarming about it, as she looked back, was how little it
alarmed her. “I was in a really bad place mentally,” Eilish said; the
dream struck her less as a nightmare than as a grimly alluring fantasy.
The next day, she approached her older brother, Finneas O’Connell, a
songwriter and producer, and told him about it.

As Americans shelter in place with many spending most or all of each day
at home, three new streaming services are prepping for launch: Quibi,
Peacock and HBO Max.

They are hitting the market at a stomach-churningly weird time for the
world and for the companies – and investors – that own them. As it turns
out, though, quarantine has sent already robust television and streaming
usage levels through the roof as we all look to our screens more than ever.

San Juan, 27 Mar (EFE News).- The COVID-19 pandemic is causing more than
half of Puerto Ricans to be concerned about food and supply shortages,
65%, while lack of medicine causes 47% concern, according to the result
of a survey.

Fear reflected among the island's population comes when the Department
of Health reported that the death toll from coronavirus in Puerto Rico
increased to three on Friday and positive cases add up to 79.

Young people, it seems, have been behaving badly when it comes to
matters of coronavirus.

In Kentucky, they had a "coronavirus party," where at least one attendee
got coronavirus; a 21-year-old contracted coronavirus after recording a
video in blatant disregard of social distancing; spring breakers flocked
to beaches, and one apologized after telling a reporter, "If I get
corona, I get corona" as he partied amid the pandemic.

"We just can't do that. We can't transform our economy. We can't change
that fast."

Last summer, Jasper McTaggart came to the abrupt realization that life
as he knew it may be coming to an end. He was nine years old. It was
lunchtime, and he was eating a sandwich in the dining hall of a New
Hampshire summer camp. Sitting near him, a fellow camper had just opened
a letter from home, and in the envelope was a news clipping with a
picture from Paris, where temperatures were reaching record, fatal
highs. Jasper looked up from the picture and at the faces of his
friends. “We’re not in climate change now, are we?” he asked the table.

“Yes, we are,” his counselor confirmed.

The latest Market Talks covering Financial Services. Exclusively on Dow
Jones Newswires at 4:20 ET, 12:20 ET and 16:50 ET.

1625 ET - Gastrobar chain Bar Louie will move forward with a proposed
sale to its lenders after not receiving any other qualified bids for its
assets, court papers show. Sun Capital Partners-backed Bar Louie
canceled a bankruptcy sale auction slated for Monday. Bar Louie filed
for chapter 11 bankruptcy in January after closing 38 restaurants and
arranging the deal with its lenders serving as the stalking horse, or
lead bidder. Lenders, led by Antares Capital, agreed to acquire the
chain's remaining corporate-owned restaurants, about 72 in all, with a
credit bid of $82.5M. The hearing to seek approval of the sale is set
for April 7. (aisha.al-muslim@wsj.com; @aishaalmuslim)

1625 ET - Gastrobar chain Bar Louie will move forward with a proposed
sale to its lenders after not receiving any other qualified bids for its
assets, court papers show. Sun Capital Partners-backed Bar Louie
canceled a bankruptcy sale auction slated for Monday. Bar Louie filed
for chapter 11 bankruptcy in January after closing 38 restaurants and
arranging the deal with its lenders serving as the stalking horse, or
lead bidder. Lenders, led by Antares Capital, agreed to acquire the
chain's remaining corporate-owned restaurants, about 72 in all, with a
credit bid of $82.5M. The hearing to seek approval of the sale is set
for April 7. (aisha.al-muslim@wsj.com; @aishaalmuslim)

1504 ET - Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz says the central bank
faces no set limit when it comes to expanding its balance sheet. BOC on
Friday unveiled plans for large-scale asset purchases that marked a
first clear foray into quantitative easing. Poloz said the goal of the
purchases is to accommodate demands for liquidity and noted the central
bank has already increased its balance sheet by about C$90 billion with
other liquidity-boosting measures during the past two weeks. "There's no
theoretical limit to this, and I'm hopeful that it's too big," Poloz
said in a press conference. "No firefighter ever got criticized for
using too much water." (kim.mackrael@wsj.com; @kimmackrael)

1456 ET - The sudden spike in jobless claims suggests more ugly data lay
ahead, says Michael Darda, Chief Economist at MKM Partners. He projects
unemployment skyrocketing to 16% from 3.5%, setting the stage for an
unprecedented, "frighteningly large" contraction in GDP. "We are going
to see some ugly numbers on jobs, unemployment and GDP for a while," he
says. "Buckle your seatbelt." (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)
