Forever 21 says it has lowered its costs considerably since it entered
Chapter 11 almost four months ago. But now it is on overdrive pursuing a
going-concern deal, the retailer told a Delaware bankruptcy judge
Friday, though it did not name any potential buyers. 

WWD reported Friday that Authentic Brands Group is teaming up with a
landlord to look into buying the the fast-fashion chain out of
bankruptcy. The retailer has already shuttered 102 stores in the U.S.,
and secured some $91 million in rent concessions at the stores that
remain open, according to a filing Friday by Jonathan Goulding, Forever
21’s chief restructuring officer, who is a managing director at
professional services firm Alvarez & Marsal.

The Conservatives’ pledge of £500m to open a few lines is not nearly
enough to undo the damage of the Beeching era

Ron Cotton, who died last week, was a British Rail manager in the 1980s
who was told by his bosses to prepare the Settle to Carlisle line for
closure as passenger numbers were dwindling. Instead he battled to keep
one of the north’s most scenic rail routes open. The majority of the
stations had already been closed along the track, the spectacular
Ribblehead viaduct was crumbling and sleepers were rotting. BR’s head of
policy, John Prideaux, called the line “a 73-mile museum”.

Let’s get this out of the way first: There’s no such thing as
generations having distinct, neatly defined identities. Greatest
Generation, Silent Generation, baby boomers, Generation X, millennials,
*Gen Z*: These are social constructs that bear little relationship to
the real world.

There’s no such thing as a “generation” as a proper noun group that is
noticeably different than other age cohorts.

In January 1969, Tom Hayden, a founder of the radical Students for a
Democratic Society and a leader of the antiwar movement, came to speak
at the University of California at Santa Cruz, on behalf of the SDS
chapter where I was a member. At the time, many on the new left thought
a revolution was imminent. Major cities had been set ablaze by rioters;
gun-toting members of the Black Panther Party had confronted legislators
in Sacramento; hundreds of thousands were marching against the Vietnam
War; and with Richard Nixon in office — and the war showing no signs of
abating — the protests were turning violent.

As much as a blank slate can be needed to feel energized, there's equal
satisfaction in building upon what you've been trying for the past year
-- or, in this case, decade. So for 2020, let's take six trends into
consideration as we encourage growth instead of a hard reset.

Adopt a mobile-first mentality. Being truly mobile-first includes
embracing content that's vertical-centric, which is often not our
default as marketers. Consider Snapchat with its Snap Originals, an
early pioneer of vertical.

When Leonard Steinhorn hosted Thanksgiving at his Logan Circle apartment
in November, a friend and fellow baby boomer surprised the 20-somethings
in attendance with special gifts: T-shirts printed with the viral
put-down "OK boomer." *Generation Z*'s mocking dismissal of out-of-touch
old people had ricocheted across the Internet earlier that month, and
playing it up in front of Steinhorn doubled as a good-natured inside
joke: The longtime American University communication professor, and
author of the 2006 tome "The Greater Generation: In Defense of the Baby
Boom Legacy," is perhaps the nation's biggest boomer booster.

1338 ET - With retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles falling 5.2%
in the US last year compared with 2018 amid an economic expansion in its
most important market, the company gets a question about whether it
would ever consider strategic alternatives, including a potential sale,
should its transformation efforts not pan out. On a call with analysts,
CEO Matt Levatich says Harley-Davidson's board always is mindful of the
need to maximize shareholder value in assessing the company's strategy
when asked about alternatives. He also cites the bike maker's efforts to
build its customer base in the US and lead in electric-powered bikes as
examples of how it is looking to turn things around, among others.

1335 ET - More than half of financial firms that don't disclose the
amount of greenhouse-gas emissions they have funded cite a lack of
standardized accounting and data challenges, but 70% are interested in
creating a collaborative, open-source framework to track the effect of
lending on climate change, according to a survey of 70 firms with assets
of nearly $40 trillion by the Institute of International Finance and the
European Banking Federation. "We need to work to make an even bigger
difference through our indirect emissions, by partnering with customers
in the shift to a low carbon economy," says Jean Pierre Mustier,
president of the EBF and CEO of Italy's Unicredit.

Think about a supermarket of which you are not a fan, and how their ad
campaigns disinterest you. Now think about reading stories about this
company that really appeals to you; – perhaps the animal lover, reader,
educator, social worker, dreamer. This unexpectedly alters the way you
perceive this company.

There’s a running meme that the cryptocurrency community is filled to

According to legendary Silicon Valley venture capitalist Tim Draper,
this should be true, recently advising young people to buy
Bitcoin[https://blockonomi.com/how-to-invest-in-bitcoin/].

Society is quickly redefining what it means to be chic, fashionable, or
edgy in our evolving world. The coolness of luxury used to be linked to
excess and exclusivity. Bigger was better. Greed was commonplace to a
certain extent and our clothing reflected that. There were no limits on
what we could have in fashion — synthetic chemicals provided
neon-colored dyes whose unnatural hues exist nowhere within a rainbow’s
spectrum. Similarly, we designed polyesters to perform in ways no
natural fiber ever could. When it became “cool” for denim to look
lived-in, we even engineered and streamlined the destruction of brand
new textiles. When we wanted to offer everyday, accessible cashmere or
fur, no one said no — desperate suppliers filled the orders at
rock-bottom prices no matter what it took. Trends galloped from runway

continue that trajectory without losing balance or resources.

1128 ET - Polaris sees a resilient consumer and economy as a trend that
will continue in 2020 for the powersports industry, Chairman and CEO
Scott Wine says on a call with investors. But the company is also
watching out for recession signals, Wine says. "Recession risk is likely
to rise throughout the year, and we will remain vigilant and ready with
our contingency plans," Wine says. The powersports company has stronger
growth expectations in the Asia-Pacific region, and it sees lower tariff
effects with the US's phase-one trade agreement with China, Wine says.
Polaris shares are up 3.5% on higher 4Q profit and sales, although sales
missed analyst expectations. (dave.sebastian@wsj.com; @depsebastian)

market in 2019

Sales of adult-use cannabis in Colorado eclipsed $1.4 billion in 2019, a
record for the state that likely was propelled by new customers entering
the market.Recreational marijuana sales were up 16% in 2019, marking the
first time that sales growth accelerated from year to year in any
adult-use cannabis market, not just Colorado’s.Sales in mature adult-use
markets such as Colorado, Oregon and Washington state reliably increase
from year to year, but the rate of change drops as time goes on.As a
result, many industry experts assumed that adult-use sales in Colorado
would not rise by more than 11% in 2019, the growth rate from 2017 to
2018.Liz Connors, director of analytics at Seattle-based point-of-sale
data provider Headset, suggests that the growth in Colorado’s industry
comes from an increase in unit sales driven by new consumers coming into
the state's marijuana market. She gets there through a process of
elimination.Broadly speaking, there are two ways to increase sales:

1053 ET - Sprint's financial health and performance in the final three
quarters of 2019 provide a glimpse of what the company might look like
if it is unable to merge with T-Mobile, Nomura Instinet says.
"Standalone Sprint is not on a healthy trajectory and is sensibly
preparing to refocus should the deal break," the firm says, adding it
believes Sprint is considering a narrower focus on metro markets. The
company is less promotional and much of its postpaid additions came from
data devices, not more lucrative phone additions, Instinet says.

10:48 ET - If you employ *Gen Z* and millennial workers, be prepared to
face bolder negotiating tactics. Nearly 60% of such workers say they've
leveraged a potential job offer as a negotiation tactic for more pay at
their current firms, in contrast to just 48% of Gen X employees and 29%
of boomers, according to survey findings from Randstad US. The survey
also found younger workers have higher expectations for raises, with 74%
of millennials saying they expect a raise every year to stay at their
companies, compared to 62% of boomers. Employers should "be more aware
of their compensation offerings in order to stay competitive," said Jim
Link, chief human resources officer, Randstad North America.

NEW YORK, Jan. 28, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- A pioneer in automated research
technologies, quantilope has launched a mobile application of its fully
automated implicit method. Implicit market research unlocks the
opportunity to tap into a consumer's subconscious associations towards a
brand, category, product, or idea.

quantilope's mobile implicit test reveals how strongly consumers
associate characteristics and attributes towards a brand, measured by
the implicit association strength (IAS). The IAS in percentage shows how
frequently an item is deemed to fit with a category (weighted by
reaction time).

If the Hyperloop – ultra-fast transportation that zips you to a city and
back in next to no time – is a reality, will there be such a need to
stay in hotels on business? Work on the Hyperloop is speeding up and the
futuristic transport solution could be a reality sooner than we think.
You could take a business trip and return the same day.

Will there be only leisure hotels then?

Billie Eilish, the 18-year-old phenomenon who swept the Grammys on
Sunday[https://proxylibrary.hse.ru:2346/articles/lizzo-opens-high-profile-grammys-11580088343],
is not a traditional pop star: She whispers nearly as much as she sings,
and blurs genres like pop, rock and electronic music. She sports
black-green hair, dresses in baggy clothes and collaborates with her
older
brother[https://proxylibrary.hse.ru:2346/articles/billie-eilish-has-a-brother-named-finneas-hes-ready-to-headline-11566738002].

Music critics say the popularity of her brooding songs and
streaming-fueled success signal a shift in pop music away from the
radio-friendly stars of the past decade like Taylor Swift and Beyoncé.

Drinks industry waking up (with a clear head) to the notion there is
money in sobriety, writes Katy Salter

Dry January participants used to have two options. Hunch over a lime and
soda in the pub, or stay in until February. In 2020, "not drinking"
looks very different. There are sober bars in London, a raft of no and
low-alcohol products, and booze-free cocktails at leading bars. With one
in 10 British drinkers participating in Dry January, the industry is
waking up to the notion there could be money in sobriety.

AS the digital age surfaced, the gig economy formed its own market at
its peak with no plans of slowing down. Indeed, the World Bank data
underlines that in 2018 itself, 25.3 per cent of the Malaysian labour
force are freelancers and it puts our country’s gig economy as growing,
to as much as 26 per cent of the total economic growth. Prime Minister
Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad had said that the gig economy will be made part
of the 12th Malaysia Plan. Generally, it is like working in a free
market system whereby workers are allowed to work independently without
being tethered to long-term contracts with any company. In Malaysia, the
most common gig economy jobs are those related to e-hailing and delivery
services like Grab, Foodpanda and Gojek. The reason why more people out
there, especially the fresh graduates, opt for the gig economy is simply
because it is not easy to secure a permanent job nowadays. As of
November last year, the number of unemployed people was at 513,900.

Alongside fintech’s more traditional business financial goals and
performance targets, it’s worth applying the same exercise to diversity

2020 likely to help the fight against discrimination? Angela Peacock,
CEO of diversity and inclusion training consultancy, PDT Global answers
these questions below.

What did we learn about equality this year?

Employees are a company’s biggest brand ambassadors and corporates are
waking up to the fact that the focussed attention to developing customer
relations needs to be given to their workforce. But organisations are
finding it tough feeding the needs of millennials and *Gen Z*, who are
the most intuitive regarding digital capabilities.

In today’s digital society, *Gen Z* intuitively think first digitally,
which makes it the best generation to anticipate consumer and
constituent needs. Employee benefits firm Sodexo is reaching out to the
younger, mobile-savvy generation in a markedly new manner.

Beirut -- Discussions about economic development often focus on how to
increase income equality. More recently, however, thoughtful observers
have begun to regard consumption equality - the equal use of goods and
services - as a more robust indicator of parity in human wellbeing.
After all, it more accurately captures inequality as people experience
it when they consume, and consumption can be affected by borrowing and
saving, as well as by social safety-net programs.

But consumption equality is a double-edged sword. Although increased
consumption by citizens of less-developed countries will improve the
lives of millions, it will likely have negative consequences for the
planet’s already stressed environment. Furthermore, reducing the high
levels of individual consumption in richer countries may result in
short-term economic pain until new long-term sustainable production and
consumption practices are in place.

The number of Americans living in multigenerational households is at a
record
high[https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/04/05/a-record-64-million-americans-live-in-multigenerational-households/]
and stretches across all ages. Young adults are now most likely to live
with other generations, whereas previously it was adults aged 85 and
older. With residences containing a significant span of age groups,
smart retailers need to recognize the necessity for a tiered
merchandising strategy for consumer products.

The rise of multigenerational households means there are multiple
decision-makers with shopping responsibility. This requires retailers to
account for differences in generational attitudes regarding brand
loyalty, price sensitivity, and perception of value.

Grocers seeking younger customers need to focus on technology and
convenience.

According to the “Consumer Connect Q4 2019” study from retail market
intelligence firm IRI, the number one factor that will attract *Gen Z*
shoppers to a particular grocery store is technology that makes shopping
there more exciting (57%). While a good assortment of prepared/easy prep
meal solutions comes in a close second (56%), *Gen Z* also look for
grocery store features including online purchase with in-store pickup
(46%) and subscription services for frequently purchased items (33%).

It's the marketing bonanza that arrives every four years: A presidential
election in the U.S. A Summer Olympics, as well as the UEFA European
soccer championship. A leap year and, in this year at least, the Chinese
zodiac Year of the Rat.

Just like those high-impact events, many of the other forces that will
shape 2020's marketing and advertising activity are not only on the
calendar but already fully in motion. The California Consumer Privacy
Act (CCPA) went into effect on New Year's Day; marijuana became legal in
even more states; 5G is here; and Brexit will happen at the end of March.

Relaxing dress codes and offering free lunches. These are a few of the
initiatives that private equity firms hope will help them attract and
retain young talent, according to a report published by consultancy firm EY.

Buyout groups have come under increasing pressure to attract a new

technology.

According to a study organized by trend forecasting company WGSN and
presented at Project New York, 94 percent of respondents aged 18-25

Today's environment of disruption and digitization is pressuring
businesses of all types to transform. Get it right, and there are new
opportunities; get it wrong, and the organization risks its market
share. However, at the heart of this evolution, the role of leadership
is often overlooked. Leaders of all businesses - large or small, legacy
or startup, mom-and-pop or multinational - are challenged to transform
for the digital age.

Transformative companies have leaders who are not afraid to ask hard
questions and adapt new strategies or novel processes. Executives at
businesses ranging from heritage investment banks to commercial cruise
lines to startup digital media platforms can all establish an effective
digital transformation strategy by asking themselves four key questions.

While other freshman at Boston College were socializing at frat parties
and local bars, Madison Semarjian, an English major with a penchant for
poetry, was writing a business plan for the smartphone shopping app
Mada, which she described as the Tinder for complete looks.

Semarjian, who calls herself a business-minded creative, assembled a
team of data scientists and computer engineers, and approached retailers
about joining Mada, which combines artificial intelligence and machine
learning to provide users with a personalized experience. Nordstrom and
Macy’s got on board, along with 2,600 smaller specialty stores and
brands such as Reese Witherspoon’s Draper James.

Only 34% of Americans say the next U.S. presidential election will be
about the economy (and only 27% of democrats), according to polls
referred to in an analysis by the European Parliament.

But employment, health care, immigration, and the environment continue
to take the top spot when Americans are asked what problem "is what
matters most to you right now."

Scary. Disgusting. Wrong. Dirty. Stressful. Unnatural. Unsafe. It was
sad and exasperating by turns listening to the young women on Chidera
Eggerue’s eye-opening documentary describing their perfectly normal
pubic hair like a particularly virulent form of invasive species.

I sighed and snorted at the show’s premise. Eggerue – a 24 year old
author and social media influencer – was “challenging herself” and five
friends to let their pubes grow out for six weeks. As a busy mum in my
mid-forties, my idea of “a challenge” would be to give my bikini line
any consideration at all on a day I’m not going swimming.

MILAN — Technology can facilitate and foster the customer experience on
many levels. Fashion companies are increasingly taking note and
implementing digital services often enhanced by the use of artificial
intelligence.

Milan-based company Certilogo, a global platform providing fashion and
luxury businesses with smart and high-tech solutions that simultaneously
enable customers to verify the authenticity of their purchased item and
get access to digital content, has conducted two studies outlining the
scenario of the adoption of tech-enabled consumer engagement tools and

It took a baby-shower invitation to make me realize just how far the
resale economy has come.

The invite steered me toward the registry of the parents-to-be, who
opened their list with this line: "We always love and prefer used items
over new ones."

With her radical style and songs of self-loathing, the singer has swept
the board at this year’s biggest music awards – and inspired devotion
from her fellow teenagers

Just before Billie Eilish won album of the year at the Grammys on Sunday
night, she was caught on camera. “Please don’t be me, please,” she
appeared to be saying, as if appalled by her own success.

Virtual influencers are not real people, they are social media profiles
that have a human image and even tell a personal story, but they are
actually brands. "It's a brand that other companies use to promote their
products," says Luis Díaz, CEO of H2H agency specializing in influencer
marketing.

They are a new form of fiction, a story made up and told through social
media post. "It is very important that there is a storytelling behind
these characters. That they have their own personality, opinions on
current topics or that support certain causes" says Diaz, this is how
they come to connect with users and followers.

This year will see some major transformations in healthcare benefits. In
the past, employers would complain about annually increasing premiums
but would nevertheless sign on the dotted line. My suspicion is that
this year — and this decade — will see much less of that.

That’s mostly because some of the biggest and most beloved brands —
Amazon, Apple and Walmart, for example — have already taken the lead,
showing employers of similar stature that they can choose a different
path and take healthcare into their own hands.

KITCHENER -- The Aud is so old it was called an arena when it was built.

"The actual term arena has changed," said Chris O'Reilly, a partner at
Toronto's Brisbin Brook Beynon Architects. "We like to use multi-use
sports and entertainment facility or event centre to describe these
buildings now."

Online multi-carrier insurance brokerage, Ensurem, points out that as technology enthusiasts age and devices become ever more alluring, vision maintenance may emerge as an increasingly urgent concern for seniors. 
 

CLEARWATER, Fla., Jan. 27, 2020 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- A new study by the
University of Michigan's Kellogg Eye Center shows that 92 percent of
Medicare beneficiaries wear eyeglasses. Eyeglasses and contact lenses,
however, are not covered by Medicare, leaving the aging population on
their own to deal with the cost of vision correction.(1) "This fact says
Dave Rich, CEO of Ensurem LLC, means people need to be aware of their
options regarding vision care." Rich, whose company is an online
multi-carrier insurance brokerage, adds, "What we're seeing with
Medicare beneficiaries age 65 or older, in the future, we may see across
the entire society."
