*Gen Z*, already the most digitally connected generation, keeps getting
more skillful at social-media shapeshifting. (If you've got doubts,
consider how fast the Dolly Parton Challenge — to create four different
photos for LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram and Tinder — took over Instagram.)

from your old school choir formation to acapella ensembles.

Show choir is an entirely different ball game.

The music streaming market has a new entry called Resso, courtesy of the
same company behind TikTok, which is currently the most popular app
among *Generation Z*. The service is launching in India and Indonesia,
but will soon reach other regions where it faces the same problem - a
fiercely competitive streaming market.

Back in November, there were reports that ByteDance was looking to take
on the likes of Spotify, SoundCloud, and Apple Music with its own music
streaming service.

A significant gap exists between the way leaders and employees view
progress toward equality in their organizations, according to new
research from Accenture. Closing the gap will yield substantial benefits
for companies and their employees.

The report, "Getting to Equal 2020: The Hidden Value of Culture Makers,"
which includes research across 28 countries, including Canada , found
that organizations are at an inflection point: Today's workforce cares
increasingly about workplace culture and believes it is critical to
helping them thrive in the workplace (reported by 79% of women and 65%
of men), and a majority of leaders (63%) believe an inclusive workplace
culture is vital to the success of their business.

YOU could never accuse Arlo Parks of slacking in the friendship stakes.
Growing up in south London, the hotly-tipped singer-songwriter would
often play the role of agony aunt amongst her close circle of pals.
Indeed, Parks' early songwriting career was actually born as a result of
her kindly friendship duties.

Barely two months after Reserve Bank of India (RBI) rejected Kishore
Biyani's investment proposal to throw a ?64-crore lifeline to fashion
e-commerce company Koovs, the latter sacked about half its staff, or 140
people, two people familiar with the development, said.

One of them said except for the technology vertical, the company has
virtually sacked whole teams of buying and merchandising and marketing.
"Koovs has successfully re-financed the business and re-focused its
business priorities, which included streamlining of some of its
operations," Mary Turner, CEO of Koovs, said in an emailed response
without answering specific questions on the sacking of employees. "We
have been instrumental in bringing the latest in international fashion
to Indian wardrobes and will endeavour to become the 'go-to' western
fashion destination for India's millennials and *Gen Z*," she said. In
2018, Biyani's Future Lifestyle Fashions had announced plans to buy 30%
stake in Koovs for ?140 crore.

Top banker Tan Su Shan's combination of leadership and inclusivity makes
her a role model for International Women's Day

SHE MAY BE a high-flying banker at the top of her game, but DBS's Tan Su
Shan is also refreshingly down-to-earth. She wasn't always cool, calm
and Covid-19 battle-ready of course, but after three decades in the
business she's more capable than most – with the credentials (including
a place on all essential power lists) to prove it. It's easy to imagine
Ms Tan, who's in her 10th year at DBS and now Group Head of
Institutional Banking, at ease and in control of just about any situation.

Dating app Tinder has pledged up to $1 million in in-app advertising to
support women entrepreneurs in India. Tinder is inviting applications
from companies where at least 50% of the founding team are women or
identify as women. To qualify, companies should be under 3 years old,
have cumulatively raised less than Rs 35 crores in equity financing, and
actively target *Gen-Z* and millennial audiences in India. Both
for-profit and not-for-profit entities may apply. “Entries will be
accepted on a first come first serve basis for up to 25 startups,
subject to meeting all eligibility criteria, and applications will close
on the 31st of March 2020. Only the first 500 applications will be
considered,” it said in a statement. Over 90% of Tinder’s community is
between the ages of 18-30, and for any women-owned business aimed at
that cohort, the ads are intended to support their business, grow their
network and help them speak directly to potential consumers.

Radical transparency is the new standard. 

A decade after Everlane launched with its “radical transparency” motto
and consequently established a devoted community of young shoppers,
fashion companies from mass to high fashion are following suit, openly
stating their partners and practices. This is largely in pursuit of
*Gen-Z* shoppers.

Yet another indication the tight labor market has shifted power to job
seekers: A new study has found about 1 in 6 job offers are rejected.

That’s a 5-year high, according to job review site
Glassdoor[https://www.glassdoor.com/research/why-candidates-reject-offers/],
which analyzed data from almost 100,000 job candidates. The job offer
rejection rate was about 20 percent in 2010, dropped steadily over the
next five years, to 15.9 percent in 2015, and has been rising since,
reaching 17.3 percent in 2019.

The red sign on the red-draped table reads, “Stop Socialism. Unleash
Capitalism.” For an exhibitor at America’s largest annual conservative
shindig, it’s a slogan as truism, as ubiquitous as U.S. flags and Make
America Great Again caps.

But the actual political messaging by Young Conservatives for Carbon
Dividends (YCCD) borders on subversive. At its booth, sandwiched between
the Federalist Society and a pro-Electoral College group, smartly
dressed students make the case for Republicans to accept mainstream
climate science and support a carbon tax as a capitalist solution.

time with an expanded cast of players. The result should be a night of

— Company Curates Advisement, Mentorship and Community to Connect Women
to Necessary Resources

PURCHASE, NY — A desire to problem-solve lies at the heart of young
women entrepreneurs and this desire starts at a young age. In fact, a
recent study* commissioned by Mastercard found that fifty two percent of
*Gen Z* and 44 percent of Millennial women cited being able to help
others as an important factor in determining their future or current
career path. Mastercard knows that women have the ideas and passion that
can Start Something Priceless, but sometimes the path to actualizing
those ideas isn’t easy, especially when starting your own business.

Europe, March 5 -- Business Chief speaks with Wendy Rowe, Director of
Product, Vision and Strategy for Cloud Strategy Operations at Wolters
Kluwer Tax and Accounting (Europe) on the first generation to grow up
with technology: *Generation Z*.

*Generation Z* (*Gen Z*) is the first generation to grow up with
technology. The older members of this generation have likely experienced
the frustrations of dial-up connection at the turn of the century,
through to the ease of making payments via Alexa at the start of this
decade. This is a generation that is often welded with its Millennial
predecessors, both in misconceptions and tastes. To discuss this
further, we speak with Wendy Rowe, Director of Product, Vision and
Strategy for Cloud Strategy Operations at Wolters Kluwer Tax and
Accounting (Europe). Rowe's experience in the industry bears a holistic
understanding of *Gen Z*'s technology preferences and how the generation
has fared in the workplace in recent years.

Expectations for the work environment are changing as new generations
enter the workforce, and as a result, insurance companies are facing
increased pressure to evaluate their focus on diversity and inclusion to
recruit and retain young talent.

This was the message from a team of panelists in February at the Women &
Diversity: Expanding Opportunity in Insurance conference, co-hosted by
the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, the Life Insurance
Council of New York and ACLI in New York City.

VSCO, a popular photo editing app (and *Gen Z* meme), is continuing to
shift its focus to video. Last month, the company finally gave its
creators the ability to publish their video edits to the VSCO feed
alongside their photos. And today VSCO is rolling out a more powerful
and complex video editing tool called Montage.

Already, VSCO allowed users to apply photo-like edits to their videos by
doing things like applying filters or adjusting the exposure, for
example. But Montage is an entirely different sort of video editing
experience. Now users will be able to tell longer video stories
involving scenes, where they can even stack and layer one or more
videos, photos, colors and shapes in order to create a collage-like
finished product, VSCO explains.

Beauty brands cannot ignore the rising power of *Generation Z* and need
to remain highly engaging in-store yet influential online to draw in the
first truly ‘woke’ generation, says a branding expert.

In 2019, *Generation Z* – currently aged under 23-24 years – represented
around 32% of the global population, nudging ahead of millennials,
according to Bloomberg analysis of United Nations data. And in a recent
report from specialised ad firm The Pull Agency ‘Future of Beauty: Is
Your Brand Ready For *Gen Z*?’, insight on how to target this
demographic indicated important shifts in shopping and brand engagement
behaviour.

An estimated 499 Kenyans dropped from the rank of dollar millionaires
last year, highlighting how the impact of Kenya’s soft economy has hurt
persons who each had a net worth of more than Sh100 million.

The 2020 Knight Frank’s Wealth Report classified 2,900 Kenyans among the
world’s High Net-Worth Individuals (HNWIs) last year, representing a
14.6 percent drop compared to the 2017 count.

Joining Lewis at his shows in the SSE Hydro, Alec is playing for the

For many years, the world of mass-market beauty and personal care has
traded in gender tropes and stereotypes. Think about thick blue
disposable razors vs. dainty pink ones; pine-scented, dark green
deodorant sticks vs. flower-scented, pastel-packaged antiperspirant;
leathery-smelling aftershave in wood-topped bottles vs. pink face lotion
in clear jars. In some cases, although the products aren't very
different - a razor is a razor - the packaging makes the target
demographic clear.

The House Financial Services Committee created its Task Force on
Artificial Intelligence to determine how to use AI in the financial
services industry and examine issues surrounding algorithms, digital
identities, and combating fraud. On February 12, the task force held its
latest  hearing, "Equitable Algorithms: Examining Ways to Reduce AI Bias
in Financial Services."

Congressman Bill Foster (D-IL), chairman of the task force, used his
opening remarks to set out the hearing's scope: what does it mean to
design ethical algorithms that are transparent and fair, and how do we
program fairness and have decisions explained to us?

New Delhi, March 5 -- On their maiden visit to India, Z-Stars - an
international K-pop act - recently performed in Pune, Mumbai, and Delhi.
The group features two Indians - Sid and Priyanka - who were beyond
ecstatic to be performing as global stars in their own country. "It
feels really great to be home, and when you get a chance to perform with
the whole group on home ground, it's the best feeling ever," says Sid.
Priyanka joins in, "I was very nervous because it was my first time as
an international artist in front of my mother. I was also glad that the
rest of our group enjoyed performing in India, thanks to the
enthusiastic audience."

NEW ORLEANS — Advisers should prepare for uncomfortable conversations
with their clients around caretaking and advanced care benefits and
end-of-life planning if they want to ensure those benefits bring value
to their employees.

“The goal is to have an overarching plan in place for when any of us are
in imminent danger of dying and what we want that plan to look like,”
Stacy Gallagher, an RN clinical consultant and agent with Physicians
Mutual Insurance, said at Employee Benefit Adviser’s Workplace Benefits
Renaissance conference. “What kind of decisions can we think about ahead
of time so that burden is lessened on our families?”

Gao Dekang once revealed to a British newspaper that he started Bosideng
in 1976 with no money and eight sewing machines.

Bosideng has since evolved to be a household go-to in China for
technical, weather-resistant outerwear. The company, as a conglomerate,
also manufactures down jackets for brands like The North Face, Adidas
and Columbia Sportswear.

A tsunami is coming. A silver tsunami, that is. We have been discussing
the coming retirement wave for years, and it’s finally here. The 2019
Federal Employee Viewpoint
Survey[https://www.opm.gov/fevs/reports/governmentwide-reports/governmentwide-management-report/governmentwide-report/2019/2019-governmentwide-management-report.pdf]
projects that one in four federal employees will retire within the next
five years. The scenario for state and local government employees is
similar. I can personally attest that we are losing incredible talent
and institutional knowledge at an alarming rate as career public
servants retire or move to industry. Agencies need to accelerate their
digital transformation efforts now to retain top talent and attract new
talent to fill the gap.

<th>I Am Not Okay With This, Netflix’s quirky new dramedy about an
angsty 17-year-old with strange powers, looks and feels uncannily
familiar. It isn’t just the show’s plot elements, although those seem
appropriated whole hog from existing works, too: Sydney (played by
Sophia Lillis) has cropped hair, telekinetic powers, and
anger-management issues just like Stranger Things’ Eleven, and in the
opening scene of the show, she stalks through town in a white gown
that’s been doused with blood, like a postmillennial Carrie. (The
cross-pollination gets knottier still when you realize that Lillis
played a young Beverly Marsh in the recent film adaptations of Stephen
King’s It.)

After its stupendous success with TikTok, ByteDance now wants to expand
its footprint in India’s booming music streaming market as well with a
new app called Resso. The Chinese social media giant, valued at over $70
billion, hopes to replicate TikTok’s success with Resso, pitched as the
world’s first social music streaming app. The new music streaming app
has been in testing for a few months in the country before it went live
on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store today.

'Riling up the base and using anger and fear to turn out people works
better for Republicans than it does for Democrats'

Joe Biden was in the middle of delivering the victory speech of his life
late Tuesday night when a pair of animal rights protesters thought
they'd steal the spotlight.

2020 MAR 4 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at
Mergers & Acquisitions Week -- Authentic Brands Group (ABG), a global
brand development, marketing, and entertainment company, announced the
acquisition of America's original fast fashion retailer, Forever 21. ABG
and Simon Property Group (Simon) (NYSE: SPG) will each own 37.5 percent,
and Brookfield Property Partners (Brookfield) (NASDAQ: BPY) will own 25
percent of the intellectual property and operating businesses.

With this move, ABG, Simon, and Brookfield become the new ownership
group for Forever 21. Building on the success of Aeropostale, this
similar ownership structure positions Forever 21 for long-term
performance and growth. This acquisition further diversifies ABG's
experiential retail and eCommerce vertical and boosts the value of its
brand portfolio to $12.5 billion in global annual retail sales.

my books, there were three keys:

How they know if you cheat on your return

Mailboxes are flooded with tax forms every year around this time, and
many of them can be confusing, feel unnecessary or involve seemingly
trivial amounts of money. But before succumbing to the urge to shove
those pieces of paper into a drawer and pretend they don’t exist, beware
— the IRS probably already knows what’s in that drawer. Two tax pros
explain.

They are in their early 20s, but are already changing the digital
industry; they have never lived in a nondigital world; and they most
recently outnumbered millennials worldwide, now making up 32% of the
global
population[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-20/gen-z-to-outnumber-millennials-within-a-year-demographic-trends].

This is *Generation Z* — the next generation of consumers and a critical
target audience for the payments industry and the digital economy. Until
now, a lot of the fintech revolution has been driven by millennials, but
*Gen Z* will be the next users of payment platforms. So, what must
payments companies do to meet their expectations?

About three months ago, Chinese tech giant ByteDance (which also owns
TikTok) launched the beta version of its music streaming app in India
and Indonesia.

Resso, as it is called, is a standalone product and doesn't carry the
ByteDance tag — a fact company executives cannot stress enough.

Calls for trigger warnings ahead of the latest Netflix hit suggest a
more compassionate generation than the ones that came before it, writes
Adam White

*Generation Z* are whatever wrong-headed newspaper columnists want them
to be. Depending on what you read, today’s teens are either too militant
in their beliefs or too bereft of them. Having only ever been alive in
the internet age, they are reactionary snowflakes or emotional vacuums.

Hospitality firms are looking to expand their footprint in the country
and in a struggling market, real-estate builders are trying to go beyond
residential and commercial projects. And this has led both the parties
to collaborate to change the hospitality sector.

The Prestige Group in Bengaluru has partnered with Marriott
International to open six hotels in the southern belt; Embassy Group is
working with Hilton and Four Seasons Hotels to open for more hotels in
Bengaluru. Godrej Properties in Mumbai has collaborated with Taj Hotels
to open a 5-star luxury property in their Vikhroli township called The
