2019 FEB 2 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at
Marketing Weekly News -- Growth in the tablet market will depend on
whether vendors can hit lower prices with Detachable 2-in-1s for a wider
audience, and Strategy Analytics says new processor technology is
crucial to make that happen. Arm and Qualcomm are working to make this a
reality but without stronger marketing support, better resolution of
compatibility issues, and a more coherent distribution strategy,
Arm-based Detachable 2-in-1s will only comprise half of the market by 2022.

Entrepreneurship is the future, and young women are raring to go

Three years ago when I attended the World Economic Forum in Davos, the
social media sphere seemed to light up with a singular focus: women.

The most effective politicians often have a kind of cynical genius for
speaking the language of feelings while brazenly disregarding facts.
Count Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez among them. Her statements at a
Martin Luther King Day event this week have almost too many fallacies to
count:

Millennials and people, you know, *Gen Z* and all these folks that will
come after us are looking up and we're like: “The world is gonna end in
12 years if we don't address climate change and your biggest issue is
how are we gonna pay for it?”...This is our World War II.

The transformation taking place in manufacturing is undeniable. From the
biggest global manufacturers to the smallest specialty parts-makers, the
way products are designed and built is morphing as digitization
continues to bring a dizzying array of new technologies to factory floors.

As companies integrate tools ranging from robots, internet-connected
sensors and wearable tech to mobile devices and real-time data analytics
into their work environments, the roles human workers play are also
evolving.

Change is inevitable, yet we fear it. Whether it is new technology or
new people, most of us dread having to adjust to the new order of
things. As *Generation Z* or *Gen Z* (born in the mid-’90s or later)
gets ready to enter the global workforce, the murmurs have become louder
-- will they be as restless as the millennials? What kind of work ethic
will they bring? How will they change the way we work? 

Of course, there was uncertainty when the Baby Boomers (born between
1946 and 1964), Generation X (born between 1965 and 1980) and Generation
Y or millennials (born between 1981 and 1995) first arrived too. What
makes the debut of *Gen Z* unique, perhaps, is that this is the first
demographic cohort to have grown up in a constantly connected world.
Naturally, their relationship with technology is a lot more dynamic and
self-assured.

Seoul, Jan 25 (IANS) South Korean men have become the world's biggest
male spenders on skincare, a market that grew by 44 per cent in the
country between 2011 and 2017, a media report said on Friday.

A recent survey by data and analysis consultancy service, GlobalData,
found that about three quarters of South Korean men undertake a beauty
or grooming treatment -- from salon hair treatments to at-home facials
-- at least once a week, CNN reported.

For career-driven individuals, success is still about making it to the
top, but not necessarily following the vertical route of previous
generations. Today's twenty- and thirtysomethings are not wedded to the
notion of a job for life and this has shaped how they see their careers
unfolding.

They have no appetite for waiting patiently for promotion and, because
they expect to change job (if not career) up to six times during their
working lives, they are prepared to up sticks faster than their more
cautious elders.

Mumbai, Jan. 25 -- With two out of three Indians under 30 years, venture
capital funds are increasingly turning to startups that are tapping the
large population of millennial consumers, multiple investors said. A
recent report by private equity firm KKR said the Asian millennial is
expected to reshape the global consumer market, since the continent has
more than six times as many millennials as in the US and Europe
combined. This will have far-ranging implications in healthcare,
wellness, leisure, financial services and entertainment, the report
said. "We are interested in businesses that target customers who have
shown a willingness to try new things," said Sandeep Murthy, founder and
managing partner at Lightbox Ventures. "Millennials have repeatedly
demonstrated their comfort with technology and openness to new products
and services.

As a self-described political conservative, Reagan Larson might seem to
be a natural fit for the Republican Party. The 19-year-old college
student from South Dakota grew up in a Catholic household that objected
to same-sex marriage, and she remains firmly opposed to abortion.

But in many ways, that is where the ideological similarities end. Ms.
Larson, a dual major in biology and Spanish at Gustavus Adolphus College
in St. Peter, Minn., does not oppose the legalization of marriage
equality. She views climate change as undeniable, believes “immigrants
make our country richer,” and disagrees with her parents on the need for
a border wall.

Fresh university graduates were given an average monthly salary of
HK$16,892 in their first job last year - 13 percent higher than the
amount in 2017, a survey from jobs portal Jobs DB shows.

The survey of 553 graduates and undergraduates revealed that "buying
property" has dropped out of the top three of their five-year graduation
targets. It accounted for only 9 percent of respondents on the back of
surging property prices that have put buying out of reach of most graduates.

It's a new year and the sun is out, so most of us are thinking about
what used to be called spring cleaning.

But when did spring cleaning get rebranded into "decluttering" and
become a multimillion dollar industry?

Dogfish Head Craft Brewery, known for beers made with exotic ingredients
that often boast high alcohol levels, is on a health kick.

The Milton, Delaware-based brewer will soon release Slightly Mighty IPA,
a low-alcohol ale (4 percent ABV) with only 95 calories and 3. 6 grams
of carbohydrates, a profile rivaling that of post-workout favorite
Michelob Ultra (95 calories, 2. 6 grams of carbs).

In the cultural warfare over whether January 26 should be retained as
Australia Day, survey results are deployed like guided missiles. But
what do Australians really think about the continuing debate?

*HD* 	*Gen Z* Will Dismantle the Duopoly Unless They’re Taken More
Seriously

It seems like everyone’s gunning for Google and Facebook these days.
Challengers like Amazon and AT&T are threatening to disrupt the current
advertising power concentration held by the two titans. Meanwhile, both
companies are facing increased scrutiny in Washington over everything
from privacy fears to antitrust concerns.

But make no mistake: Competitors and regulators aren’t the biggest
threat to the duopoly. Consumers, specifically *Gen Z* consumers, are
whose spending power and influence within the market grows daily. This
powerful generation stands poised to knock both Google and Facebook back
down to size over the coming decade—not through outward hostility toward
the brands, but via their inherent values and media habits, both of
which run strongly counter to the strategies and principles that enabled
the duopoly’s rise to power.

*HD* 	Why it would be smart for Larry Hogan to challenge Trump

The question for pundits and politicians is not why Maryland Gov. Larry
Hogan (R) may be considering a primary run against President Trump in
2020, but rather, why there aren't many more who are doing the same.

Trump's poll numbers are hitting new lows. In the Associated Press-NORC
poll, for example, "34 percent of Americans approve of Trump's job
performance. ... That's down from 42 percent a month earlier and nears
the lowest mark of his two-year presidency." Only 28 percent of
independents approve of his performance. Much of the drop seems tied to
the shutdown ("Sixty percent of Americans say Trump bears a great deal
of responsibility for the shutdown. ... Almost 3 in 10 Republicans think
Trump bears a great deal of responsibility, while 73 percent of his
party says he's at least partly responsible"), although it is unclear if
he will bounce back once the shutdown ends, or if the eventual
resolution (which will not include a wall) will further alienate his base.

American Eagle Outfitters enlisted its *Gen Z* customers to star in its
new marketing campaign — and also gave them full creative control.

The teen apparel retailer’s spring #AExME campaign was photographed,
styled and creatively directed by ten real and authentic Gen-Zers who
shop and wear American Eagle clothes. The individuals, or “cast
members,” were discovered solely through social media, and no exotic
locations or contrived sets were used in the campaign. Instead, they are
seen in their own personal environments “to showcase the endless
possibilities in which the AE community can define their individual
style,” American Eagle said.

Kate Lewis only wanted art by women in her new office on the 45th floor
of Hearst Tower, and that’s what she got.

There’s a photo by Cindy Sherman, another by Uta Barth, another by…Lewis
can’t quite recall on a recent afternoon. But she knows why the
black-and-white photo of a woman whose entire body, save for the nose
and mouth, is submerged in water spoke to her when she went looking
though the Hearst art collection after her promotion last year to chief
content officer.

In global advertising, winds of change are blowing and brands in
Argentina do not want to be out of the new trends. Whether by
convictions or pressured by their own consumers, more and more companies
are encouraged to pronounce on issues such as sexual minorities,
machismo or politics, which until recently were virtually banned in the
manual of the good Argentine publicity. The warm ones are vomited by
God, says the New Testament, but taking a position also has its risks.
"In the first place, it is not always positive to join a hot topic, it
is necessary to understand what contributes to the brand and how it
aligns with its values," says Mariela Mociulsky, director of the
Trendsity consultancy .

With new year comes the new hustle of everyday activities and the latest

Nearly half of employees (48%) wish their workplace technology performed
just like their personal technology, according to a recent survey by The
Workforce Institute at Kronos Incorporated.

“Once upon a time, workplace technology was far more innovative and
superior to anything that was available for consumer use,” said Joyce
Maroney, executive director, The Workforce Institute at Kronos.
“However, the tables have turned and the opposite is true today. The
proliferation of the on-demand and gig economy apps that now dominate
our everyday lives should prompt organizations to walk a mile in their
employees’ shoes."

Super Bowl Sunday is one of the single-largest retail sales days for
snacks at many supermarkets, according to retail sales data from
Frito-Lay, which released the results of its inaugural U.S. Snack Index
asking consumers what they plan to snack on during this year’s big game
between the New England Patriots and Los Angeles Rams.

“Super Bowl Sunday is one of the busiest shopping days of the year for
snacks,” said Steven Williams, senior vice president of sales, chief
commercial officer, Frito-Lay North America. “It's different than other
holidays we see throughout the year as consumers are most likely to be
enjoying snacks specifically at home, which can mean their choices can
vary from other occasions.”

Tucked away in the basement of an unremarkable commercial centre in
downtown Guangzhou, a booming southern Chinese city, is an important
"factory”. It doesn't produce shoes or shirts, or anything you might
expect; it churns out influential live-streaming celebrities.

Hifan Multi-Channel Network is only a few years old but already is one
of the top five multimedia companies in the city. With only 40 members
of staff, it has created a stable of about 100 live-streaming
celebrities, or key opinion leaders (KOLs).

Unlike truth that sets humans free, social media enslaves.

"Godget" is not just a word I coined for it. Social media has become a
popular god nowadays to the ever-increasing number of people who are
hooked on it. This false deity aims at literally capturing every single
soul on the planet, even that of an innocent child.

Personal finance a top stress factor, meditation and health apps gaining
favour, says Wunderman Thompson study

Being physically healthy is no longer enough today. The definition of
being healthy has expanded from simply not being physically ill to
encompass mental health, sexual health, mindfulness and work-life
balance, according to a new study by Wunderman Thompson.

This weekend, some righteous hell broke out over the Internet, as CBS
News posted the BuzzFeed news story “Are Millennials the ‘Burnout
Generation’?”

The backlash wasn’t because of what was there — but because of what
wasn’t. There was the stodgy silent generation (b. 1928–1945, according
to Pew), the huge baby boomer generation (b. 1946–1964), and the cohort
everybody’s got their knickers in a twist about: the millennials (b.
1981–1996).

Viacom Inc. (VIAB) is buying streaming television service Pluto TV for
$340 million in cash to forge more direct links to consumers.

For Viacom, of course, the overriding strategic question is whether the
parent of MTV, Nickelodeon and Paramount will merge with CBS Inc. (CBS).
However, the purchase of Pluto TV will advance the company's efforts in
emerging platforms.

THE Association of Filipino Franchisers Inc.(AFFI) aims to attract more
aspiring Filipino entrepreneurs into its fold, especially the
millennials and *generation Z*, to venture into business as franchisees
of existing tried-and-tested businesses or by coming up with innovative
business concepts.

'We formed a partnership with the Junior Philippine Institute of
Accountants [JPIA] to entice younger people to join the franchising
business,' AFFI Chairman Eric Caeg said during a recent media interview
at the launch of the 17th Franchise and Business Expo with the theme,
'Galing ng Pinoy: Local is the new Focal,' to be held at the World Trade
Center from February 1 to 3, 2019.

Regarding man-made climate change, press secretary Sarah Huckabee
Sanders says that the White House would rather listen to “a much, much
higher authority” than Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

Fox New host Sean Hannity asked Sanders on Tuesday night to respond to a
statement by Ocasio-Cortez that greenhouse gas emissions have to be
dramatically curbed the next twelve years to avoid catastrophe.

American Eagle is taking the consumer focus group to a whole new level,
enlisting a number of *Gen Z* customers (born between 1995 and 2015) to
star in the brand’s latest marketing effort. But wait—there’s more. The
brand turned over full creative control to these *Gen Z* shoppers,
giving them the freedom to style and shoot themselves for American
Eagle’s Spring ’19 campaign.

“Gone are the days when brands dictated to customers what they should
look like, what they should feel like and what they should do to be
cool. This generation is cool because they are such individuals and they
are so creative and inspiring,” Kyle Andrew, AE CMO, evp of marketing, said.

Burgeoning transportation alternatives eventually could claw into
traditional vehicle ownership, according to the latest installment of
the Cox Automotive Evolution of Mobility Study.

Other studies indicate Americans appear loath to give up their personal
vehicles, but the Cox study says retail auto sales in the U.S. could
drop nearly 30% as alternatives to traditional ownership become more
accessible and affordable.

HMP Law Chairman Hwang Ju-myung, center, answers during a Q&A session in
Fleishman Hillard's Asia Pacific Leadership session in Seoul,
Wednesday.By Oh Young-jin Today's Korea presents a unique set of
challenges to foreign firms, thanks to a changing business environment,
so they should understand the market better if they want to prosper in
one of the world's most-vibrant economies, says a noted lawyer who has
long advised foreign firms. In a speech Wednesday, Hwang Ju-myung,
chairman of HMP Law, first talked about Korea's history of compressed
development and its side effects. “Korea has a “can-do spirit” that
lives in most Koreans,” Hwang told representatives of Fleishman Hillard,
a global public relations firm, at its Asia Pacific Leadership session
in Seoul. “This first came to the foreground in the 1970s and '80s, when
the Korean economy developed enormously.“Now Korea is infused with the
spirit of the 'Candlelight Revolution' that forced President Park
Geun-hye out of office.

Trade wars. Currency movements. Trade balances. Normalizing interest
rates. Combating climate change and poverty. Year after year, the G-20
discusses the same narrow range of issues, never agrees on very much and
follows up on even less with any real action. But this year might just
be different. The Japanese are taking the chair and, to their credit,
they have decided to put something that genuinely matters at the top of
the agenda, namely demographics.

Even more striking, they are challenging a cozy consensus of the past
couple of decades. Most mainstream economists and policymakers take it
for granted that a declining population is bad for the economy and we
need to do all we can to reverse it. But the Japanese are starting to
argue that it may not be true. Technology might mean that we need fewer
people, while all the services required by the elderly might actually
stimulate demand. If true, policies to combat an aging population might
be a big mistake.

Everyone appreciates fast delivery, but some demographic groups are more
likely to pay for it.

According to the recent E-commerce Shipping Needs Survey from Hanover
Research and delivery company LaserShip, Millennial and *Gen Z*
consumers are up to three times as likely to pay for expedited shipping
as older shoppers. Findings indicate 47% of *Gen Z* and 43% of
Millennial respondents have ever paid for free shipping, compared to 39%
of Gen X and 26% of Baby Boomer respondents. All age groups are most
likely to pay for same-day shipping, with 40% of *Gen Z*, 32% of
Millennials, 29% of Gen X and 12% of Baby Boomers saying they would be
likely to do so.

Two-in-five young adults say they have followed a social media
"influencer" that they ultimately learned was computer-generated,
according to a study released this week by Fullscreen.

The study, which surveyed a panel of persons 18-34 last fall, found that
two-thirds (66%) felt "surprised" and/or "intrigued," 60% thought it was
funny, but 42% felt "betrayed" and 41% felt "annoyed."

A recent survey, commissioned by Express Employment Professionals and conducted by Harris Poll, offers a detailed, in-depth look at the outlook of baby boomers who are still working. 
 

OKLAHOMA CITY, Jan. 23, 2019 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Though an estimated
10,000 baby boomers retire daily, many still in the workplace foresee
retirement to come later than expected--either by choice due to the
labor shortage or out of necessity because of economic circumstances.
That is one of the findings of a newly released survey conducted by The
Harris Poll and commissioned by Express Employment Professionals.

L Young people not only distance themselves from the Catholic Church,
but from God. That is the great challenge of Francisco in his seventh
visit to the American continent, where he will preside in Panama the
World Youth Day (WYD). The Pope embarks on his first visit to Panama on
Wednesday, where he will be received by thousands of young Latin
Americans, whom he will urge to transform the world in the face of
poverty, violence and the deep consequences of migration. This is the
third time that Bergoglio has traveled to preside over the Catholic WYD,
after those held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in July 2013, and Krakow,
Poland, in July 2016. This will be the first time he moves in the
Central American area, about 50 thousand young people are registered,
coming from all over the world. More than 200 thousand pilgrims are
expected and there are 38 thousand volunteers who organize the great event.

Amid the melodies from the organ and the quiet murmuring of worshippers
at prayer, churches will soon be filled with the whirring of treadmills,
tapping of keyboards and tinkle of bicycle bells.

The Church of England is to offer desks for young professionals who work
remotely, open on-site gyms and host bicycle-hire schemes as part of a
£35 million drive to attract a more youthful crowd into its pews.

The youngest woman ever elected to Congress again made headlines and
sparked conservative criticism when she said Monday that she and other
young Americans fear "the world is going to end in 12 years if we don't
address climate change."

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., made the remark during an
interview with writer Ta-Nehisi Coates at the MLK Now event in New York
City celebrating the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr.

While Americans believe there are some problems with social media, there
is also good

PAWLEYS ISLAND, S.C., Jan. 23, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Social media,
whether it is Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest or Snapchat, has
become a part of everyday life now and almost nine in ten Americans
(86%) are regular users (at least 1-2 times a week) of one of those
social media sites. And, while so much of the focus on using these sites
is privacy, almost two-thirds of Americans (65%) and over three in five
regular social media users (63%) say people on social media should not
have any expectations of privacy. This is from a survey Regina Corso
Consulting conducted of 2,141 U.S. adults, 18 and older between January
15 and 18, 2019.

It’s a road that’s all too often choked up with traffic. But the A14 in
Suffolk is about to take centre stage in a “significant, and
long-overdue” expansion of logistics and distribution activity that is
bound to provide a welcome boost to the local economy – but which also
makes the need for investment in the A14 more urgent than ever.

For decades, the A14 has provided a vital link between the UK’s largest
container port, Felixstowe, and the so-called ‘Golden Triangle’ of
warehousing and distribution operations in the Midlands, bordered by the
M1, M6 and M42.

Srinagar, Jan. 23 -- Solitary confinement has escaped prisons and
torture rooms and entered our homes and workplaces, making isolation and
loneliness as big a threat to health than obesity, smoking and depression.

Social apps on smartphones have replaced human interaction, reducing
emotion to Facebook posts and Instagram likes that prompt most of us to
spend more time peering into their cell phones than interacting with
real people. It's most apparent in public transport, where millions
travel together every day, often with the same group of people, in
splendid isolation, huddled over phones and tablets and oblivious to the
world, hindustantimes.com wrote.

WHAT a stellar few weeks it’s been for the good folk who live in the
House of the Perpetually Outraged. These are indeed the salad days for
those who do enjoy being upset by the trivial and the silly. Or by ideas
and discussion. Or even the thought of it.

There has been the now annual attempt to close down any discussion about
changing the date of Australia Day. Then there was the hurt feelings of
all those poor, sensitive blokes who managed to upset themselves by
watching an ad for razor blades. You would have to hope their skin is
not as sensitive as their feelings, otherwise shaving would be something
of a nightmare.

Q: I am a furloughed government contractor, currently on unpaid leave. I
am tired of living with the threat of shutdowns disrupting my work. I’ve
been at my current position for less than 18 months, and my job before
that, my first job out of college, lasted exactly 18 months until my
contract ended. I am not searching yet, but do you have any advice on
how to frame why I am looking for a new job already? I don’t want to be
viewed as a job hopper.

A: I think before you finish forming the words “I am a government
contractor,” your interviewers will grok why you’re looking elsewhere.
