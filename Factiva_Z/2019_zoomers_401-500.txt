COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Tattooed models in mustard robes replaced the
usual gray-suited bankers at Nordea Bank's Copenhagen headquarters
recently, as the Danish bank strutted out its latest attempt to woo
young talent.

Hosting a fashion show is just one way companies like Nordea, the
largest financial group in Nordic countries, are trying to attract
twentysomething and thirtysomething employees. As financial services
have moved online, banks have to battle with tech giants like Google and
Amazon, which boast offices with features like massage rooms, to sign up
tech-savvy millennials skilled in areas like artificial intelligence and
programming.

Features | Sarah Young celebrates the no-brainer shade that goes with
absolutely everything – and is no longer seen as bland

From millennial pink to *gen-Z* yellow, some of the most prominent
colour trends to have emerged from fashion in recent years all have one
thing in common: they are bright, bold and unashamedly command the
attention of onlookers. So it may come as a surprise to learn that this
season, fashion’s must-have shade of the moment is decidedly more
understated: beige.

*HD* 	'I'm Addicted'; Why Food-Delivery Companies Want to Create
Superusers; DoorDash, Instacart and others want to turn casual customers
driven by discounts into repeat users who rely on their services regularly

Food-delivery companies are racing to convert customers first lured by
discounts into habitual, high-value users.

Their challenge, in part, is to wring more revenue from customers like
Jessica Knapik, a 31-year-old cosmetic tattoo artist in Detroit. She
already has a subscription to Shipt Inc.'s grocery-delivery service and
orders takeout from Grubhub Inc. or Postmates Inc. But while Ms. Knapik
is more than a casual user of food-delivery services, she says her
decisions about when and whether to order depend considerably on which
companies offer her discounts.

FOR Ateneo de Manila University management graduate Vikha Louise Vargas,
learning is a lifetime thing.

When she opened Loukha Clothing, Vargas made the bold step as she didn't
have any background on designing a clothing line. But there was no
turning back for the 2015 graduate: Vargas bucked the odds to push her
clothing brand for women belonging to the members of the millennial and
*Gen Z* generations.

MILLENNIALS are leading the way when it comes to business performance

A study of small and medium business owners shows 2018 was a more
successful year for Gen Zs and Ys than older Gen Xs and Baby Boomers.

IT’S been Australia’s unofficial anthem for almost 125 years. But Banjo
Paterson’s age-old classic Waltzing Matilda is winning a new generation
of fans.

The Sunday Herald Sun visited three Melbourne primary schools — Coburg
Primary School, St Finbar’s Primary School in Brighton East and
Caulfield Primary School — to play the song to grade 6 students and see
if the children of *Generation Z* recognised the tune about an itinerant
swagman. Almost all did.

from the Silent Generation to *Generation Z*, share the biggest issue

Myers Brown, founder of the Philadelphia Dance Company, says the Silent

When I think about the greatest issues facing women in the arts of my
age, the issue is succession, and also the fact that young people
disregard our acquired knowledge. So — who’s going to take our place in
developing the next generation of artists and creative leaders? How do
we find those people who are interested in the arts, and really want to
do the work?

Sometimes I teach classes at Drexel University, and the students sound
more interested in the pay and the position. I want to mentor someone
who is committed to the art form itself, or to the project. But they’re
more worried about the salary. After they spend all their money to go to
college, they want to find a way to pay it back. I get it. These
students are in a tough position. But the person I want to work with is
the person who is inclined toward making a difference, rather than
collecting a salary.

I think *Gen Z* women are growing up in an extraordinarily unique time,
one where smartphones track our every move on social media, targeted
advertisements are curated based upon our browsing footprints, and
Instagram and Snapchat act as our storytellers. This is the age of
social media, where content is constantly being created, uploaded, and
streamed in a matter of seconds.

EL PESCADERO, Mexico -- At a luxury resort in Baja California Sur,
everyone was recovering from a long day sharing how hard it felt to be
getting older.

Some of the participants walked pensively along the Pacific Coast at
sunset. Others read from the resort bookshelf, choosing from sections
labeled: ''What can death teach me about life?'' and ''What are the
unexpected pleasures of aging?''

A hate crime or an elaborate hoax involving a fading TV star. Tupac,
Snoop Dogg and getting high. These talking points have become de rigueur
discourse for presidential campaigns - because, apparently, engaging
with pop culture is the new baby kissing.

Pop culture and politicians have always been a dicey pair of dance
partners. One prefers the quickstep; the other, the waltz. That hasn't
stopped senators and presidential candidates Kamala Harris (D-Calif.)
and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) - youngish politicos trying to appeal to even
younger voters - from wading into the murky waters of cultural
commentary, with similarly mixed results. "Folks running for president
in the digital age are controlled by memes and discourse that takes
place online - it's faster," explains VaNatta Ford, an assistant
professor of Africana studies at Williams College in Massachusetts.
"They're really trying to engage with millennials and *Gen Z*."

3,275 million. It is the number of people who, in 2019, will have smart
mobile phones, or that Newzoo has predicted
(https://newzoo.com[https://newzoo.com]) in its '2018 Global Mobile
Market Report', where he estimated that by the end of last year there
would already be 3,000 millions.

Along the same lines, the MultiAtlas website
(https://www.comercios-electronicos.com[https://www.comercios-electronicos.com])
predicts that smart mobile devices will account for 80% of the global
use of the internet. This same page states that 50% of the time users
spend on digital media is through mobile applications.

*HD* 	What Investing In Stocks Tells Us About The Racial Wealth Gap

Anyone interested in investing in stocks can't help but notice the
current stock market is far different from what it was a generation ago.
But one aspect of that change, one that could help ease the stark U.S.
racial wealth gap, gets little attention.

Technology has thrown open many doors to the financial industry, once an
exclusive community of initiates, and decidedly white and male. Today,
virtually anyone with internet access who is able to scrape together
some cash and courage can jump into investing in stocks.

According to the Census of India, the rural literacy rate still stands
at just 69 percent, which is far below the world average of 86 percent

With the ever-growing population of the country, the future of India
promises to be exciting. Youth has the largest share in the demographics
of India, and that makes education the most vital sector for India.

Two teens – immersed in quantum computing and AI – say mentoring and
internships started their journeys in tech

The last 10 years have seen more breakthroughs in science and technology
than the previous 100 years combined. We believe the next 10 years will
be even more revolutionary. But for that to happen, our generation (*Gen
Z*) needs to be equipped with the tools and information required to
succeed and, most importantly, we need to see more of our peers,
especially girls, pursuing STEM learning to prepare for the future.

New research from CPC Strategy, part of Elite SEM - points to the need for brands to create an Amazon strategy to win the hearts (and wallet share) of the next generation 
 

SAN DIEGO, March 8, 2019 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- *Gen Z* is on track to
outnumber millennials, and they're poised to shake up the workforce and
the economy. New research from CPC Strategy, now part of Elite SEM,
finds that their values and motivations differ from millennials and
other generations, so what can brands do to appeal to this up and coming
generation? In recognition of International Women's Day, CPC Strategy
looked at the shopping habits of *Gen Z* women, from where they shop to
how they discover new products and what motivates them to buy.

'We have an army," Senator Edward J. Markey declared during a meeting
with the Globe's editorial board last month as he professed his faith in
the Green New Deal.

“There's a green generation out there," he stressed, touting the merits
of the resolution he announced alongside rising congressional star
Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

There was a time when I thought of Indiana's Republican lawmakers as
pragmatists. I didn't always agree with their ideas, but I appreciated
their consistent logic: Position Indiana to compete for business growth.

Back then, Republicans pursued reforms to streamline township government
and give parents more educational choices. They changed rules about
union membership and amended property tax collection. Their
leader-then-Gov. Mitch Daniels-embodied a no-nonsense logician, one bold
enough to declare a "truce" on social issues.

Naples, FL, March 08, 2019 --(PR.com)-- Nearly two-thirds of millennials

and stand for something. As customers demand a more personalised and
meaningful relationship with the brands of their choice, it is
imperative you have a clear brand purpose and if not, you reinvent your
strategy.

discuss how they ensure their marketing messages hit the right note with

Changing work dynamics, emerging global trade and industry demands have
drastically evolved the way workforce is managed across sectors.
Organizations of size across industries have employees of different age
groups and cultural background who are working together. Therefore,
managing a group of Gen X might be completely different from managing a
millennial or a *Gen Z*. As employees come with different skill sets,
experience and expectations, it becomes difficult for the management to
engage with all employees and assess their work with a common strategy
or technique. Additionally, there is a mix of workforce ranging from
permanent employees to contractual staff and consultants who work in
various capacities in many organizations. Therefore, managing and
overseeing such a diverse workforce has increasingly become difficult
without the intervention of technology.

Technologies Are Letting Customers Down – and How to Solve it. Based on
a global survey of 2,000 customer-facing employees by CITE Research,
including 500 in the UK, the report reveals that disjointed
communications technologies not only harm employee productivity and
morale, but also negatively impact customer satisfaction and the bottom
line.Customers have increasingly high expectations of good customer
experience and want to communicate with businesses through a variety of
channels.

From the gender wage gap to the so-called “pink tax,” symptoms of gender
inequality continue to affect girls and women throughout Canada and
around the world. Narratives around inequity often centre on the
financial and emotional burdens placed on adult women. However,
according to new data released by Plan International Canada to mark
International Women’s Day, the conversation needs to focus on the lived
experiences of girls transitioning into womanhood, particularly those
belonging to *Generation Z*.

According to the survey, gender discrimination begins to intensify for
young women before the age of 25. Nearly half of women in Canada said
this was when they first became aware of unfair treatment in their
schools and workplaces.

A lot of younger employees don’t save for retirement — so their
employers are doing it for them.

Every year that an employee delays retirement can cost large companies
as much as $3 million, according to Prudential research. Employers
already experience those financial consequences with baby boomers, which
is why many are stepping up their retirement savings efforts to prevent
the losses with younger workers.

THE author of the satirical "woke" Twitter feed of Titania McGrath, the
24-year-old "radical intersectionalist poet committed to feminism,
social justice and armed peaceful protest", turns out to be a man, one
Andrew Doyle, a stand-up comedian and polemicist. His fictional *Gen Z*
character is hilarious, even if in book form (published this week) the
parody becomes repetitive.

Doyle's clever barbs are particularly sharp when applied to modern
socialmedia-led activism, sniffing out "prejudice like valiant
bloodhounds of righteousness", he writes, "courageously snapping at the
heels of injustice".

- The office sisterhood is replacing the old boys club, as almost half
of women (48%) think it is important to have another female at work they
can talk to about tricky situations

- More than half of women (77%) aged 16-24 are bucking the traditional
work place dress code and would choose casual attire to feel most
confident. As *Gen Z* begin to climb the career ladder, they prove that
a woman's armour for success doesn't need to be suits and stilettos.

Not all products are brands. Most are commodities, driven by price and
challenged by customer attrition or lack of customer loyalty.

Kevin Lane Keller, a leading authority in brand management, posits that
products are brands if consumers are aware of them and have strong,
favorable and unique associations with them.

On virtual reality

With 5G coming in, 2019 will be the turning point technologically. And
everyone is talking about AI and 5G coming together. I think this is an
era of technology blossoming. 5G will allow higher download speeds and
it will give you a better experience at gaming with VR plus AR. We call
this MR or mixed reality and we are working with gaming companies. For
example, with a game like Harry Potter on 4G, the number of times you
can cast a spell with the wand maybe twice or thrice per second.

'We have an army," Senator Edward J. Markey declared during a meeting
with the Globe's editorial board last month as he professed his faith in
the Green New Deal.

“There's a green generation out there," he stressed, touting the merits
of the resolution he announced alongside rising congressional star
Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

anticipated that he would grow up to be one of today's most buzzed-about
drag entertainers and a contestant on the latest season of VH1's
RuPaul's Drag
Race[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/rupauls-drag-race-wins-best-reality-competition-program-emmy-award-2018-1144290],

gay was until I moved to America," the newly minted reality star tells
The Hollywood Reporter. "But here I am today — living my full fantasy."

Everyone knows the big shows. But what about the cities off the
stiletto-trodden track?

Fashion month is over after the showcase events in New York, London,
Milan and Paris. Where next? These cities are putting fresh designers,
sustainability and alternative cultures on the map:

Fashion month is over. Where next? These cities are putting fresh
designers, sustainability and alternative cultures on the map. By Flora
Macdonald Johnston Shanghai Number of days: 13 Number of shows: 75

Since its debut in 2003, Shanghai's fashion week has expanded to
accommodate the growing ranks of homegrown talent many living abroad
keen to show in China. New York-based Angel Chen, known for splicing
traditional, colourful Chinese brocades with luxury streetwear, has
shown here for the past three seasons. Opening Shanghai Fashion Week on
March 29 is London-based Xu Zhi, who has been named one of the finalists
for the inaugural Business of Fashion China Prize. Six finalists will
compete during the forthcoming fashion week, with the winner receiving
$100,000, BoF community mentorship and a show at London Fashion Week in
September. And watch out for *Gen-Z* Shanghai-based design duo Liushu
Lei and Yutong Jiang, founders of Shushu/ Tong. Since launching in 2015
they have been nominated for the International Woolmark Prize and have
amassed a global following including influencer Susie Bubble thanks to
their bold and exaggerated silhouettes. "China is our home market, as
well as our biggest market so it makes sense for us to show in
Shanghai," says Lei.

When it comes to sustainability and transparency, the fashion industry
has taken its share of hits.

While older generations may not have known about, or paid attention to,
issues like factory conditions, processing pollution, or the
decomposition time for synthetic fibers, younger generations are taking
note. Now, the conversations that were started by millennials are being
taken up and acted on by *Gen Z*.

Addressing gender issues in the workplace generally makes an employer
more attractive to workers but some workers are unmoved - or even put
off - by diversity initiatives.

More than one in 10 men (14 per cent) surveyed by SEEK said they were
less likely to apply for a role at a company with women in leadership
positions.

W magazine is getting closer to a sale and is said to be in talks with
at least one serious buyer.

C Ventures, the venture capital firm started about 18 months ago by
Adrian Cheng and Clive Ng, is thought to be in the lead to acquire W
from Condé Nast, sources tell WWD. While the current price is unclear,
the initial asking price was said to be around $8 million and
negotiations are thought to have brought the price down by around $1
million.

The first image of shoes that strikes the mind is either fabric or
leather, but the recent developments have brought a lot more into the
light. One such big entry, which has created riffles in the footwear
industry, is Merino Wool. An amazing fiber which was limited only to
sweaters, coats, and suits until a while ago.

About 55 per cent of working women say they are being held back from
landing senior jobs by the need for more flexible working arrangements.

Yet only 33 per cent of working men agreed that this was an obstacle for
women, found an Australian survey coinciding with International Women's
Day (IWD) 2019 on Friday.

When Core & Main, the largest U.S. distributor of water, sewer and fire
protection products, became a stand-alone company in 2017, Chief Human
Resources Officer Laura Schneider was charged with building an entire HR
function from the ground up. What had been a unit of HD Supply was sold
to New York private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, forming the
nearly $3 billion company. Schneider formed an HR team to build a
resilient department serving multiple locations, with not only benefits
and talent management, but marketing and communications, during several
rapid acquisitions.

When Verizon wanted to speak to viewers of the recent Oscars broadcast
in Spanish, ABC had to change its rules to make it happen. Now the
Disney-owned network is willing to do it again.

The telecommunications giant aired two commercials in the Oscars
featuring people speaking in both English and Spanish. Typically, ABC
would require subtitles for the Spanish portions, says Rita Ferro, who
oversees ad sales for all of Disney’s TV properties. No longer. “That
has been our policy and we are looking to challenge that, when we have
the right ad and the right partner, and potentially do things
differently,” says Ferro, president of Disney Advertising Sales, in an
interview.  She says that philosophy could apply to all the Disney TV

Don’t blame the denim market for Diesel USA’s trip to bankruptcy court.

Structural shifts in retail, high rents, changing consumer habits and
the convenience of shopping online have left many brick-and-mortar
retailers in bankruptcy — including Sears Corp., Nine West, Charlotte
Russe, David’s Bridal and most recently Payless ShoeSource.

Inside the Saxbys coffee shop at Drexel University, Alyssa Bennett, 21,
makes deposits, sets schedules, and pitches in at the latte machine when
the line gets long.

The third-year Drexel student is what the Philadelphia-based company
calls a “Student CEO,” referring to cafe executive officer. In locations
on or near college campuses in Pennsylvania, Washington, Georgia, and
New Hampshire, the coffee company hands over operations to a local
student for the semester, paying them above minimum wage to run the cafe
full time while also receiving class credits.

Technology that is driving businesses is also posing a challenge to the
entire ecosystem and leaders are facing what is now being called the
'Connectedness Paradox.' The ISA CEO Conference organised by
exchange4media will seek to find approaches to address this paradox.

Abraham Alapatt, Group President, Head - Marketing, Service Quality &
Innovation, Thomas Cook, who will be moderating a panel discussion on
'Winning the Consumer in the Connected World' at the conference,
elaborated on the challenges saying: "Business models are being
challenged - not just businesses. Thinking is being challenged - not
just individuals. Communication is being challenged - not just data
systems."

*GENERATION Z* are the most entrepreneurial age group, according to
recent research. While we all thought that millennials were the
trailblazers in terms of entrepreneurship, today's 16-24-yearolds knock
them out of the park. And they are 20 per cent more likely to want to
start a business than their parents.

What's even more interesting is the barriers they are pushing aside.

The timing of Goldman Sachs's new decree couldn't be more in step with
the current mood of men's style. In January, the City of London
Corporation declared that its formal City banquets need no longer be
black tie, and there has been a tectonic shift over the last decade in
what constitutes the idea of "formal dress", with suiting taken apart at
the seams and reinvigorated in a more dynamic way.

Studies in recent years show parcel delivery has become more important
to customers. In fact, poor delivery performance can cost you repeat
business, and possibly damage your reputation.

How is it possible to deliver more cost-effectively and responsively? It
requires a combination of digitisation and outsourcing, providing
greater control and protection.

Not any more. Young travellers are turning their backs on the country,

A NEW drive to entice '*Generation Z*' workers into Northern Ireland's
manufacturing sector could boost annual output by an extra £200m, a
report has claimed.

Manufacturing employs 10.7% of the workforce here, but shortages of
skilled workers is pushing up salaries by between 11% and 28%
year-on-year, according to Barclays.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc said on Tuesday that it is
relaxing the dress code for all its employees, a move once considered
unimaginable for the Wall Street firm’s leagues of monk-shoed partners
and bankers in bespoke suits.

The new “firm wide flexible dress code” was announced in an internal
memo, which said the shift was due to “the changing nature of workplaces
generally in favor of a more casual environment.”

RCBC's Digital Banking Group wins Silver Anvil

RCBC's Digital Banking Group won a Silver Anvil award for Debit Debates,
a pioneering financial literacy campaign that aimed to shift the payment
behavior of the millennial market from cash-based transactions to debit
card payments. The campaign became one of RCBC's most engaging &
well-received digital content of 2017. Through a series of short online
videos, RCBC highlighted the convenience and security one can get when
using RCBC MyDebit Mastercard versus cash in a witty and relatable way.
Ultimately, the campaign delivered impressive business results. The
Debit Debates campaign was able to increase debit card usage for
purchases three times by the end of the year.

We're about to get things started. The webcast is live. If you haven't
already, you can download the presentations on our Investor Relations
website. I think a few of you have been saying you've been able to do
that, so I was a little bit worried about the numbers doing it all at
