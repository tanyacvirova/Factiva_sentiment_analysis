MUMBAI: Over the last decade we've witnessed the field of marketing
transform in previously unimaginable ways. Much of this transformation
has been driven by the breakneck advance of technology, leaving
marketers struggling to catch up. But before the profession starts
pinning all its woes on these unprecedented changes, it's important to
take a step back and view the broader picture. Marketing has always been
at the very forefront of technological development and advancement.

Every era has seen the technologies of the day co-opted and put to use
in service of the profession, from SMS marketing of the 90s and media
buying during the internet boom, through to the more recent introduction
of social media marketing. If we are to stay at the top of our game, it
is our duty to remain constantly aware of new and evolving technologies
and their applicability to our sector. As such, these are the marketing
trends for 2020 that we expect will see the most traction:

On a sunny day last April, Anthony White, a 29-year-old Marine Corps
veteran, told a room of California state legislators how he had survived
a semester as a cash-strapped student at MiraCosta College: he'd slept
in his car.

''Educating *Generation Z*'' is such a large concept to encapsulate, so
I decided that the best approach would be to go broad. I wanted the
cover to communicate the idea of education simply and quickly, and I
couldn't get the image of a No. 2 pencil out of my head. I'm not even
sure if kids even use them anymore, but I know when I think about my
education, I think about that simple writing tool. Fortunately for me,
the letter Z has two large counterforms that somewhat resemble the tip
of a pencil coming in on an angle.

Complaints about rising college tuition are nothing new. But talk to
high school counselors, undergraduates or their parents, and you'll hear
a refrain repeated often: As tuition rises and incomes stagnate, filling
the gap between the two is becoming increasingly difficult.

Children like technology. They like playing games, watching videos,
finding music and interacting with their peers on social media. They
like exploring the endless resources of the internet. Educators notice
this and assume that computers and other devices will capture students'
interest in school. Ninety-three percent of principals and 86 percent of
teachers say that increased student engagement is the most important
benefit of using computers and tablets in classrooms, according to the
latest data from the Speak Up Research Initiative, which surveyed more
than 26,000 teachers and librarians and almost 2,200 administrators last
year. Nearly 70 percent of district administrators said they considered
engagement to be the most effective sign that a piece of educational
technology is useful.

Laurence Berland had just gotten out of the subway in New York, some
3,000 miles from his desk in San Francisco, when he learned that Google
had fired him. It was the Monday before Thanksgiving, and the news came
to him, bad-breakup-style, via email. ''Following a thorough
investigation, the company has found that you committed several acts in
violation of Google's policies,'' the note said. It did not elaborate on
what he had done to violate these policies.

In March 2014, Sean Caldwell went to the first Philadelphia rally for
the Fight for $15, the national campaign to raise the minimum wage and
to help fast-food workers -- who earn one of the lowest median wages in
the country -- form a union for the first time. Caldwell, an Army
veteran and college student, who was 35, had been working for nearly two
years as a janitor on the early-morning shift at a McDonald's in North
Philadelphia. Four days a week, he cleaned frying vats, unloaded
delivery trucks and mopped and restocked the restaurant. He made $8 an hour.

On your first day at a new job, do you: a) drink an Ensure and hang up
photos of your grandchildren while sitting quietly at your desk awaiting
instruction; b) arrive at work before the boss, in order to make a good
impression, but have difficulty figuring out how to turn on your
computer; c) wear a Sonic Youth T-shirt under your suit, kicking
yourself for working for ''the man''; d) send a picture of your new
participation trophies to the group text; or e) FaceTime in from your
couch while recording the meeting to upload to TikTok later? Answer
honestly: Your response will help your workplace determine which
generation you're from, what sort of worker you might be and how to get
you in the door at the company.

Ayear ago, I'd have probably spent this Sunday morning in bed, nursing a
hangover. Instead - rain or shine, hangover or no hangover - I'll be at
church.

I'm not just an atheist, but one who spent a decade preaching a gospel
of strident anti-theism. Yet I've started attending each week and have
found it transformative. And I'm not alone. Recent surveys suggest that
growing numbers of millennials and *Gen Z*'ers are seeking solace in
church - even if they don't believe in God.

India, Feb. 23 -- Kajol, who's basking in the success of Tanhaji: The
Unsung Warrior, says that she had to change her approach towards her
craft a few years back and incorporate a new method of acting in her
subsequent films. Looking back at her earlier years in the industry, she
says that she had to cater to the demands of her directors and ham in
order to play to the gallery as it was the only acceptable way of
performing. "We've all hammed back in the day. How do you think we would
get through? Hamming is terrible. It doesn't agree with your spiritual,
physical and mental aesthetics," she says.

Must Attend: Krishna as art

"Who better than him!" exclaims Harmeet Singh Sethi, Director, Aura Art
eConnect Private Limited, when asked the reason behind curating an
entire exhibition on the theme, Krishna - The Infinite. "A lot of work
has been done on Bal Krishna and his Mahabharata days, but Krishna is a
personality beyond all this. He doesn't just depict love, but also the
strength of balance, of taking decisions when it is difficult and
important to take one. He is an embodiment of godliness and
spirituality. He is the infinite," Sethi adds. The art house has put
together over 50 show in the last 11 years - both solo and group shows.
But "it is for the first time that our show is theme-based, and we are
planning to make it a series of four to five shows. When I was planning
this two years back, I knew Krishna's is such a diverse personality that
we can do it."

It is rather ironic that I am writing about inclusion being the future
of work. This shouldn't have to be the future; it must be our present.
Not just at our workplaces, but in the communities we build,
relationships we foster, and people we choose to become.

Teenagers used to aspire to become astronauts, firefighters, footballers
or pop stars, but times change and so do career goals. Today, more than
half of millennials and *Generation Z*-ers - those aged 13-38 - in the
US aspire to become social media influencers, according to recent research.

The Chinese viral video app TikTok is the platform of choice for young
people seeking to monetise their talents because it seen as rewarding
anyone's ability to entertain, whereas Instagram or YouTube tend to
reward those who already have celebrity status.

AURORA, Colo. (AP) — Thousands of 17-year-olds are eligible to vote in
Colorado's upcoming presidential primary for the first time under a new
state law.

The law allows 17-year-olds to cast ballots in spring primaries if they
turn 18 before November's general election. At least seven states and
Washington, D.C., have similar laws.

Every day, we’re reminded that intergenerational warfare is a real thing.

We’re told that baby boomers, Gen Xers, millennials, and Zoomers are all
going to cancel each other out and put an end to each others’ hopes and
dreams by voting for the wrong political party. While many of the
cultural fights these generations engage in are very much real, the
reality is that the market always finds a way to adapt as new
generations enter the scene, both to respond to different demands and to
accommodate workers offering different skill sets.

The world is in the midst of a crisis in the labour market. Talent
shortages are at all-time highs and unemployment rates don't drop
enough. Solutions are then required for the future of work and
employees. A Manpower Group study revealed that more than half of
companies around the world can't find the skills they're looking for,
nearly double what it was a decade ago. "As part of the jobs we do, we
see that there is a big gap between the skills that are required in
companies and those that people are trained with. In Colombia this also
happens, that is, 54% of employers worldwide, and also in this country,
they do not have how to find their talent," explained Javier Echeverri
Hincapié, president of ManpowerGroup Colombia. In addition, companies
are facing digitization and automation. Alongside this, most employers
in the world are increasing or maintaining their payrolls, but job roles
change faster and that's why we also have to work on attracting,
building and maintaining talent.

NEW YORK -- When Krish Himmatramka was working as an engineer in the oil
industry, he would spend his spare time in his trailer in northern
Louisiana scouring the internet for the perfect engagement ring for his
girlfriend. But he struggled to find one that was ethically and
sustainably produced.

After researching the jewelry industry, he decided to quit his job and
start the brand Do Amore, which means "I give with love" in Latin. His
girlfriend's ring - structured with recycled rose gold and an oval
diamond from Botswana - was one of the first Do Amore created.

Of Salvadoran descent, a professional in business administration and
extensive experience in the area of human resources and organizational
climate measurement, Lesslie de Davidovich is the regional general
manager of the Great Place to Work Institute in Central America and the
Caribbean for 13 years. It is an organization that recognizes the
efforts of companies that under their own models of culture and
organizational climate, are examples to follow as 'The best places to
work'. De Davidovich, committed to bringing to the regional level the
mission of building a better society, acknowledged in an interview with
The Panama Star,that being at the head of the organization as a woman,
has been her "biggest challenge". A great challenge that has gradually
been overcome by developing and transmitting to entrepreneurs that "a
good place to work positively impacts society".

Check scams are on the rise, the F.T.C. says, and many of the victims
are in their 20s, with little check-writing experience.

Fraud involving fake checks has mushroomed in recent years, and the
victims are often young adults, a new federal analysis found.

Young people flock to apps that let them chat with like-minded people

A breed of upstart apps is taking on an internet function that might
seem unneeded or even ill-advised: helping teens talk to strangers.

Branded as "social discovery" services, these apps pitch themselves as
alternatives to outlets that already specialize in online connections,
like Facebook and Instagram. They say they are better at helping young
users meet like-minded people outside their existing circles. And they
say they have safeguards, such as separating users by age and using
artificial intelligence, to protect against the inappropriate or unsafe
behavior that has plagued previous attempts to connect young people online.

Men dressed in hot pink suits sprinkled with glitter pinstripes and
animal print shirts covered in sparkling rhinestones twirled alongside
their female counterparts for the first time at this most glossy of labels.

What is the future of jobs all about and why does it seem confusing for
parents? One reason is that parents have to navigate raising their
children for a future that seems to change faster than ever before. Many
industries have changed and several jobs have been disrupted by
technology, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Robotics.
Below are some top secrets parents need to know about the future of jobs
and how it affects their children.

In 'How to Raise a Man', as you learn more about the development of
masculinity, identify your parenting style and familiarise yourself with
the issues facing parenthood today, you will become a more
compassionate, centred and effective parent.  In this era of #metoo and
#allmenaretrash, it's evident that something is going wrong with the way
men progress from childhood into adulthood, and few realise how critical
the role of the purposeful and emotionally empowered mother is in a
boy's journey to maturity. So, what does all this mean for you as the
mother of an adolescent boy? Like it or not,  mom, your son is
*Generation Z*. He has been  adored and treasured, photographed and
recorded. Many of his generation of adolescents are outwardly assertive
and outspoken and have good boundaries, yet inwardly they are full of
paradoxes. And they  are confusing to manage - your GenZ rules you.
 They are clever. But as a mother, you need to be smarter. Teenagers
need centred adults to guide  them.

This hue, which is neither yellow nor mustard, is a forever-favoured
Indian colour, and is receiving a lot of love by celebrities - on and
off the red carpet

This season, be ready to be enveloped by marigold mania. It's the 'IT'
colour for 2020, and B-Town ladies are clearly sold on it. While *Gen Z*
yellow (a subtle version of sunshine yellow) was a clear favourite in
2018, marigold is finding favour in fashion circles because of its
happy, bright and positive vibe.

Cos Have Difficulty In Seeing Brands From Point Of View Of Customer,
Says Neumeier

The second day of Star FLOW - The Change Festival, an initiative by The
Times of India - opened with the session 'The New Brand Model - Are you
creating Brands or Consumers?' by Marty Neumeier, director of CEO
Branding at Liquid Agency, redefining branding for marketers."I changed
it from being a logo, or a message or a campaign or a product to being
something else. A brand is a person's gut feeling about the product,
service or company," said Neumeier.

Adam Smith, the philosophical father of modern capitalism, may have been
Scottish, but his ideas have long found their muse in America.

Smith’s “voice has been ringing in the world’s ears for sixty years”,
wrote one observer in 1838, “but it is only in the United States that he
is listened to, reverenced, and followed.”

As Bernie Sanders rises, it’s not just the poor and the young who are
flirting with socialism — and the trend could continue here, writes Joel
Kotkin

Adam Smith, the philosophical father of modern capitalism, may have been
Scottish, but his ideas have long found their muse in America. Smith’s “
voice has been ringing in the world’s ears for sixty years”, wrote one
observer in 1838, “but it is only in the United States that he is
listened to, reverenced, and followed.” Yet today the US is shifting,
perhaps inexorably, in the precise opposite direction towards an embrace
of socialism. In the current race for the Democratic presidential
nomination Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-described “democratic
socialist”, has, according to CNN, taken the national lead – though
billionaire Mike Bloomberg has managed to buy his way into second place,
perhaps through sheer weight of money and name recognition.

RACHEL MARTIN: Latino and African American voters are about to have a
big say. The question is, how will they shape a Democratic primary that
is still very much up for grabs? The Nevada caucuses are tomorrow. And a
week later, South Carolina holds its primary. So what's on the mind of
voters in those two states ahead of this crucial week? We want to bring
in two guests who are on the ground. Political strategist Lauren Harper
was the South Carolina state director for Beto O'Rourke's campaign. She
is with us from that state's capital, Columbia. And Janet Murguia is in
Las Vegas. She is the president of UnidosUS. That's the largest Hispanic
advocacy group in the country. Janet and Lauren, thanks for being here.

LAUREN HARPER: Thanks for having us.

Instagram is becoming a go-to destination for consumers to
shop,[https://www.glossy.co/fashion/instagram-will-become-a-dominant-dtc-sales-channel-in-2020]
especially *Gen Z*. But with so many brands vying for attention, it’s
not always easy to convert customers.

*Gen Z* is known to be a mobile-first generation, growing up with
smartphones and social media platforms at their fingertips, but physical
retail is still a big part of how this younger generation discovers
brands and products. A 2018 study from Criteo found that 80% of *Gen-Z*
shoppers[https://www.criteo.com/news/press-releases/2018/06/criteos-gen-z-report-unveils-the-habits-of-the-new-generation-of-shoppers/]
look forward to going to physical stores, though 75% said they prefer to
make most purchases online.

Peter Lynch, as manager of the Fidelity Magellan Fund (FMAGX) between
1977 and 1990, rode masterful stock picks to outsize gains. FMAGX
delivered average annual total returns of more than 29% to fund
investors during his 13-year tenure, clobbering the stock market by over
13 percentage points. A $10,000 investment in Fidelity Magellan Fund
starting when Lynch took the reins would have grown to nearly $280,000
by the time he departed.

Lynch attributed his success to investing principles he shared in One Up
on Wall Street and Beating the Street. His overall strategy, based on a
few core concepts, is surprisingly simple. A few of the most salient points:

2020 FEB 28 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at
Real Estate Weekly News -- People spend an overwhelming share of their
lives at home or at work, and new Zillow research shows how decisions
about one are closely tied to the other.

The nation's renters, home buyers and home sellers overwhelmingly agree
on one thing: They want no more than a half-hour commute each way,
according to the most recent Zillow Group Consumer Housing Trends
Report. And many choose to find or create a home that enables them to
avoid the twice-a-day slog altogether by working from home at least some
of the time.

minutes. That song, "Break My
Stride,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4c_SkROzzo] has been featured
in films and commercials over the years and turned him into a one-hit
wonder.

Now, nearly four decades later, the song is gaining relevance for
listeners who weren't even born when it was first released, thanks to
its popularity on an unexpected platform:
TikTok[https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/21/tech/tiktok-app/index.html].

‘I broke my leg twice on the road in America,’ Yungblud is telling me,
flicking fuchsia-tipped black hair back and getting acquainted with the

Phone calls are the bane of my professional existence. Truth be told,
I’d often catch myself letting my phone ring while I pretend nothing’s
happening.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m not proud of it. And I only do it under specific
circumstances: I don’t know the caller, I’m sure it’s not urgent, I’m
incredibly busy. As it turns out, I’m not alone in this.

Onno Bouwmeister, Global Sector Head - Private Equity at Vistra, writes
an open letter to the PE industry about the major role it could play in
driving the ESG agenda.

As the great and good gathered at the 50th World Economic Forum in
Davos, Switzerland, earlier this year, there was one dominant theme on
the agenda – the climate crisis. From a damning speech by 17-year-old
climate activist Greta Thunberg, to panels featuring the C-suite of some
of the world's largest businesses – including the likes of Coca-Cola and
Dow Chemical – issues centred on the environment and sustainability
stole all the headlines.

Despite technology seeping into every pore of modern business and
transforming the landscape, there are still organisations that haven't
significantly changed or updated their onboarding processes. Traditional
forms of training such as mentor-based learning and lectures, as well as
early LMS modules and e-learning models are still somewhat of a standard
today.

While such methods may barely work for small businesses due to a more
hands-on approach, there’s a far higher margin of error for enterprises.
Not only is such training limited in a large-scale company but more
importantly, its content and timing are off the mark.

New Delhi, Feb 21 (IANSlife) From the rise of minimalist getaways to
vegan-friendly food experiences, travellers are seeking more unique,
transformative and unforgettable experiences they are willing to pay for.

As per a recent Airbnb survey, about 58 per cent of Indians prefer to
spend their money on experiences over things, and 65 per cent plan to
increase their spending on experiences in 2020, particularly women and
young adults.

Love Aaj Kal CLASSIFICATION: PG; 141 MINUTES Written and directed by
Imtiaz Ali Starring Kartik Aaryan, Sara Ali Khan, Randeep Hooda, Arushi
Sharma and Simone Singh Once upon a time, there was a director called
Imtiaz Ali who made pretty good Hindi films about young Indians finding
their roundabout way to love.

It's a testament to Ali's reputation that six couples of varying ages
showed up to a 10:30 a.m. show in Vaughan, Ont., on Valentine's Day,
braving the extreme-cold-weather alert. If they thought they would get
something better than Ali's last bomb of a film, Jab Harry Met Sejal
(2017), featuring a script so banal that even lead stars Shah Rukh Khan
and Anushka Sharma couldn't save it, they were sadly mistaken.

It first became obvious in November 2017 that the Victoria’s Secret
juggernaut was set to
crash[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/style/wake-weinstein-victorias-secrets-skimpy-undies-show-looked-hopelessly/].
The brand was holding its annual lingerie catwalk show in Shanghai, and
was already facing problems getting Chinese visas for both American and
Russian supermodels and the Western media, thanks to the controversial
nature of its show. I managed to go, to cover it for The Telegraph. Gigi
Hadid wasn’t so lucky...

Asian teens are more willing to shop online, but also feel strongly
about social issues according to a new study.

Some parents see it as a test of nerves, or at times, a sport: The daily
challenge of keeping connected devices like smartphones out of the hands
of their teenage offspring - or at least controlling their access to them.

KUALA LUMPUR: Bank Simpanan Nasional (BSN) registered more than 3.79
million depositors nationwide with savings of more than RM3.56 billion
for BSN Sijil Simpanan Premium (SSP) up to the end of December  last
year. BSN chief executive Datuk Yunos Abd Ghani said being the national
savings bank, BSN continues to carry out its mandate to encourage and
empower savings through BSN SSP. “The response to BSN SSP is very
encouraging. This year, we are hoping that the numbers will be better as
we introduced the Monthly, *Generation Z* as well as the Local and
Loyalty Draw to encourage more customers to save,” Yunos told the New
Straits Times in an interview.  He also said the bank had increased the
total value of BSN SSP’s prizes to RM23 million from RM22 million last
year. He said BSN SSP is the bank’s flagship product and had gone
through various phases of improvements to meet customer demands. BSN SSP
offers depositors a chance to win amazing prizes.

Leslie Wexner, the billionaire who turned Victoria's Secret into a
household name but who more recently has been scrutinized for his ties
to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, is stepping down as chief
executive of the retail giant he founded nearly 60 years ago.

Parent company L Brands is ceding control of the lingerie brand to
private-equity firm Sycamore Partners, the companies announced Thursday.
The roughly $1.1 billion deal comes as Victoria's Secret battles falling
sales and criticism that its provocative messaging is out of touch with
today's consumer.

New Delhi, Feb. 21 -- When you get to the stage that there are more
funerals and prayer meetings than birthday parties to attend, you know
that you have crossed the line that marks the declivity towards death.
At the after-meal at one such prayer meeting in the home of a close
relative, the post-lunch groups broke age-wise into huddles. While the
*generation Z* was in one room bent over their devices, each
communicating with other gen Zs, the over 70s were in another room,
heads close together. We, in-betweens, looked after both before our own
huddle. After two decades of work, the extended family has finally
accepted the fact that I might know a bit about money and finances. So,
I am summoned to the old gang to discuss Wills. "Monika ko bulao," rings
the command from the eldest silver. As I wade in, I find the group
divided down the middle. One set is vociferous in their pro-Will stand
and recommends handwritten Wills over an online standard format. The
other group looks suspicious.

Thailand's 56-billion-baht carbonated soft drink war is heating up, with
Pepsi and Est competing head-on to win market share.

Siremorn Supachanya, chief marketing officer of Suntory PepsiCo Beverage
(Thailand) Co (SPBT), the distributor of beverages under the Suntory and
PepsiCo trademarks, said the company is set to splurge 400 million baht
on a comprehensive campaign and promotional activities to boost sales
during the summer season, the peak period for the soft drink market.

LUCKNOW: Keeping fasts every Monday or visiting Shiva temples to pay
obeisance is passé for *Gen Z*. In the run-up to Mahashivratri, Young
Lucknow is making a beeline for tattoo parlours to get inked with images
of the 'Lord of the Youth’, wearing the rudraksha like a trinket, tying
man buns or embarking on spiritual treks to Shivagange, a peak some 54km
off Bengaluru.This new and versatile generation of Shiva bhakts
(devotees) has no gender barrier, says tattoo artist Amit Mishra. Both
boys and girls are up for popular inking themes — from full body
portraits and 3D designs to lines from the Mahamrityunjaya jaap, the
most sacred among mantras.“Appointments usually begin a week prior to
Mahashivratri. A lot of creativity and effort go into making these
tattoos, as religious sentiments are attached. A few years ago, only
boys came for these kind of tattoos.

HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW The Big Crunch, the catastrophic reckoning, is

The traditional video marketplace is no more. Driven by a combination of
technologies including high-speed internet access, mobile devices and
falling prices for high-resolution displays, television as we have known
it is undergoing a radical reinvention.

That's the share of 18- to 22-year-olds who say they feel lonely at
work, according to data published in the Wall Street Journal. The rate
was also high for millennials — 23- to 37-year-olds. Loneliness on the
job afflicted 69 percent of them.
