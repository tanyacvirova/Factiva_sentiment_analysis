This motherhood malarkey is a tough old gig. Raising 21st-century kids
is a bit like trying to understand the most sophisticated piece of
space-age technology when the only qualification you have is a C in
Standard Grade techie drawing.

Confession time: I'm not sure I'm the best at it, no matter what my lot
were kind enough to write on my Mother's Day cards.

In some ways, Apple News+, the company's new all-you-can-read news and
magazine subscription service, feels like the same idea that powered the
Kindle and even the original iPod. Take a bunch of physical things --
books or CDs -- and make them available en masse on a single device.

"To have your whole music library with you at all times is a quantum
leap in listening to music," Steve Jobs said of the iPod back in 2001.
So now you'll have a whole newsstand of magazines. Yay?

Teenagers are falling out of love with the idea of marriage, with shock
new figures indicating that only about half of them will ever walk down
the aisle.

Research by think-tank the Marriage Foundation in the UK predicts that
just 57 per cent of girls and 55 per cent of boys currently aged 13 to
18 will become a wife or a husband later in life.

*HD* 	The most shocking thing about 'Heathers' is how well it holds up,
30 years later

The premise alone seems unthinkable now: "Heathers," the 1989 cult
classic about high schoolers who plot to kill the cool kids, is riddled
with teenage suicide and gun violence as schools across the nation face
those issues for real in horrifying numbers.

But it's clear there's still an appetite for the twisted comedy starring
Winona Ryder and Christian Slater, which turns 30 on March 31.
"Heathers" has spawned a musical, an aborted television reboot and a
“Riverdale” episode in recent years, despite the wildly contentious
source material.

We can affirm that most Utahns are sane, commonsense people who are
exhausted by the Mueller investigation. They're also tired of the
never-ending fight over SB54 and Count My Vote. We contribute to the
fatigue by exploring, one more time, the impact of these issues on our
state. Last week, Gov. Gary Herbert vetoed SB123, which gave party
delegates control over naming candidates to run in a special election to
fill a congressional vacancy. This is a continuation of the fight over
SB54 and whether all voters, or just delegates, choose candidates. Will
the governor's veto be upheld, or will the Legislature override the
governor, putting power in the hands of party delegates? Pignanelli: "My
friends, no matter how rough the road, we can and we will, never
surrender to what is right." - Dan Quayle The idiom "bad penny"
describes an unpleasant or unwanted thing which repeatedly appears at
inopportune times.

YOU know when a pair of runners are really cool? And all the cool kids
and hip bloggers have them? And then they get so cool that they become
ubiquitous and the parents of the cool kids and hip bloggers buy a kind
of less-cool Clarks version of them? And the parent says to their kid,
"Look! we can match!" and the kid rolls their eyes because no one
actually cool has worn those runners for a year now? For some reason the
news that the Central Statistics Office (CSO) is testing a question
about sexuality for the 2026 census giving options of heterosexual,
lesbian, gay or bisexual put me in mind of exactly that.

DANCE of DEMOCRACYPolitical parties have discovered the virtues of
campaigning via Instagram ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Memes,
short explainer videos, cartoons and parody songs - the ruling BJP and
opposition Congress are pulling no punches on the photosharing platform
to reach out to millennials, the *Gen-Z* and first-time voters.

In the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, Twitter and Facebook played an important
role in social media campaigns. Political parties woke up late to the
influence of Instagram. All national political parties, barring
Congress, opened their official Instagram accounts only after the 16th
general elections were over. Congress posted its first picture on the
platform in March 2014. BJP started using the platform officially in
2015, followed by Trinamool Congress in 2016 and Aam Aadmi Party in 2017.

They may only be teenagers, but both have drawn worldwide followings for

Tasmanian households are throwing out the lowest amount of food in the
nation, according to a report.

Australians wasted $8.9 billion of food in 2018, which was a 7 per cent
reduction from the previous year.

Decades ago, Hollywood determined that the ideal teen heartthrob should
be tall, dark and handsome.

He should be around 6 feet tall, give or take a couple of inches. He
should have dark hair, preferably of the floppy variety. His smile — or
smirk, depending on the scene — should make young audiences swoon and
hope that someone like him asks them to prom in the spring. Think Jake
Ryan of “Sixteen Candles,” Patrick Verona of “10 Things I Hate About
You” or even Michael Moscovitz of “The Princess Diaries.”

CHICAGO -- Fast-casual chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc . and
Panera Bread are tapping the fast-food playbook as they grapple for
growth with old-school stalwarts like McDonald's Corp . and Burger King .

The latest evidence? The drive-thru window, a mid-20th century
innovation, is back in the limelight as chains competing for "share of
stomach" hone in on the convenience factor.

Commercial real estate honcho Stan Krawitz has been a bonanza for
Toronto men's dress-for-success charities. He has been culling his suit
closet recently, a collection that he had "invested in heavily," over
his three decades in business. The roster of 18 suits is now down to four.

Blame the techies. "It became absolutely obvious that showing up in
(Toronto's up-and-coming tech hub) Liberty Village in a suit and tie -
much less a dark suit and an institutional tie - was the kiss of death,"
says the vice-chair, founder and head of Canada for Savills brokerage.
"You'd get stares, and hear people asking, 'Are we being audited by the
CRA (Canadian Revenue Service)?' "

Curated Instagram accounts are creating a new platform for powerful
affirmations, writes Odessa Paloma Parker, and bringing vast communities
together in one place

When Nancy Pelosi emerged from a particularly gruelling conversation at
the White House last December, she was photographed wearing a
funnelnecked, tomato-red Max Mara coat. Her face pulled into a tight
smile, Pelosi's vibe was polished yet pissed off – the exact opposite of
Trumpian demeanour – and the next day, the Instagram account “Excellent
Coats on Irritated Women" was started by New York-based writer and
comedian Sara Benincasa.

*HD* 	Samsung Galaxy A30 and A50 are for *Generation Z*— people who are
at the heart of social media

The change in strategy in the last two years is clearly perceivable.
Earlier, Samsung was known to pack in every possible feature into its
phones irrespective of customer wants. The journey from being
all-about-specs to offering memorable experiences is not only helping
Samsung’s bottom line but it’s forcing competition to give their
line-ups more than a dekko.

If the company’s recent flagship launches — the Galaxy S10e, S10 and
S10+ — have been all about beautiful all-screen design, top-of-line
imaging, wireless charging with power sharing and ultrasonic fingerprint
sensor, the South Korean tech giant hasn’t been a miser while designing
the recent additions to its revamped Galaxy A series — the A30 and A50.
Of course, you may ask how these phones are different from, say, the
Galaxy M30, which is focussed on millennials.

The Galaxy S10 line celebrates a decade of Galaxy innovation with
incredible new features and award-winning technologies. But the first
thing consumers will notice when they see a new Galaxy S10 isn’t the
Dynamic AMOLED display or the pro-grade camera system—it’s the
eye-catching design.

(Bloomberg) -- Fast-casual chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc . and
Panera Bread are tapping the fast-food playbook as they grapple for
growth with old-school stalwarts like McDonald’s Corp . and Burger King .

The latest evidence? The drive-thru window, a mid-20th century
innovation, is back in the limelight as chains competing for “share of
stomach” hone in on the convenience factor.

In January 2018, things were not going well for Gisselle Hernandez,
founder of direct-to-consumer indie makeup company Glamlite. The brand,
which was founded two months prior, was having trouble finding its
footing in the competitive beauty landscape and among the *Gen-Z* and
younger millennial target consumer group.

It was then that Hernandez began designing a new product: the Pizza
Palette, an eyeshadow palette mirroring the shape of a pizza and
featuring 18 shades, like “Marinara” and “Prosciutto.” It took $100,000
to create the palette and cost three times more to manufacture and ship
compared to a standard eyeshadow palette, said Hernandez, who declined
to share the exact cost.

Having an opinion or voice on the pressing social issues of the day is a
must among most members of *Gen Z* and they want to associate with
brands who do the same.

Keeping this in mind, several brands have taken up the task of creating
awareness on social issues through campaigns on various platforms,
including the social media. Some of these include Ariel's #ShareTheLoad
campaign and Nike's #DreamCrazier.

TikTok is the first buzzy app to make me feel really, truly old, which
sucks for more reasons than the growing realizations that come with
aging: TikTok is simply unavoidable now. If you’re on Twitter, you
probably see the app’s Vine-like videos retweeted on your timeline at
least once a day. On Instagram, your friends have most likely posted
some of their favorites TikToks to their stories. The app is currently
serving as a sort of meme incubator,  producing videos and in-jokes that
become internet lingua franca in a matter of days, can turn songs into
overnight hits, and make celebrities out of pre-teens (as long as you’re
not, like me, too old to know what’s going on and to whom all pre-teens
look the same).

There would seem to be no connection whatsoever between a geo-based
online store selling random tchotchkes, a loophole in Denmark’s strident
sleeping-in-public law and the Scandinavian country’s growing homeless
population.

But here’s the link: a tabloid called Ekstra Bladet, which launched a
program this winter to help ease the suffering (and prevent potential
arrests) of homeless people by setting up virtual shops at physical
locations and drawing crowds to wait for their grand openings.

Everyone understands social media's importance, but with so many
options, how can a company answer the question "Where should this
content live?"

Will your efforts be most successful on Facebook? Or does the nature of
your audience warrant a second look at a newer platform like IGTV?

It’s tough sometimes to see ourselves as others see us. But that’s
exactly what happens every year when Deloitte issues its Commercial Real
Estate
Outlook[https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/real-estate/articles/commercial-real-estate-industry-outlook.html],
this year polling some 500 global investors on their views of everything
from technology to talent. Now, it should be said upfront that the poll
was a generalized view of commercial real estate as a whole, without
breaking out specific areas of focus, such as property management.
Nevertheless, it offers a glimpse worth considering.

If you’re tired of hearing about the talent deficit, which we’ll focus
on for this column, consider that this, in itself, might be part of the
problem. It’s clear, investors say, that an aggressive and often
policy-shifting attack on the issue of executive recruitment is called for.

Several local counties and communities were among the 189 recipients of
a combined $115 million in state matching funds for local road projects
through the Next Level Roads: Community Crossings Initiative.

To qualify for funding, local governments must provide local matching
funds, 50 percent for larger communities or 25 percent for smaller
communities, from a funding source approved for road and bridge
construction, according to an Indiana Department of Transportation release.

With a gothic-horror aesthetic and a fearsome melodic flair, Eilish has
inspired Nirvana levels of devotion among the world’s teenagers. So why
doesn’t she feel safe on stage any more?

‘I can’t even explain it to sound normal – I was in love with him,” says
Billie Eilish[https://www.billieeilish.com/], staring out of the hotel
window, her heavy eyes – usually filled with a look that says “impress
me” – now glazed over. She is talking at length about Justin
Bieber[https://www.theguardian.com/music/justin-bieber], saying that
“obviously” every girl her age – she’s 17 – had a Bieber phase, but that
hers was special. “Everything about me was about him, and everything I
did was for him. It was so miserable. It’s not a good feeling to be in
love with someone who doesn’t know you exist. I would sob all the time
because I loved him too much.”

Ever since James Dean, teenagers have been shown at odds with their
elders. But in today’s coming-of-age films, it’s the kids who must
rescue their future from adults

Kayla Day does not drink or smoke. She doesn’t talk back to her
teachers. The time the 13-year-old at the centre of the new film Eighth
Grade[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jul/11/eighth-grade-review-bo-burnham-elsie-fisher]
– played by Elsie Fisher – spends outside lessons is wholesomely
productive. She makes upbeat YouTube videos about how crucial it is to
be your most authentic self. (“Being yourself can be hard, and it’s
like, aren’t I always being myself?” she asks). But Day is also
isolated, menaced by self-doubt and subject to panic attacks. As such,
she is the perfect modern teenage heroine: the terrified voice of

Greg James has brought new listeners to Radio 1's breakfast show, with
his honesty about mental health. He talks to Guy Kelly

A little over 15 years ago, when Chris Moyles took over the Radio 1
breakfast show from Sara Cox, the legendarily modest DJ declared himself
"the saviour" of the entire station.

India, March 29 -- The ' Main Bhi Chowkidar ' blitzkrieg has stumped the
Opposition to the extent that the Chowkidar Chor Hai sloganeering has
found its equal match. With Prime Minister Modi's address to watchmen
across the country, the narrative being spearheaded by the Congress, and
actively peddled by other Opposition parties, has become a new theme
song. This strategic event was not just aimed at garnering favourable
optics - synchronised as it was with a strong action against Nirav Modi
- or to successfully dismantle the counter- narrative being pushed by
the Chowkidar Chor Hai campaign. Even in the short-term, the tactical
manoeuvre had far deeper objectives. But perhaps like most of Modi's
strategies, the Main Bhi Chowkidar crusade has been inspired by a
far-sighted vision that lies beyond the ideological realm and has the
potential to trigger a socio-political metamorphosis.

BJP's move to phase out octogenarian leaders from electoral politics has
created some unease within it. But actually all of India's political
parties should be moving in a similar direction. It's strange but true
that the departing 16th Lok Sabha is the oldest ever, with only 12 MPs
below the age of 30 making it past the post in the 2014 general
election. This is in jarring contrast to how over 50% of India is below
the age of 30.

Broad religious education in schools leads to greater awareness and
tolerance of Australia’s religious minorities.

A recent study by university researchers has found that the overwhelming
majority of Australia’s teens view religious diversity positively.
However, they found there is still a need to increase understanding of
and reduce prejudice towards religious minorities.

YES, your *Gen Z* wait staff are judging what you order for lunch,
because they see how much of it ends up as waste.

Researchers from Edith Cowan University surveyed *Gen Z* (born between
1995 and 1998) hospitality workers and 98 per cent believed customers
ordering too much food was the main driver of food wastage in the
industry. More than 7.3 million tonnes of food waste ends up in
Australian landfill every year.

MILLENNIALS are the worst offenders when it comes to throwing away food,
research suggests.

The report reveals that Australians wasted about $8.9 billion of food
last year, about $890 per household.But it is a significant improvement
on previous years, a reduction of $700 million from 2017 to 2018,
equating to a saving of $160 per household a year. *Gen Z* and Gen Y
were the worst wasters, binning more than $1200 in 2018, while Baby
Boomers binned $430 worth, the survey, commissioned by Rabobank, found.

Fewer than millennials and boomers, they're oft ignored

Their generation, they argue, has made countless societal contributions.
It produced Kurt Cobain and MTV. Gave the world the VCR, Nintendo, and
the Brat Pack.

2019 is the year the original recommendations of the Financial Advice
Market Review (FAMR) is set to be reviewed in full by the Financial
Conduct Authority (FCA), writes Simon Binney.

While we wait for the results of the assessment, it is worth reflecting
on the progress that has been made since the advice gap was called out
in the final FAMR report in 2016, which noted a gap that was
"particularly significant in relation to pensions and savings".

<th>When Chris Rackliffe, a motivational speaker in New York, met a
potential friend at a bar last weekend, it never occurred to him to
exchange phone numbers. Instead, the two swapped Instagram handles, and
have been liking each other’s posts. Rackliffe said they’ll probably
meet up in person again soon.

<th>“It’s so much more casual to give someone your Instagram handle and
keep in touch through stories and DMs,” Rackliffe said. “Swapping
numbers feels so serious and stiff nowadays.”

Almost half (48%) of employees have left a role because it wasn’t what
they expected it to be, according to a ThriveMap survey

Among *Generation Z* employees (those aged 18 to 24) this figure was
even higher, with three-quarters (73%) stating that they had left a role
because it didn’t meet their
expectations[https://hrmagazine.co.uk/article-details/two-thirds-in-hr-struggle-with-onboarding].

Banks have long struggled to provide an experience that effortlessly
works across multiple devices and provides the same service found in a
branch.

For every success story that comes from Bank of America, USAA, or the
recent reimagining of U.S. Bank’s mobile app, there are countless
examples of consumers unable to finish a loan application or open an
account online, forced to come into a branch to complete the process.

and 2014) made 14.6 billion restaurant visits in 2018. That demographic
accounted for 10% of all industry foot traffic.

Bangladesh, March 28 -- Almost suddenly, socialism has come to the
forefront of political discourse, on both sides of Atlantic, from the
background to which it was relegated as being irrelevant. After the fall
of Berlin wall in 1989, or to be more precise, after the dissolution of
the biggest and the most powerful socialist state in Soviet Union in
1991. Political historians and ideologues in the capitalist west gloated
at the turn of events in those momentous years, declaring the 'end of
history', meaning the worldwide entrenchment of liberal democracy after
the retreat of socialism in its bastion in eastern Europe stretching to
Soviet Russia. As a corollary to this, the unchallenged sway of
capitalism was also heralded in the celebratory outpouring of the Right.

It's time we forget that Ontario's government "for the people" has, so
far this year, announced their plan to remove primary school class
sizes, their plan to integrate kids who need intensive one-on-one
therapy into regular classrooms and, of course, their horrendous
post-secondary initiative to destabilize the lower income class as they
planned to attend higher learning institutions.

Forget the crumbling infrastructure that dozens of schools face.

If you bought shares of McCormick & Co. Inc. stock at last year's annual
shareholder meeting and held onto them until this year's event, you
would have seen an almost 40 percent return on your investment.

"What a remarkable run," CEO Lawrence Kurzius told a packed ballroom of
shareholders in Hunt Valley on Wednesday.

For about 30 minutes as shareholders streamed into the ballroom at
Martin’s Valley Mansion in Cockeysville for McCormick & Co.’s annual
shareholder meeting, a giant screen at the center of the room spelled
out one word in multi-colored letters: "future."

Lawrence Kurzius, the Hunt Valley spice maker’s chairman, president and
CEO, looked loose and relaxed as he touted 2018 successes for a room
filled with 1,000 shareholders that included a significantnumber of
company retirees.

The demographic change towards an ageing population in the developed
markets is a phenomenon that has been seen in recent decades, although
now, due to the increase of the living standards, emerging countries are
also joining that trend.

Marketers think they're doing a fine job at delivering a superior
customer experience. Consumers don't agree.

A new study by the Harris Poll, commissioned by Redpoint Global, shows a
large gap between the two groups.

job responsibilities, 42% pointed to the working environment and 35%
mentioned working hours or shift patterns.

BOLOGNA, Italy — It’s testing times for makeup suppliers. In the recent
past, they have seen the pace of their category’s sales slow, following
years of meteoric rise, and the skin-care segment becoming far and away
the fastest-growing beauty category.

“Last year we went through an unexpected change,” said Dario Ferrari,
founder and president of Intercos, the world’s largest color-cosmetics
maker, whose top line suffered in 2018. “We try to understand why.”

There appears to be a disconnect in how retail marketers and consumers
view the current state of customer experience.

According to a new survey of more than 3,000 consumers and 450 senior
marketers in the U.S., U.K., and Canada, marketers (34%) are nearly
twice as likely as consumers (18%) to believe brands do an excellent job
delivering an exceptional customer experience. The survey was conducted
by The Harris Poll and commissioned by RedPoint Global.

More than 100 consecutive months of job
gains[https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm] have contributed
to a unique employment environment, one where, for the first time in
recent memory, organizations have found themselves struggling to attract
the workforces they need to succeed. As the talent war has intensified,
more human resources managers have turned to recruiters, but with so
many staffing agencies to choose from, how can companies know which are
best suited to their searches?
