Foodstuffs general manager of marketing and customer experience, Dominic
Quin, is rather accustomed to being the customer experience custodian
within organisations he works for. And it’s work that’s required him to
wear many hats – from marketing to technologist, digital transformation
leader, product manager, customer custodian and growth driver.

Having stepped up from marketing to take the digital reins at New
Zealand’s largest company and world’s biggest dairy producer, Fonterra,
for example, he oversaw the unification of experiences under what was
internally called ‘digital 1.0’. The work involved fusing together an
ecosystem of digital technologies that importantly, could fuel cohesive
customer experiences whatever the channel of engagement.

The dreary workplace described by Dolly Parton is fast becoming a thing
of the past

FOR YEARS, workers have resented the 40-hour working week. The iconic
title track of Dolly Parton's movie, now a high-profile West End
musical, shines a light on these frustrations.

The Window of the World in Shenzhen in February Photo: VCGWhen it comes
to amusement parks, China's *Generation Z* prefers big international
attractions like Universal Studios and the fairytale magic of Disney
resorts. But once upon a time, domestic tourists were enchanted by theme
parks that could whisk them around the world in an afternoon with their
miniature replicas of foreign landmarks.

As the amusement park market has grown and more Chinese travel abroad,
tourists are increasingly bored by ersatz Eiffel Towers.

India, Feb. 28 -- The bar scene in India is finally getting upgraded. It
has moved past the heavily coloured cocktails and mastered the old
fashioned one, it is now entering a phase where innovative drinks are
the norm instead of being yearly specials. Rather than just being
fixated to whisky, millennials are now experimenting with their drinks,
without having to necessarily stick to boring regular Mojitos. The bar
is no more just a corner in the restaurant where alcohol and syrups mix,
but has evolved into quite the star of the evening with specialists
being brought in for conceptualisation.

The rising trends of cocktails seem to be the cutting edge post-modern
and post molecular techniques such as there's an equipment which is
typically used to clean diamonds, it is now being utilised to mix cocktails.

In person, rising Chicago rapper Calboy is quiet and reserved,
thoughtfully choosing his words in conversation before he fully commits
to opening up about his story. But when he hops on stages throughout the
U.S. on his first headlining tour, which kicked off Feb. 8, he exudes a
youthful energy that grows explosive when he performs his Billboard Hot
100 hit, “Envy Me.” Says the 19-year-old: “I've got music in my soul.
Ever since I can remember, music helped me through everything.”

Consumption now accounts for over half China’s economy, but spending is
decreasing

Jiang Rong has always been firmly in charge of her family’s household
finances. But in recent years the 44-year-old teacher admits her
disciplined attitude to spending has slipped. “I spent unthinkingly,”
says Ms Jiang, recalling purchases of Japanese cosmetics and South
Korean shampoo. “Money would flow away like water.”

Executive Summary

President of Lloyd's North America, Hank Watkins sees potential for
workforce diversity behind the oft-cited statistics about the aging baby
boomers retiring from their jobs in the insurance industry. "Older
workers can extend their careers by learning new tricks of the trade
from the millennials and Gen Zers. Younger workers can gain perspective
on the industry's foundation from older colleagues while applying their
digital prowess via disruptive technologies," he writes.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Country singer Jimmie Allen likes to tell a
story about the first time he met songwriter J.P. Williams, who is
blind, before they came up with Allen's No. 1 hit single "Best Shot."

"I said, 'I don't know if anyone told you, but I'm black,'" Allen said.
"'So keep the black jokes to a minimum.'"

There’s a new video platform in town: TikTok. As with the arrival of any
new platform the burning question for marketers is what role TikTok will
play in a strong video content strategy.

TikTok blends Musical.ly’s focus on music with a priority on snappy and
entertaining videos. The app currently has 500 million monthly users
while Musical.ly had a user base of around 100 million, aged mostly
between 14 and 20.

Baby Boomers rate their work/life balance as much poorer than younger
generations

Almost half (49%) of Baby Boomers (those born before 1965) believe their
work/life balance is between average and very poor, according to
research from Hays. This compared to almost two-thirds (63%) of
*Generation Z* (those born after 1995) rating their work/life balance as
being either good or very good – surpassing all other age groups.

EXCLUSIVE: As the $71.3 billion Disney-Fox deal nears the finish line,
there is a steady earner that often gets overlooked among the assets
that will remain behind as part of Fox Corp.: MyNetworkTV.

The programming service, launched with fanfare in 2006 as a bid to
counter the emerging CW, had to regroup not long after its debut. Its
ambitious slate of English-language telenovelas failed to gain traction,
the economy was souring, and MyNetworkTV stations were anxious about the
trajectory of their advertising revenue as the country entered a
financial crisis.

New Delhi, Feb. 27 -- A vast majority of Indian schools have already
come to realize that students need to become responsible, inclusive, and
global to meet the challenges of the future. Sustainability and global
citizenship, which were once thought of as optional choices, are now
becoming the new standard, as the entire world moves towards becoming
more sustainable, inclusive, and equal, and the same is being reflected
in school practices and pedagogies.

What sets *Generation Z* apart from other demographic cohorts? For
retailers and fashion brands, *Gen Z* can be found perusing the clothing
racks in a brick-and-mortar retail store — and spending more money than
Millennials, according to a new study released today by LIM College.

As patrons of all types of physical retail, be it department,
fast-fashion, neighborhood, thrift and outlet stores, Gen Zers are
shopping “more frequently and are spending more on fashion than
Millennials,” according to researchers at the college.

NEW YORK, Feb. 27, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- According to the results of a
recent LIM College survey, *Generation Z*, in contrast to their
predecessor generational group, Millennials, likes shopping in stores
more than online. They also patronize all types of "brick and mortar"
retail destinations--department, specialty/fast fashion, neighborhood
and outlet stores--more frequently and are spending more on fashion than
Millennials spend.

When asked, "If you were given a $1,000 gift certificate and were to
spend it on one product or service category, which would it be?", 40% of
the *Gen Z* respondents said they would buy apparel and accessories.
This compares to just 23% of Millennials.

HomeEquity Bank eschews labels to smash age-related stigma, and portray
Boomers exactly how they view themselves - as positive, adventurous and
capable!

TORONTO, Feb. 27, 2019 /CNW/ - Recent marketing campaigns are the latest
example of how companies and brands are pushing boundaries and facing
complex social issues head-on in to connect with consumers. But while
marketers are making important progress in reducing gender and ethnicity
bias, age stereotypes are stubbornly pervasive. Boomers and aging
populations are either ignored or portrayed as helpless, frail or
fumbling - tired typecasts that are inaccurate and considered offensive
based on how this demographic views itself today.

Teen rapper's raucous show offers about what you'd expect -- maybe a
little more

In the lobby of the Garrick on Monday night, a young woman with tiny red
lights along her eyelash line unknowingly walked by the management team
of 15-year-old American rapper Danielle Bregoli — a.k.a. Bhad Bhabie —
who deemed the look worthy of a FaceTime call to Bregoli backstage.

In an ad titled 'Har Ghooth Mein Swag', clearly designed to target
millennials, Pepsi recycles 1950s funda of jeans as a symbol of rebellion.

There is no garment as widely embraced, loved and worn as denim 'Jeans'.
What was once considered a classic symbol of the American West is now a
staple in everyone's wardrobe. In the 19th century, jeans were first
manufactured as workwear for labourers of America's Western states. With
time people adopted them as casual wear. They then became a symbol of
rebellion - the spirit captured by the likes of Marlon Brando in 'The
Wild One' (1953), and James Dean in 'Rebel Without a Cause' (1955).

Paul Frantz, industry director at Google, shares three things app
marketers can learn from *Gen Z* dating trends

I’VE SPENT much of the last seven years helping companies adapt to
demographic shifts as baby boomers began retiring and Gen X and
millennials became the primary focus of marketers. But in demography, as
in marketing, change is the only constant. And today a new generation —
86 million strong and with money to spend — is beginning to enter the
workforce.

The Latest: On February 22, 2019, Kraft Heinz took a USD15.4bn
write-down of the goodwill value of assets for Kraft and Oscar Mayer,
two of the company's core brands. It also revealed to its investors that
it had received a subpoena from the US Securities and Exchange
Commission in October 2018 related to its accounting policies and
internal controls. In Kraft Heinz's financials for FY18 (ending December
2018), operating income also entered the negative territory for the
first time since Kraft Foods and Heinz merged in 2015. Operating income
fell by over 250% y-o-y, dropping from USD6.1mn in FY17 to an operating
loss of USD10.2bn in FY18. In Q418 (quarter ending December 2018), the
company reported operating losses of USD14.1bn in contrast to the
operating income of USD1.5bn the same period the year before.

We underline three key reasons for Kraft Heinz's write-down of its core
brands and its poor financial performance:

American Eagle has joined the subscription club and, thus, the growing
share economy.

The retailer has quietly rolled out its own subscription service, Style
Drop, which it has been testing on its website in a limited manner.

Body Shop is refocusing product, stores and activations around

Jadian Toros' "big break" has been an experience which lived up to the
hype, while the excitement is set to continue as Bajillionaires hits the
tube this weekend.

Toros, an 11-year-old from Kitchener, was elated to talk about his
experience filming the Family Channel show with the Waterloo Chronicle
on Feb. 25, and it was clear his outgoing personality played a part in
his role of "Zeke" on the new show, which is about kids forming a
startup company out of their garage. The group of kids looks to one day
change the world with an exciting invention.

Several great initiatives came from
agencies[https://www.adweek.com/agencies/what-agencies-are-doing-to-encourage-discussion-reflection-and-celebration-during-black-history-month/]
to support and celebrate Black History Month, and upon closer
examination, Goodby Silverstein & Partners’ new Talk Shop series merits
watching.

The series was born from GS&P Voices, an agency diversity and inclusion
initiative that was created as a platform for minority groups to have
unfiltered discussions about life and work. While other seemingly
uncomfortable internal agency discussions around race,
diversity[https://www.adweek.com/agencies/on-the-adweek-podcast-real-talk-about-race-and-advertising/]
and inclusion are generally kept in-house, it’s refreshing to see GS&P
put talent’s point of view out there for all to see.

Founding an Agency as a Woman of Color

I interact with the C-suite of many agencies in role. That’s how I met
and came to know Danielle Austen, founder and CEO of fluent360. What’s
interesting about her story is the multiple diverse intersections
represented: an African-American female founder and CEO whose agency has
a unique partnership with a holding company and who possesses a long
track record of success. In honor of Black History Month, it felt like a
great time for her story to be heard.

Stacey Hightower: Danielle, there are as many origin stories as there
are businesses operating, but your agency’s origin story is very
interesting for many reasons. You saw a gap that needed to be served,
but were also offered a partnership with a holding company if you could
prove your thesis. Can you tell us that story?

The Coca-Cola Company veteran Sabrina Tandon is proud of her brainchild
Bar Nøne, a new line of cocktail-inspired, nonalcoholic bottled drinks
from the Atlanta-based beverage giant that comes in four flavor options.

The new drink line was born out of The Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO)
venturing and emerging brands wing, where Tandon works as the director
of portfolio strategy and innovation. Tandon said she came up with the
idea after realizing there is a segment of people who want to sip on
nonalcoholic drinks in social settings, and she doesn't see the trend
slowing down anytime soon.

There are now over 400 direct-to-consumer (DTC) brands that have
collectively raised $3 billion in capital since 2012, according to an
Inc.
article[https://www.inc.com/magazine/201805/tom-foster/direct-consumer-brands-middleman-warby-parker.html].
These DTC brands have built and sustained successful businesses largely
through social media advertising on platforms like Instagram and
Facebook, but that's now changing.

There's more competition than ever among both DTC and large brands, and
social media platforms, with their ever-changing algorithms that hurt
viewability and deplete brands financially with diminishing returns.

Employers and HR teams are managing employees for a workforce that
stretches across three to five generations. This workforce is complex,
and its workers have varying needs from generation to generation. That’s
why a multigenerational benefits strategy is in order.

Baby boomers preparing for retirement may have an ongoing relationship
with doctors and a number of medical appointments in a given year. On
the other hand, millennials and members of *Generation
Z*[https://www.benefitnews.com/opinion/5-myths-about-gen-z-workers] —
the latest generation to enter the workforce — may shy away from primary
care doctors and focus more on options to pay off student loans and
start saving for retirement.

At five years old, North West, the famous daughter of Kim Kardashian and
Kanye West, has captivated the digital realm with her cross-generational
appeal. Without a public Instagram or YouTube channel of her own, she’s
too young to fully understand what a digital footprint is. And yet, hers
is already wildly popular.

We’ve watched North West grow on Instagram and “Keeping Up With the
Kardashians” and magazines — here, she poses for her first solo cover.
Her distinct fashion sense belies her age, and lately, so does her eye
for makeup.

Now that hemp is legal, analysts at Cowen & Co. expect the plant will
grow into a $16 billion opportunity for companies like Canopy Growth
Holdings (ticker:CGC), Tilray (TLRY), and the little tobacco product
seller Turning Point Brands (TPB)—all stocks that Cowen already rates as
Outperform. The broker has led the way among U.S. firms in covering
cannabis, and Monday morning Cowen put out a 100-page report on hemp by
11 of its analysts.

Hemp is the cannabis cousin that contains cannabidiol, or CDB, but not
the stuff that makes you high, which is THC (or if you must,
tetrahydrocannabinol). In December, President Donald Trump signed a bill
that removed hemp from federal narcotics
prohibitions[https://proxylibrary.hse.ru:2556/articles/cbd-to-see-a-boost-with-hemp-legalization-51544549958]
and allows states to regulate the product. That cleared the way for
truckloads of consumer products containing CBD, which has analgesic and
relaxing effects, but no buzz.

There's a unique perk for those moving into the newest housing
development in Franklinton.

Kaufman Development[https://livekaufman.com/] has launched a partnership
with Columbus-based startup Rhove Inc.[https://rhove.com/] to offer
tenants at its soon-to-open Gravity development off Broad Street a "Rent
to Earn[https://medium.com/rhove-blog/rhove-with-us-e7c2d164afba]" tool
that will match tenants' savings up to 2.5 percent of their rent, while
employing other tools to help them prepare for homeownership.

What should beauty brands do to attract a *Gen Z* audience? Focus on
social media, reviews and free samples, according to Chegg.

Mitch Spolan, Chegg’s executive vice president of marketing services,
invited four college students to join him in a panel discussion on their
beauty spending habits. The women — named Kim, Jen, Jada and Elisa —
were selected from Chegg’s research pool of 18,000 college students.
Prior to WWD’s Forum, they provided Chegg a cumulative 10 hours of video
footage of them shopping online.

NEW years bring new challenges. Given 2019’s accelerated pace thus far,
the trials you face this year may be your toughest yet.

What’s a business to do when consumers trust strangers online more than
brands they know? How can leaders keep their composure when they’re
under more stress than ever? Increasingly complex challenges in AI and
machine learning, the rise of blockchain, *Gen Z* demands for a more
diverse workforce -- is it possible to handle all this and stay sane?

Comment

Justine Greening last year argued that “you can’t do Brexit to young
people, you’ve got to do it with young people.” But with Brexit
negotiations, or a lack thereof, continuing to dominate the political
landscape, young people are becoming more disengaged with mainstream
politics than ever before.

For those who conclude their careers in this 2019, the good just begins.
And is that the university students belonging to the so-called
*Generation Z* could have the key to adapt to life after graduation,
thanks to its opportunistic mentality and its upbringing full of
options. Contrary to the "post-graduation depression" that is supposed
to affect the almost graduates, David Díaz, a student of Audiovisual
Communication at the University of Seville, said he felt at the best
moment of his life. With 23 years and a semester of completing his
studies, David works as a reporter on the Spanish network WinetTV, where
he covered the Goya Awards 2019, and is about to start his own program.
Norman Ramírez González, specialist in clinical psychology, said that it
is inevitable that university students experience a period of
uncertainty, after leaving the routine.

Let’s nerd out for a minute. Do you know where the term “software patch”
comes from?

Some of our younger readers might be surprised to know that, in the old
days, users were literally required to cut and paste code to keep their
computers updated. And I do mean literally.

The oldest of *Generation Z* (aged 12-22) is just entering adulthood and
will have a profound impact on the packaged food and foodservice
industries, yet will be the hardest audience for food marketers to
reach, predicts market researcher The NPD Group.

*Gen Z* has never known a world without the internet and is the
generation most likely to embrace mobile food apps to place food orders
than older generations, said The NPD Group, which has just put together
a report
[https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/infographics/2018/feeding-the-growing-appetite-for-restaurant-apps/]
on mobile food ordering apps.

Younger generations are often characterized as entitled and demanding —
but that self-confidence in their work is pushing companies to adopt
benefits outside the traditional health care and retirement packages.

By 2025, millennials will make up 75% of the U.S. workforce, according
to a study by Forbes. The first wave of *generation Z* — millennials’
younger siblings — graduated college and entered the workforce last
year. With these younger generations flooding the workplace, benefit
advisers need to steer clients toward innovative benefits to attract and
retain talent, according to panelists during a lifestyle benefits
discussion at Workplace Benefits Renaissance, a broker convention hosted
by Employee Benefit Adviser.

As *Generation Z* prepares to enter the workforce, businesses are
quickly realizing that email alone just won’t be enough with today’s
digital savvy employees. This is why, many organizations have begun to
invest in a variety of collaboration tools and project management
software. However, with this influx of new software, it has becoming
increasingly difficult for teams to keep track of important company
information as well as to know how to contact staff members when they
need them.

Keeping up with customer-service expectations in the digital age takes
more than tech know-how. Especially when the customers are young,
tech-savvy “sneakerheads” who want tomorrow’s shoes today—or even yesterday.

To meet that challenge, Foot Locker Inc. is focused on analyzing huge
amounts of data, innovative digital marketing—and speed.
