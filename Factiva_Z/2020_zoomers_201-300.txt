DISNEY+ UK launches tomorrow and now a new poll has revealed Britain's
most nostalgic Disney movies.

Back in November, the House of Mouse’s streaming service Disney+ finally
launched. However, the new digital platform was only available in
certain regions and not Britain. But Disney+ UK is finally launching
tomorrow and a new poll has revealed the nation’s most nostalgic Disney
movie.

[https://www.bwconfidential.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/boots-covent-garden-beauty-concept-store-300x225.jpg]How
retailers can better attract consumers to color in their stores

The downturn in make-up means retailers need to do more to entice
consumers into stores. This has seen stores pay closer attention to
their assortment. Consultancy WSL Strategic Retail ceo Wendy Liebmann
comments: “We are seeing retailers be very careful in terms of what they
keep and what they get rid of, of what’s selling and what’s not, and how
they can hone the category so it’s more efficient.” She adds: “They are
also bringing in more of their own or exclusive brands to create some
interest if there is not a product innovation to play.”

There are days when it seems that all I do is prod my teenager to get
out of bed, get out the door on time, get on with that homework
assignment and, for crying out loud, put away that laundry we folded
last week.

I don't love the sound of my voice when it's nagging and I know he
doesn't either.

These are unprecedented times for all of us. And frankly, we're all
trying to figure out how to deal with our new lives, even if we know it
will only last for a while.

These strange days mean normalcy is not an option, for the safety of us all.

Television used to be simple: a handful of channels, a TV listings guide

big tech woke up to a new means of delivery: piping on-demand TV and

The outbreak of Covid-19 has enforced students to tarry at home but the
*Generation Z* has adapted the online mode of communication with
teachers to keep up with learning. Teachers & parents are well connected
on WhatsApp groups. Smart phones, are bracing teachers to prepare short
videos on different concepts and subjects that are further uploaded and
reaches students.

Worksheets & diagrams in coherence with the video are sent for
recapitulation and revision. Powerpoint presentations appended with
audio notes are sent across grades for comprehensive approach. Language
teachers (French, Spanish & Japanese) are attuned to video conferencing
for engaging children with real time learning. As a closure of each
chapter or concept different e-resources are provided to the children by
Extra marks and on YouTube. Skype sessions function as an aid for
revision, assessment and remediation.

For the first time, millennials and *Generation Z* have enough electoral
clout to seriously compete with their elders. But many feel more
disillusioned than empowered.

The oldest of them were just out of college on 9/11; the youngest were
not yet born. Over the two decades that followed, they all came of age
under storm clouds: of war, of recession, of mass shootings, wildfires
and now a pandemic.

True Tales of Quarantined Socializing

Where once technology was thought to be the death knell of human social
interaction, it is now bringing us together under quarantine. The
housebound are nimbly pivoting to virtual social gatherings.

Not taking the threat of COVID-19 seriously and “disconnected from
reality” is how one Perth *Generation Z* has labelled her peers in the
face of the global pandemic.

Olivia Bartlett, above, said she was concerned her generation was
defying social-distancing recommendations from the Federal Government
and health officials and boasting about their lack of care amid the
coronavirus crisis. From mourning about their European Contiki trip
being cancelled, to continuing social outings, Ms Bartlett said
flattening the curve of infection was a “community effort” and it was
time digitally-driven *Gen-Z* tuned in.

business meetings, check-ins with grandma and grandpa and get-togethers
with friends all conducted with a device, a Wi-Fi connection and often
with one platform suddenly booming in popularity. NBC`s Jo Ling Kent has

BACKGROUND Mountain View is a leading Egyptian real estate company whose
vision and mission have always centred on developing the land and
spreading happiness among those around us”. It is a partner of the
Delivering Happiness (DH) organisation – a US-based coaching and
consultancy firm that has worked with Google, Facebook and Dubai
Government among others – and the official DH parent in Egypt. As well
as applying DH principles to its own headquarters, Mountain View
factored DH principles into its new international business hub
Heartwork. With Cairo’s urban sprawl and economic growth, corporations
are looking to expand and upgrade in New Cairo’s commercial zones and
new office parks, the market traditionally competes over per-meter
prices and location. As more and more millennials and *generation Z*
enter the workforce, the traditional fancy yet cold work places are
becoming out of touch with the new world.

Reeling from the coronavirus shutdown of a wide swath of business
sectors across the country and the globe, the advertising industry
stands to lose billions of dollars as advertisers big and small pull
back on their marketing campaigns.

But advertising will play a key role in the recovery once the crisis
abates, and a new survey from the Association of American Advertising
Agencies makes the case that advertisers still have a vital role to play
in buoying the economy and consumer confidence in the days ahead.

In an analysis of online search traffic of the top global retail and
fashion brands during February, as the coronavirus outbreak was peaking
in China, researchers at SEMrush found a surge at sites such as the
U.K.’s “Amazon alternative” Onbuy.com and French men’s wear site Celio.com.

These sites beat out traditional retail fashion leaders such as
macys.com and online giant Amazon, who have consistently drawn robust
year-over-year online search growth.

DR OZ has told Americans to “close the borders” of their homes to stop
the coronavirus outbreak, urging families to wash clothes that have been
worn outside and to quickly discard delivery packaging.

With the virus spreading rapidly across the country, the TV host and
Columbia University physician also said that cities like New York, Los
Angeles and Seattle should be shut down.

The other night my friend Margot called. It’s not unusual for me to hear
from Margot — we’ve been friends for more than 30 years, email
frequently, have dinner every month or two, and I stay over at her house
whenever I’m in town. But Margot never calls. Practically no one does;
my few surviving telephonic friendships antedate the internet. But
Margot has a cold, and because her husband is immunocompromised, she’d
had to quarantine herself in their guest room; she was, in effect, the
invalid mother confined to her room upstairs in some Victorian novel.
She’d been just about to email me when she thought, why would I email?
and picked up the phone.

Once I’d ascertained that it wasn’t an emergency, her call was a
pleasant surprise. We talked for half an hour or so, and it cheered us
both in a dark, uncertain time.

Features | As emo heavyweights My Chemical Romance and Paramore singer
Hayley Williams return, James McMahon examines the past – and future
– of rock’s most sensitive subculture

Presuming plans go ahead as scheduled, the next few months look set to
be a hell of a party for emo, the shorthand misnomer for rock music’s
most introverted subsect. After a seven-year hiatus, poster boys for
modern emo, My Chemical Romance, are playing stadium shows again in
June. Opening for Green Day on their global tour are scene veterans Fall
Out Boy and Weezer. And Hayley Williams’ forthcoming solo album, Petals
For Armor, made during her time out from the multi-platinum band
Paramore, looks set to propel one of the genre’s most celebrated artists
even further into mainstream consciousness.

UK household insurance gross written premiums fell by 4.9% in 2018 to
£6.2bn, says GlobalData

Generation rent is an impeding factor on the household insurance market,
with start-ups and some incumbents now offering flexible renters’ cover.
Under the backdrop of a decline in UK household insurance gross written
premiums (GWP), which fell by 4.9% to £6.2bn in 2018, this transition
within the market creates a harder environment for insurers, who will
likely see combined policies decline and a rise in cheaper landlords’
and renters’ policies.

As David Attenborough approaches his 94th birthday, he finds himself on
a very different planet to the one he grew up on. We need to reconnect
with nature, he tells Nick Rufford, for our own health — as well as the
Earth's

After a lifetime of bringing nature into our living rooms, David
Attenborough wants us to get out of our armchairs and help save the
natural world we've enjoyed watching on television. Decades of
relentless industrialisation, urbanisation and intensive farming have
driven a wedge between us and our animal ancestors, he warns, and the
disconnection between modern families and nature is getting worse.

Generation X craves happy hours and yoga class as much as anyone but
insists it can recapture a time before all that

Is Generation X — the legion of latchkey kids for whom the waning Cold
War still forced futile school drills — better able to self-soothe under
the confines of a coronavirus quarantine than *Gen Z*, millennials and
baby boomers?

Love it or hate it, fast fashion is the great success story of the
contemporary apparel industry, with a value system centred around
inclusivity, representation, gender-neutrality, body positivityand
racial equality. But as thethe visual virtual world tightens its grip,
fast fashion's future may not be as unwavering as it initially appears.

Unlike any other sector, fast fashion retailers have not only scaled and
multiplied but have figured out how to harness technology to cultivate
relevancy in an industry currently void of consumer loyalty.

EVERY day the battle between the generations seems to rage harder than
ever. Baby boomers are demonised, millennials mocked, and poor old
Generation X is stuck in the middle.

But what sets the generations against each other? From Brexit to pop
culture, it seems the age gap means we just cannot agree about anything
anymore. Why? What is it that defines each generation? What makes them tick?

As the world has been gripped by the coronavirus pandemic and the
unprecedented halt to public life, moments of pure joy, however brief,
have become even more precious than usual. Perhaps that’s why a series
of short videos known as “Vibe Check” — originally posted to TikTok by
Brigham Young University senior Daniel Spencer — became a sensation
earlier this week after NBC News reporter Kalhan Rosenblatt posted some
to Twitter.

The premise: An individual or entity is summoned to the “House of Vibe”
for a “vibe check,” a kind of trial for someone’s offenses to social
decorum and good sense. Spencer, 26, has put everyone from a woman
hoarding toilet paper to right-wing gun rights advocate Kaitlin Bennett
through a vibe check, but rather than trying to describe these videos
any further, just watch some for yourself:

Last year, cannabis kingpin Andrew Modlin — co-founder of marijuana
juggernaut MedMen — paid $11 million for a brand-new mansion in L.A.’s
Bird Streets neighborhood, high in the hills overlooking West Hollywood.
And with no longer any need for his “starter” house down in prime WeHo,
he soon listed the blocky contemporary structure and recently unloaded
it for $3.9 million, the same price he’d paid back in 2016.

The striking home’s new owner is Bay Area native Emma Chamberlain, the
18-year-old YouTube wunderkind who has risen from obscurity to become —
in less than three years — one of the world’s top influencers, a
relatively new brand of *Gen Z*-propelled celebrity that is sometimes
dismissed by older generations as having less than “legitimate” fame.

Many of us were hit and in some cases it was the only option, but not
all of us were prepared. So, out of the blue and because of the
coronavirus pandemic, several Chileans had to test for the first time
the experience of telework (also called remote work or home office), a
modality that in the US and Europe has years of use, but that in Chile
is still found in diapers.

But there is interest in this modality. According to Google Trends, a
tool that reflects the degree of google searches, Chilean users began to
become aware of the new situation just this weekend, being the
Metropolitan, Valparaiso, Magellan, O'Higgins and Maule regions who
searched the related terms the most. The most recurrent queries in this
case have to do with their implementation, the bill, and "slack", one of
the most used tools in the business environment.

From crowded bars in South Boston to spring break beaches in Florida,
throngs of young people have treated the coronavirus as a curiosity, an
inconvenience, or a petty nuisance that cannot puncture their shield of
invulnerability.

Even after Governor Charlie Baker and counterparts in other states shut
down restaurants, closed pubs, and limited public gatherings to 10
people or fewer, many Americans in their 20s and 30s stuck to early
thinking that older people are much more at risk.

Christian Louboutin has built a business on being in step with trends.
Baby steps, perhaps, given the tallest of his designs teeters at almost
8in, but the man who turned high heels from wardrobe staple into
personality type has a good track record of knowing what it is that
women most desire. So it was surprising to hear him in Paris last month
sounding so thoroughly out of sync.

"I don't want people to look at my shoes and say, 'That looks
comfortable,'" he told guests at the private view of his new
retrospective. "When I design, I don't think about comfort."

Classic 501-inspired jeans prevailed as a favorite among Hollywood stars
this winter. Gigi Hadid, Hailey Bieber and Katie Holmes were among the
famous faces who wore the style throughout the season, pairing it with
cozy coats and knits. Zoe Kravitz nailed the effortlessly cool look with
a glittery top and pair of worn-in straight-fit jeans.

Young starlets also experimented with wider fits. Shailene Woodley wore
Stella McCartney’s mom jeans with front seam details. Hailee Steinfeld
stepped out in drapey wide-leg jeans with a self-tie belt. Musician Dua
Lipa added a *Gen Z* twist to the roomy bottoms by pairing her jeans
with trendy chunky sneakers, and Selena Gomez styled her oversized jeans
with a boxy blazer.

Millennials have flocked to veganism over the past 20 years. *Gen Z* is
carrying on the plant-based baton, leaving brands selling non-animal
products struggling to adapt to their expectations.

Studies suggest around 80% of Gen-Zers expect to consume fewer
animal-related products in the coming year, over 30% intend to be on
entirely meat-free diets by 2021 and 44% think being vegan is cooler
than smoking. But *Gen Z*’s culture and attitudes surrounding
plant-based products are very different than those of their elders, and
what’s resonated with Millennials isn’t going to cut it with a new
generation of consumers for whom the availability of non-animal-based
products is expected.

In an exclusive interaction with DQ Channels, Vivekanand Manjeri, Brand
Director, Client Solutions Group, Dell Technologies has talked
about workforce transformation and the role of technology as an enabler
in today’s workforce scenario.  Please tell us about the
multi-generational workforce and how workforce transformation can enable
and empower them The workforce of today is an interesting mix of four
different generations working together across different roles and
responsibilities. While millennials mostly enter the workforce with high
tech literacy and knowledge of the evolving technology landscape, Gen X
and baby boomers have great knowledge of the soft skills needed to
succeed in a corporate environment. They act as mentors to Gen Y as they
learn the nuances of innovative technologies such as VR, AR, MR, etc.

*HD* 	How brands are adapting to the expectations of an increasingly
vegan generation

Millennials have flocked to veganism over the past 20 years. *Gen Z* is
carrying on the plant-based baton, leaving brands selling non-animal
products struggling to adapt to their expectations.

Studies suggest around 80% of Gen-Zers expect to consume fewer
animal-related products in the coming year, over 30% intend to be on
entirely meat-free diets by 2021 and 44% think being vegan is cooler
than smoking. But *Gen Z*’s culture and attitudes surrounding
plant-based products are very different than those of their elders, and
what’s resonated with Millennials isn’t going to cut it with a new
generation of consumers for whom the availability of non-animal-based
products is expected.

Genderless fashion is rapidly going off the charts globally and in India
as well. Celebrities like Ranveer Singh, Rajkummar Rao, Vicky Kaushal,
Ayushmann Khurrana have made fashion statements in their recent red
carpet events with attires that rewrite the rules of gender based fashion.

From bold and unusual pairings to bright colour suits, florals to draped
silhouettes, the trend is catching up. Many Indian fashion houses like
Smoke Wear, NorBlack NorWhite and Huemn have also adopted the 'gender
fluid' clothing concept.

Gone are the days when people held onto their prized possessions in
their closets, stocked up their closets with expensive, rarely-used
outfits. The days where you could boast of having a wardrobe full of
unused or stacked up clothes is passe' now.

The buying population which was once dominated by Boomers have now been
replaced by younger age groups. These customers have a modern mindset,
they are conscious of what they buy and whom they buy from.

2020 MAR 27 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at
Economics Week -- The Fram^ and Gemme partnership is at the intersection
of fast-growing digital businesses and the increasing demand for
sustainability and greater social consciousness in emerging categories.
Fram^ delivers leading digital and technology services to support rapid
company growth and digital development. Gemme provides an intuitive
consumer-to-consumer clothing rental service.

The Gemme model doesn't require production of new fashion, which makes
everything that happens on the platform more sustainable. Other rental
services own their inventory and still put orders to fashion brands,
which drives production. Fram^ have supported Gemme to have new smart
ways of working sustainably and are now a driving force behind making
the 'end-of-ownership' and the 'sharing economy' a reality for people in
Stockholm.

To make it an attractive proposition to the investors in the state,
Telangana Govt. offers skilled and trained entry level resources through
TASK, without the investors incurring recruitment and training cost as
well as benefit from a workforce that is productive from the first hour
itself, says Shrikant Sinha, CEO, Telangana Academy for Skill and
Knowledge (TASK), Government of Telangana, in a conversation with
Sudheer Goutham of Elets News Network (ENN).

The Government of Telangana has announced 2020 as ‘the year of
Artificial Intelligence (AI)’ and the World Education Summit also
revolves around emerging technologies in AI. Can you please tell us
about TASK’s initiatives on a similar theme and how it is moving forward??

Video conferencing apps are flourishing during the pandemic as all else
around them wilts and wanes

Eric Yuan appears in front of London Bridge under a cloudless, but
flickering, blue sky. “I thought I’d use a British background,” he says.
With a click of a mouse, the landmark vanishes, giving way to a magnolia
wall with a painting and a bookshelf. “Sorry it’s a bit messy”.

Having been "raised by the Internet," YouTube sensation Conan Gray
started out on the site as a 9-year-old vlogger.

"The first video that I put up on YouTube was of my pet gecko," says the
now 21-year-old Gray, who went on to post more clips of "my friends or
random things I would be doing. It was my diary - an extremely public
diary."

‘Imagine if you or your loved ones were diagnosed with a deadly flu strain?'

This is actually a quote from a book I wrote, Your Money or Your Life!
The question that followed, was not: ‘What would you do?' The question

There are days when it seems that all I do is prod my teenager to get
out of bed, get out the door on time, get on with that homework
assignment and, for crying out loud, put away that laundry we folded
last week.

I don't love the sound of my voice when it's nagging and I know he
doesn't either.

It's not easy growing up in one of the world's most famous families, so
Noah Cyrus put her trauma into song

When Noah Cyrus first started seeing paparazzi pictures of herself in
the tabloids, she was 11 years old. It was 2011, and her pop star sister
and former Hannah Montana star Miley was among the top five most Googled
celebrities in the world, her father Billy Ray Cyrus was one of
America’s most famous country
stars.[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/country-stars-rap-old-town-roadlil-nas-x-return-black-cowboy/]
By the age of 13 she was reading weekly headlines about her physical
appearance; by 17 she was diagnosed with clinical depression and body
dysmorphia.

We are entering the era of voice and businesses must rush to implement
voice-activated technologies to remain relevant and competitive.

Just as 2010 was the year that mobile-first technology took hold, 2020
will be the year of voice-first technology. Alexa and Siri have found
their home in households across the globe. As more consumers turn toward
smart speakers to make their lives more convenient, Amazon’s
voice-activation devices now control around 70 per cent of the US market
share, with close to 100 million units in American homes.

* Lunar is a weekly curated selection of news, interviews and features
dedicated to celebrating women in Asia and sharing stories that matter

Chinese photographer Luo Yang spent most of 2019 trying to capture a
generation that is as talked-about and embedded in the culture of
sharing as it is mysterious to those outside of it. Her latest series,
"Youth”, explores *Gen Z* subjects from Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong,
Taiwan and other parts of China.

Young adults are giving up

in 2018, so it was perhaps only a matter of time before financial health

For the first time, the editors of the Cavalier Daily — the student
newspaper at the University of Virginia — were having to plan out their
issue via webcam.

The screen jumped from face to face Monday as the young journalists,
many of whom had returned to their childhood homes after cases of
covid-19 cropped up across the state and school officials urged everyone
to leave campus, ran through a long list of stories. They were covering
the school's first infection, the concerns over how students in rural
areas would access online classes, and the question of whether tuition
would be reimbursed.

up-ends how we live our lives

RIGHT now, the priority for all countries must be to confront the
immediate challenges of the coronavirus pandemic: ensuring access to
healthcare, maintaining the flow of essential supplies, and managing the
economic fallout that risks seeing businesses and individuals devastated
through no fault of their own.

Are you a doomsday prepper? Are you ready if the COVID-19 pandemic turns
into a worse-case scenario that has all of us clinging to a wing and a
prayer? It's tough to imagine. This is not meant to induce panic, but to
introduce a new survey by Finder.com that asked 1,200 random Canadians
across the country if they are prepared to handle the worst if it comes.

The pandemic has certainly spawned a lot of weirdness - strange polls,
bizarre talk-show segments, wild rumours and new slogans - amidst the
legitimate concerns of the average Canadian, including those living
beyond the anonymity of big cities.
