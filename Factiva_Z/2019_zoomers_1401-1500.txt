It’s a tough time to retain your best employees.

Wages across all disciplines are increasing, which is resulting in
competitive new job offers and making it difficult for employers to
staff and retain top talent (unless they can regularly dish out
significant raises company-wide). Most employers compensate for their
potential wage discrepancy by offering employees attractive, affordable
and comprehensive benefits programs.

Research points to vast differences between Millennials and *Generation Z*

SAN FRANCISCO and NASHVILLE, Tenn., Jan. 15, 2019 /PRNewswire/ --
*Generation Z*, which is comprised of today's youth and young adults,
has received little attention compared to the Millennial generation.
Yet, those in *Generation Z* are among our youngest consumers, students,
colleagues, constituents, voters, and neighbors. Being able to better
understand who they are and how they see the world can be helpful in
effectively working with, teaching, supervising, and leading them.

One of the first profile pictures I ever posted featured me, front and
center, with a Yoda backpack hanging from my shoulders, a Freddy
Krueger-inspired sweater, a pair of baggy blue jeans, and a look on my
face that said “undateable.”

It’s adorable, and I only came across it, buried deep in my Facebook
gallery, thanks to a movement that caught on over the weekend. The
“glow-up challenge,” as many have dubbed it, asks people to post one of
their earliest Facebook profile pictures alongside their current one.
It’s a cute, though slightly narcissistic challenge, especially for
those between the ages of 24 and 29. Teenage awkwardness is adorable and
a near-universal experience. In our 20s, most of us are much more
composed than we were while going through puberty.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 15, 2019-- 

Wibbitz, the leading online video creation company, today released the
findings of its new research How to Reach Audiences with Social Video:
From Millennials to *Generation Z*, revealing the difference in
preferences, habits, and consumption of video on social media between
the two most influential generations. Wibbitz surveyed more than 1,000
people between the ages of 18-22 (*Generation Z*) and 23-37
(Millennials), reporting that *Generation Z* is watching 3.4 hours of
video each day while Millennials watch 2.5 hours. Both groups are
spending more time watching video than reading articles, but *Generation
Z* is spending a significant 70 percent more time on video. As
*Generation Z* matures and gains purchasing power, media companies,
brands, and agencies must understand how to reach the next generation of
consumers through their preferred medium--video.

DETROIT – Nissan says it has seen the future and it is, of all things, a
sedan.

As the U.S. market continues to go bonkers for trucks – pickups, SUVs
and crossovers accounted for nearly 70% of light-vehicle sales last year
– Nissan says its forecast shows future buyers want four doors, albeit
with a higher ride height, and previews its interpretation of it with
the IMs EV elevated sports sedan concept car.

We should really have a better reason to go back to Roswell, New Mexico.

CW's latest remake, due Tuesday (9 EST/PST), is based on the 1999-2002
series that aired on WB and UPN, which in turn stems from the "Roswell
High" books by Melinda Metz about aliens living secretly in the infamous
southwest town. It follows this season's "Charmed," a remake of the
1998-2006 WB series about three witch sisters, not to mention "90210,"
"Dynasty" and "Melrose Place. "

Condé Nast is heading into 2019 ready for change. This past fall, the
legacy magazine publisher unveiled a five-year modernization
plan[https://digiday.com/media/conde-nasts-turnaround-plan-faces-hurdles/]
focused on diversifying revenue, then saw the person who delivered that
plan to its board of directors, Bob Sauerberg, step down as CEO.
Provided it sticks to that plan’s script, Condé will lean even more into
short-form video, events, audience data and creative services for its
advertisers.

We spoke to Pamela Drucker Mann, Condé Nast’s chief revenue and
marketing officer, to discuss Condé’s future and what it will offer to
advertisers. The conversation has been condensed.

They are often accused of being careless with money and frittering it
away on luxuries such as avocado on toast and pricey tumeric lattes.

But now, a report has claimed that millennials are actually saving more
for their retirement than the next oldest generation.

Amy Zhang, age 21, knows her parents would like her to get her driver’s
license. They’ve been on her about it for some years now. And while the
college senior from Vienna, Va., readily admits that she could get it,
she just hasn’t gotten around to it yet, what with coursework and
extracurriculars and internships taking up most of her time. 

“I do plan on getting my license,” she says. “I’ve been planning on
getting it so long that it’s funny.”

The reasons I'm stressed out are your reasons, too: too little time, and
even less money. Deadlines. Relationships of all types. Aches and pains,
insomnia. The general state of the world. It's all a bit much, isn't it?

I could use a drink. Not that kind of a drink. No, the drinks I've found
myself chugging as if I were a college freshman on spring break don't
have any booze, but they do have adaptogenic mushroom powder. Or
cannabidiol, commonly known as CBD. Or L-Theanine.

From Russia to Armenia to Belarus there has been a surge in online
justice campaigns. And it’s making a difference

An exciting wave of innovative activism is emerging across the former
Soviet Union. I work for an organisation that supports civic
activists[https://praguecivilsociety.org] and I see a new energy,
self-belief and creativity that defies the pessimism permeating western
debates about civil society in the region.

One of every three physical books sold in China last year was purchased
on
Tmall[https://www.alizila.com/tmall-success-a-talking-point-on-company-earnings-calls/],
according to the Alibaba Group-owned B2C online marketplace, with
Millennials driving the bulk of those sales.

In a report on China’s reading habits released last week, Tmall said it
had sold 1 billion physical books last year, the equivalent of a third
of all books in the retail market. Tmall found that about 80% of the
platform’s book-buyers were born after 1980, the year at which the
Millennial
generation[https://www.alizila.com/post-millennials-a-surprising-growth-factor-for-tmall-global/]
began.

Lightfleet Corporation (www.lightfleet.com[http://www.lightfleet.com])
has both issued and pending patents that will lead to the first
implementation of true multicast networking on a multicore processor
chip. This solves a fundamental problem that has limited the performance
of processor architectures in data-intensive applications. Multicast
refers to the ability to send a data packet to multiple destinations
simultaneously. This is a capability that is desirable in
performance-critical applications where multiple processors need access
to the information.

According to thepaper.cn, the coach of a famous South Korean esports
team Kingzone DragonX said that South Korean esports have generally
regressed. He also said that China will catch up and surpass South Korea
in esports in a short period of time.

The coach was right. The inspiring progress of Chinese esports not only
reflects Chinese young people's enthusiasm for the game, but also shows
China's younger generation's pursuit of technological development.

Education has always been one of the most significant steps in our
lives. We face it from the very beginning and continue to the very end.
Our life is rushing forward and changing every day, and so do people.
Yet, does the education system keep the same pace? Unfortunately, it can
hardly be defined as one of the most progressive spheres of life. Thus,
it is the responsibility of *Generation Z* to put an end to the old
standards of education and pave the way for a better future.

What is *generation Z*?

SINGAPORE: There is a reason why cab drivers are often referred to as
taxi uncles.

Most are of an older generation and a huge proportion remain men. There
is no data to back this but, anecdotally, in my last 10 taxi rides, all
of them fit this category.

A corner of Bhavan's College in Andheri has been turned into a United
Nations for animals. Baptised as the Bhavan's Nature and Adventure
Centre, it has guinea fowls and ball pythons from Africa; budgerigars
and emus from Australia; Muscovy ducks, natives of Mexico; a German
shepherd, a Tibetan mastiff, and a St Bernard, all the way from the
Alps. "In that sense, we are a cosmopolitan nation," says administrator
Himanshu Prem Joshi.

Headed by Joshi, the centre is a sum of several parts: one section is a
rescue centre, where abandoned and injured birds can flock together and
receive TLC; another is a green cover with over 300 types of plants,
including rare trees such as rudraksh and kailashpati, medicinal plants
such as aloe vera and tulsi, and a vegetable patch of palak, methi,
ajwain, lemongrass, brinjal, papaya and carrot; a third is an obstacle
course with a rock-climbing wall, commando net, Burma bridge, zip line
and ropewalk.

WASHINGTON — When Sheryl Connelly was growing up in Metro Detroit, she
worried that the ease of newfangled power steering was going to lull
Americans into oblivion.

“I had this vision as a little girl that there’d be a bunch of drivers
that were sleeping behind the wheel,” said Connelly, the in-house
futurist for Ford Motor Co.

In coming decades, consumption growth and the Fourth Industrial
Revolution will create tremendous opportunities in the emerging Indian
market. In 2018, extensive proprietary research was conducted on India,
the world's largest democracy, and among the world's fastest growing
economies.

The World Economic Forum's new report, titled Future of Consumption in
Fast-Growth Consumer Market - India, identified key forces that will
shape consumption in India and was a call to action for
multi-stakeholder collaboration to build an inclusive future for the
country.

As midnight approached, a blacked-out people carrier drew up outside the
Wright Venue in north Co Dublin. Out stepped Rihanna, in the same dress
she'd worn on stage before 14,000 fans less than an hour earlier. It was
May 26th, 2010, and one of the world's biggest pop stars had come to the
€38 million megaclub - situated in a retail park bristling with car
dealerships and DIY stores - for her aftershow party.

Hosting Rihanna and her retinue was obviously a coup for the Wright
Venue and its owner, restaurateur Michael Wright. The Swords club had
opened amid glittering fanfare in July 2009 and, notwithstanding the
half-hour drive from the city centre, was building a reputation as the
decompression spot of choice of celebrities passing through Dublin.

As video content distribution evolves, new generations of consumers are
shaping business strategy in ways boomers and Generation X never did.

Speakers during a Jan. 9 streaming video panel at the annual Consumer
Electronics Show agreed that *Generation Z*, the youngest generation
just now arriving at consumer age, are native to streaming video, and
their comfort with the streaming platforms requires new means of engagement.

High-end watchmaker Daniel Wellington makes time for customers, allowing

payment provider aiming for a turbulent takeover in the U.S. alternative
payment space, while revolutionizing the payment experience.

With already 100,000 merchants including Asos and Topshop, Klarna is
Europe’s “leading payment provider” and a newly licensed bank operating
across 14 countries. Daniel Wellington is a Swedish watch brand known
for elevated, minimal designs with more than 2,000 stores worldwide.

This year's most talked-about Chanel launch is not fresh off the

The Boy de Chanel make-up range, launched in Korea in September last
year ahead of a global release this month, offers men a small range of
beautifying products. They include concealer, foundation, brow pencils
and a lip balm, all with mattifying properties.

On a hot summer holiday afternoon, Holy Spirit Primary School is,

their families, at home tending to their summer reading pile or making
new friends at the pool.

But walking through the deserted school grounds, energetic little voices
and 8-bit video game music can be heard from one computer classroom.

Global solutions provider CGS said today that sustainability is driving
demand and customer loyalty, according to its newly released 2019 U.S.
Consumer Sustainability Survey. CGS surveyed more than 1,000 U.S.
individuals, aged 18 and older, in regard to how sustainability impacts
their buying preferences.

Two-thirds of respondents said they consider sustainability when making
a purchase and will pay a premium for sustainable products, according to
the report. And while cost is always a primary consideration, the
company found that “consumers are putting an emphasis on sustainability
and are also increasingly focused on shopping with brands whose mission
they care about.” Interestingly, but not surprisingly, conscious
consumerism resonates most with *Gen Z* shoppers, as 68 percent have
made an eco-friendly purchase in the past year and 50 percent said they
would be willing to pay more for a sustainable product, according to the
report.

As the ed tech coordinator and mobile integration specialist of Eanes
Independent School District in Austin, Texas, cybersecurity is very much
top of mind for Brianna Hodges. While topics including cyber safety and
student privacy have always played roles in the district, the technology
students now use regularly in the 1:1 district has changed.

Thats why Hodges believe its crucial students are taught to think more
about how theyre engaging with technology in their lives. And she knows
that requires more than just giving children a quick lesson once a year.

By OWEN HUGHES Business Correspondent owen.hughes@dailypost.co.uk NEW
research from Barclays Corporate Banking shows that only 4% of
*Generation Z* (16 to 23-year-olds) in Wales are considering a career in
manufacturing. Of these 48% state this is because the career path does
not appeal to them, or they do not believe they have the skills required
(42%) for the role.

Instead, young people in Wales aspire towards careers in education, the
media and hospitality and leisure.

The communes of Santiago, Providencia and Independencia are the most
attractive for millennials to live, according to a report by AGS Visión
Inmobiliaria. Closeness to work places, mobility, greater supply of
equipment and environment, are the reasons for this trend.

The investigation made a cross between the information of the 2017
Census, statistics of real estate offer in the Greater Santiago
-considering values of lease and typology, among others- and an analysis
of connectivity (time and distance) to different poles of equipment,
services and offices .

Digital marketing is an ever-changing landscape, thanks to the strides
in digital technology. The prevalence of smartphones and tablets, along
with internet penetration, have added more power to digital marketing.
Going digital means using the entire gamut of technologies - from the
use of artificial intelligence to wearables. It's no longer just about
having a website or email marketing.

As a brand, making an impact on every customer (internal or external),
and opening up multiple channels of communication for customers is no
more a luxury, but a necessity.

Through apps and online platforms like Drizly, Minibar and even Amazon
Fresh, consumers have a stunning variety of alcohol on-demand options.
For the adult beverage brands, however, it's not as easy. Complex legal
considerations vary by state and retailer, and with such a variety of
ecommerce models, is it really worth it for adult beverage brands to
push for a slice of the online/ecommerce market?

Definitely. Why? Because while today's online alcohol sales figures may
be a bit dry (only 8% of total adult beverage sales come from ecommerce,
according to Profitero), the oldest of *Gen Z* — consumers who have
grown up hardwired to shop online — will soon be turning 21.

The decrease in agency profits and the infusion of record funds for
advertising on the YouTube video platform is noted by the gurus of the
advertising market in Kazakhstan. At the same time, experts named
expenses for the services of bloggers and influencers as one of the most
popular lines in the budget. The CEO of Select Communication Group,
Viktor Eliseev, told about the main trends in the advertising market.

Recently, the advertising market in Kazakhstan has grown a bit.
According to the monitoring of the advertising activity of the TNS
agency and the expert evaluation of sales houses, 2017 ended at 41
billion tenge, which is a 13% increase compared to the previous period.
More than 46 billion tenge was predicted in 2018. Now the market is
closing, and the picture will clear up in early 2019.

After initially launching in early 2017, Heineken’s first non-alcoholic
beer has expanded to more than 30 global markets and is now officially
coming to the US. Though not as popular a trend as it is in Europe, the
low-ABV and no-alcohol US beer and wine categories are growing.

Heineken 0.0 is an alcohol-free malt beverage brewed using only natural
ingredients, with 69 calories per bottle. Blue labeling on the bottle -
a color often associated with non-alcoholic varieties - is used create a
point of differentiation from Heineken's classic green branding.

MUMBAI: Popular dating app Tinder has done a unique study on the youth
population in India revealing that the early 20s have acquired "a new
meaning and cultural significance" for the GenZ. The study reveals that
the youngsters in the age bracket of 18 to 25 are changing the norms of
"adulting" by trying to be freer in exploring career fits,
relationships, interactions, self expression, self-identity, and the
direction they want their life to take. For both men and women, getting
married and having kids ranks fairly low on their 5 year-goals lists and
aspirations. So does accumulating assets - they would much rather
collect experiences.

Of course we want to keep children safe. But exposure to normal stresses
and strains is vital for their future wellbeing

We talk incessantly about how to make children more “resilient”, but
whatever we’re doing, it’s not working. Rates of anxiety disorders and
depression are
rising[https://sites.psu.edu/ccmh/files/2018/02/2017_CCMH_Report-1r4m88x.pdf]
rapidly among teenagers, and in the US universities can’t hire

enough[http://time.com/5190291/anxiety-depression-college-university-students/]
to keep up with the demand. What are we doing wrong?

As stores try desperately to entice customers with bargain-busting
January Sales, Tanya Sweeney talks to the young trailblazers building
their own clothes empires on a fast-growing fashion app 'The younger
generation are interested in building a side hustle'

When 22-year-old Donabate native Grainne Binns downloaded the fashion
app Depop four years ago, relatively few Irish buyers and sellers were
using it. Yet for the fashion graduate, who now works in design and
styling, it provided a handy alternative to overpriced vintage shops in
Dublin's city centre. And there were serious bargains to be had: "I
remember buying a pair of vintage, barely-worn Reebok shoes for about
€30, after seeing them for €100 in town."

A growing number of people are embracing alternative and adventurous
foods after trying it for the first time during their travels, and as
public awareness of animal welfare and sustainability concerns grow.

During a recent trip to Fuzhou city in south-eastern China, travel
bloggers Chris Behrsin and Ola Jagielska thought they were ordering a
chicken dish, only to later discover that it was actually frog leg stew.

Hyderabadi tweens and teens were in for a gala time tapping into their
creative interests at the TeenFest Hyderabad, held last weekend. The air
was bustling with energy and enthusiasm as millennials showcased their
talents on stage. From live music and dance performances to daredevil
sports challenges, this carnival brought the best out of the *Gen-Z*.An
art event, curated by the Children’s Fine Art Gallery, encouraged
participants to appreciate modern art from a different tangent.
“Youngsters have a different perspective towards contemporary art. We
are trying to help those ideas flourish through these activities,” said
Atiya Amjad, one of the curators of the art show.

The incentive from Australian Wool Innovation stems from a drop in the

Special to the Star Tribune Jillian Brooks knows what a helicopter
parent is. “They’re parents who watch everything,” she said. Brooks, a
chemistry major at the University of Minnesota, wasn’t raised by
helicopter parents, but many of her peers were. “I have friends whose
parents micromanage them,” she said. “They think they’re helping, but
they make it difficult for their kids to figure things out on their
own.” The term was first used in a 1969 manual about managing teenagers
to describe a negative mode of overprotective parenting. In the past 15
years or so, the term became a part of the popular lexicon as an
increasing number of moms and dads hovered around their children,
managing their offspring’s home, school and social environments. But
today, those who observe the subtle shifts in parenting styles say that
the term is giving way to another aerial symbol.

As chief executive officer of Benefit Cosmetics, Jean-André Rougeot
helped propel the brand from a hero-product-based business to a
full-fledged line with over $1.5 billion in sales. Now the newly
appointed ceo of Sephora Americas will need to tap into those
considerable brand-building skills — not to mention his knowledge of the
competitive retail landscape — to steer Sephora through a critical
moment in its development.

That was the consensus of beauty insiders after learning of Rougeot’s
appointment on Tuesday. Though the executive himself is largely unknown
to many of the brands that he will work with in his new role, his skills
as a brand builder are widely recognized.
