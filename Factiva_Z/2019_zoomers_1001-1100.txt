French beauty brand L’Occitane Group is moving towards fully sustainable
packaging.

The group, owners of brands like L’Occitane en Provence and Melvita, is
aiming to use only sustainable plastic in its packaging. (Currently,
only 30 percent of L’Occitane’s products are made with recycled plastic
and its exclusive to darker-colored items, like its namesake brand’s
Immortelle Precious.) Through its new efforts with sustainable plastic
provider Loop Industries, the brand expects to be fully sustainable by
2025. L’Occitane Group would not reveal the investment in this partnership.

I am pleased to report that the American dream is alive and well for an
overwhelming majority of Americans.

This claim might sound far-fetched given the cultural climate in the
United States today. Especially since President Trump took office,
hardly a day goes by without a fresh tale of economic anxiety, political
disunity or social struggle. Opportunities to achieve material success
and social mobility through hard, honest work — which many people,
including me, have assumed to be the core idea of the American dream —
appear to be diminishing.

LOS ANGELES, Feb. 5 -- JNSQ issued the following news release:

Introducing the first rose brand created for millennial women that
doesn't talk over them, or down to them. JNSQ Rose Cru is an
easy-to-enjoy luxury wine created in the classic French style and
crafted from premium California grapes, giving it both a timeless
elegance and a modern attitude. This unprecedented approach to
winemaking - and the name gracing the beautifully curvaceous bottle -
were inspired by today's young women setting the world on fire on their
own terms, with a certain je ne sais quoi that's hard to describe but
undeniably irresistible.

Our team at Gillette sparked an important worldwide conversation with
the new "We Believe" ad[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koPmuEyP3a0].
The film shows men being role models by stepping in to stop bullying and
harassment and demonstrating how to treat people with respect. It has
gotten nearly 100 million views on social media. We're proud of the ad's
message about what it means to be a good man today, and how men can step
up to reject bad behavior and take positive action.

Not everyone agrees with the message and there have been some vocal
detractors. Some said the ad attacks masculinity, while others said it
sounded like a lecture.

CARMEL VALLEY, Calif., Feb. 5, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Today's organic
shoppers are more mainstream and diverse than most contemporary
stereotypes of pro-organic shoppers, according to a recent survey
conducted by organic produce leader Earthbound Farm. The "Annual Organic
& Other Lifestyle Choices" survey yields fresh insights that compare a
spate of lifestyle habits including music and hobby choices, pet
ownership, meal priorities and other factors not previously studied
among shoppers choosing organic. While some results were not surprising
-- health is still the number one reason to purchase organic and the
younger the consumer the more organic they say they buy --others were
contrary to common assumptions of organic shoppers. Of the 500+
consumers surveyed, a whopping 40 percent say they plan to increase
their household's organic consumption in 2019.

Characterized as disloyal to brands and highly individualistic, *Gen Z*
is finally coming of age. This means more purchasing power is putting
them on the radar of brands vying to lock them in as customers.

Members of *Gen Z*, said to be born roughly between 1996 and 2011, grew
up glaring at screens, consuming content at faster rates than previous
generations.

For several years, it was nearly impossible to open a trade journal,
read a newspaper or watch the news without hearing about the millennial
generation. It’s true that they make up most of today’s workforce and HR
teams need to customize their offerings to appeal to them. But now,
there’s a new set of fresh faces entering the workplace: *Generation Z*
— those in the 18- to 24-year-old range. In less than a decade, these
young people will make up about 20% of the U.S. workforce.

IN Australia there are now more people born since 1980 than before 1980.
This means that Generation Y (born from 1980 to 1994), *Generation Z*
(born from 1995 to 2009) and Generation Alpha (born since 2010) comprise
more than half of the population.

The year 2019 is also a milestone year because Generations Y and Z now
comprise the majority of the workforce – outnumbering Generations X and
the Baby Boomers for the first time.

BEIJING — If China’s e-commerce players were high school archetypes,
Xiaohongshu, also known as Red, would be the cool, hipster girl.

Tmall and JD.com may be the the most popular and dominant — online
shopping’s prom king and queen — but for the Millennial and *Gen Z*
female, it’s hard to wrest the crown from Xiaohongshu.

From the freedom to fail to more gender-balanced offices, inventive *Gen
Z* girls hope to transform the tech industry

Trisha Prabhu, an 18-year-old entrepreneur and computing student at
Harvard University, shot to recognition at a young age. A research
project she started when she was 13 for science class led to the
development of ReThink[http://www.rethinkwords.com/whatisrethink], an
app designed to stop cyberbullying by detecting offensive messages and
encouraging users to reconsider their (potentially angry and
emotionally-charged) posts before pressing send. She then embarked on
what she describes as the “world’s biggest juggling act” by developing
the app at the same time as completing high school.

OUR shopping habits have long provided entertainment for those looking
to forge connections between economic or political landscapes and the
stuff we buy. The Lipstick Index, coined by Estée Lauder chair Leonard
Lauder during the grips of the credit crunch, was a fine example of such
behaviour, with the chairman concluding that women tend to buy more
lipsticks during times of economic uncertainty.

A decreased demand for bras that generated in-your-face cleavage,
confirmed by a dip in profits and market share of US lingerie giant
Victoria's Secret last year, also led to the anthropological conclusion
that in the muddied times of #metoo, women were buying underwear that
allowed them to be the most natural version of themselves.

If you’re part of *Generation Z* and want to buy a house before you turn
30, be glad you live in Cincinnati.

Eighteen-year-olds in Cincinnati need to save $193 every month for the
next 12 years to buy, with a 10 percent down payment plus closing costs,
a median-priced home. That ranks the Queen City 22nd-lowest of 100
cities surveyed by Santa Clara, Calif.-based website Realtor.com. Those
same 18-year-olds would need to save $122 every month with 5 percent
down and $335 a month with 20 percent down.

In times when everything changes rapidly and the future is increasingly
difficult to predict beyond speculation, among the accelerated evolution
facing e-commerce it is still possible to identify some general trends,
which are worth pointing to to be successful in the future. Online
sales: Experience, experience The user experience (UX) is so important,
that Google bases in this much of its search algorithms, benefiting
those pages that are fast, consistent and easy to use. In this age,
experience is everything. Therefore, it is necessary to offer a relevant
UX, for example, by personalizing the interactions with each client
through all the channels. 80% of participants in an Epsilon study said
that personalized experiences increase their interest in buying a
particular brand. An interesting example is provided by BILD Shop, a
German sporting goods retailer that uses personalization to, for
example, detect the fanatical users of Bayern Munich and offer them
articles from their team.

MINNEAPOLIS, MN, Feb. 5, 2019 /PRNewswire/ - As the population ages, the
responsibility of caring for aging relatives is falling largely to next
of kin. In fact, one in five (19%) American adults currently assists an
older family member, according to a new Ipsos survey conducted on behalf
of RBC Wealth Management- U.S. Specifically, 17 percent of respondents
regularly help with chores, cooking, cleaning or traveling to
appointments, 5 percent provide housing and 5 percent offer financial
support.*

RBC collaborated with Ipsos to poll more than 2,000 Americans aged 35
and above on a range of issues related to their personal finances. The
survey found that among those who provide financial support to an older
relative, the average monthly contribution is $403. Twenty-two percent
contribute $500-999 and 14 percent contribute more than $1,000.

A new study has found that six obesity-related cancers are on the rise
in young adults, another sign of the worldwide epidemic of excess weight.

The individual risk of cancer remains small in young adults, and
unrecognized factors may also be at play. Still, the study found that
for millennials and *Generation Z* — people in their 30s and even their
20s — incidence rates are rising for endometrial, gallbladder, kidney,
multiple myeloma, pancreatic, and colorectal cancers, all of which have
been linked to obesity.

According to the 2019 State of the Conference Industry Report just released by Omnipress, knowledge and education continued to be a significant driver of value for associations. But with member demographics more diverse than ever, organizations are facing increased challenges in how they deliver this content to members. At the same time, associations are presented with substantial opportunities to increase visibility, extend their value and reach new audiences using their greatest asset--educational content. 
 

MADISON, Wis., Feb. 5, 2019 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- For the fifth
consecutive year, Omnipress, provider of print and digital content
solutions for associations and other organizations, conducted an online
survey of 150 association and conference professionals to track the
evolution of educational content and the role it plays at the annual
conference. The results have been compiled and published in the 2019
State of the Conference Industry Report.

'Farmers are used to dealing with fluctuations in the weather but if we

growers out of business'

Britain’s chips are under threat as climate change triggers
unpredictable weather and brings sweeping changes to the nation’s fruit
and vegetable growers.

It was always going to take a bright, bold and ultra-cool shade to
dethrone millennial pink — the colour favoured by the social media set
for years.

Enter *gen-Z* yellow — a hue that covers anything from canary yellow to
mustard. It is a lot louder than millennial pink and its younger-
generational name instantly piques the interest of Instagrammers keen to
jump on the next big trend.

them the freedom to express themselves through the transformative power
of styling. Also, offering smart, practical clothing for today's
non-conformist fashionistas, who are ready to embrace avant-garde with
great gusto, and who refuse to be stereotyped. From Eka's organic
narrative to Nikhil Thampi's body-con tailoring - designers conjured
visions of a powerful woman, who has a mind of her own and refuses to be

In their rush to capture the attention of the next generation, brands
must not forget cashed-up Baby Boomers who are becoming more technology
literate, according to a new study.

While brands do much to target the elusive *Gen Z* and Millennials,
Boomers, with their bigger wallets and still significant numbers - the
cohort will lead to a doubling in the number of people aged over 60 to 2
billion by 2050, according to the Milken Institute - are emerging growth
opportunities for brands, a new report by big-four consulting firm EY said.

Despite the growing influence of online and digital shopping, over 70%
of consumers prefer to shop for consumer packaged goods from retailers
with a physical presence--whether shopping in-store or online--as
opposed to 29% who shop primarily online, according to results from a
recent survey by DXC Technology published in an IDC InfoBrief: "Winning
Over Shoppers in the Digital Age: A Guide for Retailers and CPG Companies. "

Going against conventional wisdom, the survey revealed that showrooming
strengthens brick-and-mortar stores, with 36% of consumers buying
in-store after exploring products online. Of those surveyed, 94% say a
store associate's help is important in feeling confident they are buying
the right product. The survey also found that same-day or next-day
delivery or in-store pickup options are not key differentiators--unless
enterprises are trying to reach specific groups or segments of customers.

Roughly four in 10 U.S. drivers are unable to recognize the tire
pressure monitoring system (TPMS) warning symbol on their car's
dashboard, according to a study commissioned by Goodyear Auto Service
and its affiliated Just Tires retail network.

The lack of awareness of the TPMS symbol — an electronic system designed
to monitor the air pressure of a vehicle's tires — is a clear sign that
many drivers are in the dark on what the light means and what to do when
it's triggered, Goodyear said.

It's pretty well established that colleges and universities are having a
trying time when it comes to enrollment. ¶ So colleges have had to get
creative. They've widened their target recruitment areas, frozen or
lowered tuition and added new majors in in-demand fields. ¶ And then
there are other approaches that take it to the next level. Read on for a
look at some of the ways local colleges and universities are trying to
stand out from the crowd in a competitive environment. This information
was all collected via email. — Rachel Abbey McCafferty

programming; nearly 3 billion minutes of Brat content were consumed
across YouTube, Facebook and Instagram in 2018, Brat says. It has 2.7
million subscribers to its YouTube channel.

In his nearly 30 years in the restaurant business, having done every job
from waiter to regional director, Michael Ryan has learned a good deal
about running a profitable house. His operational savvy helped make a
success of legendary New York City names like Shaw’s Crab House and Blue
Water Grill. Meanwhile, his watchful eye took note of many liabilities:
the time it took to count the register drawers at night, for example, or
the fivers and ten spots that would sometimes disappear into employees’
pockets as they worked behind the bar.

Which is why both locations of his latest concept, Filipino taqueria
Flip Sigi, do not accept cash.

Starting a new school year should be an exciting time, but — as my great
niece Isla would say — for some it can also be ‘a bit scary’.

It is only natural that many kids — and their parents — feel nervous in
the build-up to the first week back.

In a world of heightened competition with emerging threats and general
business environmental changes, the “war” for talent takes on a special
urgency. Millennials make up almost half of the US workforce and *Gen Z*
is starting to graduate from college, meaning that understanding the
younger members of the talent pool is crucial.

The processes and structures which may have been effective in building
organizational capacity in the past likely won’t be able to sufficiently
address current market changes. Acquiring, developing, and retaining new
talent in today’s rapidly changing landscape requires insurers to
rethink existing approaches, including:

According to a report by ProPakistani, companies like Samsung, Huawei
and Nokia might soon start manufacturing phones in Pakistan. These
companies want to leverage the cheap labor cost in Pakistan and, with a
new smartphone manufacturing policy that the government is working on,
they might soon start setting up their local manufacturing plants.

According to a local newspaper, these manufacturers have shown interest
in setting up local plants in Pakistan and this interest was reported
during a meeting held on 30th January to representatives of Federal
Board of Revenue (FBR), Ministry of Information Technology and Telecom,
Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) and Engineering Development
Board (EDB).

Most Britons are so concerned about online snooping that they refuse to
have a digital assistant such as Alexa in their home, a survey has found.

Fifty-three per cent have no plans to buy an Amazon Echo, which answers
to the name of Alexa, or similar devices, according to the study by
Edelman, the communications company.

Already the most significant long-term trend affecting drinks companies,
climate change will top the 2019 agenda with an acceleration in
greenhouse gas(GHG) emission reductions urgently needed. Agricultural
supply chains will be a prime focus as companies come under pressure to
reduce their indirect 'Scope 3' emissions. Ben Cooper investigates.

A report from the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) in October, warning just how off the pace global efforts
to address climate change are, briefly brought the world to rapt - and
justly-alarmed - attention.As the narrower fixations of the age
reclaimed their contrastingly-undeserved monopolisation of the news
agenda, there could be a feeling that it was just another exposition of
the risks of climate change. All it has to say to the global community,
and to its drinks manufacturers, is that an issue that was already
incontestably the gravest threat humankind isfacing, remains so.

On Sunday, millions of Americans will hunker down in front of the
nearest big screen to watch the Super Bowl and its roster of splashy,
celebrity-studded advertisements. For brands, it's a crucial stage: In
our extremely fragmented media landscape, there's no better way to reach
a crowd.

CBS is reportedly charging $5.1 million to $5.3 million for 30 seconds
of commercial time during the game, and to make that kind of investment
worth it, brands pour resources into formulating bits of theater that
might get viewers talking (recall Budweiser's eye-rollingly annoying
''Whassup'' guys and tear jerky Clydesdales). The absurd premises
advanced by this year's roster of Super Bowl ads are set to include
Jason Bateman operating an elevator (brought to you by Hyundai),
Christina Applegate tooling around town with a back-talking batch of
candy (M&Ms), and Chance the Rapper dancing in an airplane hangar with
the Backstreet Boys (Doritos).

A recent study of Australian teens' attitudes to religion made headlines
for its negative findings: that 52 per cent of Australian teens do not
identify with any religion and only 37 per cent believe in God.

The Australian *Generation Z* study by academics from the ANU, Deakin
and Monash, released late last year, found 38 per cent identify as
Christian, with Muslims (3 per cent), Buddhist (2 per cent), Hindu (1
per cent) and other religions (2 per cent ) totalling 46 per cent. Two
per cent weren't sure.

Tourists walk under lanterns on a street in a Qingzhou ancient town in
Weifang, East China's Shandong Province on Saturday. Lanterns were
decorated in the ancient town for the upcoming Chinese Lunar New Year.

"With or without money, go home for Spring Festival" seems to be the
prevailing sentiment that drives millions of Chinese to head home ahead
of the most important holiday for family reunions.

As a young adult living in the generation of technology, I've always
been expected to know clever ways to express myself. Assumptions are as
high as Mt. Everest because they think, how is it possible for me to not
know how to reconfigure our internet connection when I could simply
Google and have answers right at my fingertips? I roll my eyes real hard
whenever I get remarks about how lucky I am to have been born in an age
where I don't need to improvise and dictate my news report through a
payphone at the corner of Ermita.

Meet China's *Generation Z*. Spoiled by parents and grandparents for
being the only child in their families, these youngsters are living it
up compared to their cautious, conservative peers in the West, according
to a new survey.

[*Generation Z*]

The Pew Research Center, a nonprofit group that specializes in measuring
public opinion across demographic groups, recently announced that it had
settled on what to call the "post-millennial" generation born from about
1997 to 2012. Taking its cue from popular usage, Pew will apply the
label "*Generation Z*," or "*Gen Z*" for short.

Sex Education, the glossy British show about sixth-formers and their
messy relationships, has gripped teenagers and their parents. The cast
and creators talk to Ed Potton

They range from a boy who does creative things with a warm melon and a
girl who vomits on her boyfriend's penis, to a teenager with rampant
pubic hair ("I'm like a wolverine") and a virgin who writes a sci-fi
comic whose heroine goes "on a quest for an alien dick to deflower her".
All of adolescent carnality is there in Sex Education, the
super-stylised Netflix comedy that has seized the imagination like no
British school series since Skins and which the streaming service claims
has been watched by 40 million households around the world.

YOUNG people entering the hospitality industry may not have the
preferred communication style that many of their employers may assume.

CQ University masters researcher Jacobus Vorster says Millennials and
*Generation Z* employees often have traditional values and may prefer
face-to-face interactions, rather than using phone apps and other
technological innovations that their generations typically are known for.

The iPhone is omnipresent and many of us will have bought ours from an
Apple store. But the tech giant is now spending hundreds of millions of
dollars, perhaps much more, revamping its stores in an apparent effort
to persuade us not to buy a thing.

In the future, when going into an Australian Apple store, you might see
as many people taking part in workshops, asking for advice or even just
catching up on emails as buying actual products.

Instagram is a marketing force to be reckoned with. With brands now
having the ability to generate revenue via advertising and shopping
posts and a growing base of users, it is currently the it platform for
reaching the coveted *Gen Z* and millennial demographics. However, as
what happened with Facebook, when everyone's mom, dad, and grandparent
join the platform, teens and young adults might once again migrate to
the next hip (and probably frustratingly obfuscatory) channel. Despite
this, the #hashtags, location pins, [c]mentioning, and a combination of
permanence and ephemerality all create a desirable package that keeps
users coming back for more and brands close on their heels trying to
grab and keep their attention. Somewhere in the middle of that mix are
libraries. Not seeking to make a profit, libraries are in the unique
position to use social media for the social good, freely spreading
knowledge to those in their communities.

Nearly 80 percent of *Generation Z* wants to buy a home before they turn
30, but they'll have to save a bundle over the next decade to realize
their dream, a realtor.com study released Thursday found.

The generation following millennials, whose oldest member is about 23,
on average nationally will have to save $304 each month for the next 12
years to put down even 10 percent and pay closing costs on a median
priced home.

Delivering financial experiences to the on-demand generation

A Google search asking, "How will *Gen Z* change your bank?" yields more
than 84.4 million links. The plethora of information regarding the
traits, habits and preferences of people born between 1996 and the
mid-2000s is nothing short of cumbersome.

The Millennial generation has been discussed ad nauseum in articles,
books, conferences and even simply daily conversations. It's the up and
coming generation that is making waves in marketing, consumer goods, and
hiring/recruitment. Except they are not "up and coming" any more. This
generation is now fully in the adult, working world. It's a huge
generation in terms of numbers, so the attention being paid to this
group is not unfounded. In fact, this is a prime group in need of
industry training (see Rich Jefferson's column, "Innovative Training for
Industry Innovation," on page 46).

But I was surprised at a graphic I came across recently that showed the
current age ranges of the Silent Generation through *Generation Z*
(roughly, those born between 1996 and 2010). The oldest individuals in
*Generation Z* are already 23 years old. You likely have a few working
in your foundry now.

Snapchat started in 2011 as a place where users could communicate
through photo, video, and text messaging that would disappear once
viewed. It was very much a closed network platform with an interface
that seemed to be intentionally complicated and geared toward the online
habits of teens (Bloomberg dedicated an entire article to this concept
entitled "How Snapchat Built a Business by Confusing Olds" (1)). It
increased its reach and application in the brand and marketing world
with the introduction of Snapchat Stories, collections of chronological
snaps that expire within twenty-four hours (just like Instagram
Stories). Unlike Instagram (IG), Snapchat's focus is still more closed
network with the deliberate absence of public-facing follower numbers
and usernames, engagement metrics (i.e., likes, comments, views, etc.),
and permanent posts (unlike IG feed posts).

In an effort to reach as many patrons as possible, many librarians over
the years have worked hard to leverage their social media accounts, both
as promotional tools and as communication resources. As many library
users (especially teens, young adults, and first and second-year college
students) are migrating to more interactive and private networks, an
interest in reaching these demographics has been increasing in the
library community. At the forefront of these conversations are photo-
and video-sharing heavy hitters Snapchat and Instagram. Some
professionals are at the beginning stages of deciding whether to add
these platforms to their social media repertoires, while others are
seeking ways to effectively incorporate digital book talks,
#BookFaceFriday hashtags, and custom library geofilters.

Accountants play a major role as commerce adopts new technologies

Accounting firms are seeing demand for their business driven by broad
technological change in the ways their clients operate and public policy
changes that necessitate revising business strategy. In a strong
economy, tech is taking over how financial services are provided to make
it faster and more accessible, and how business data is gathered and
analyzed.

Banks, retailers and technology companies have spent years relentlessly
working to replace cash with plastic, digital or mobile alternatives.
And cash has hit back hard.

In China, which has the most residents paying via mobile wallets, the
government has cracked down on merchants that won't accept cash. In the
U.S., the New York City Council is conducting hearings on a bill that
would ban restaurants and retailers from not accepting cash.

For Days, the circular membership T-shirt brand launched in September of
2018, gives its customers an unlimited rotation of shirts: They’re sent
back to the company, recycled and replenished. Now, the company is
licensing its circular business model to other fashion brands.

This week, For Days, which raised nearly $3 million in funding at the
end of 2018 from Allbirds investor Rosecliff Ventures, began working
with 2-year-old DTC bra brand Harper Wilde to implement a circular model
for the brand’s bras. Since Jan. 17, Harper Wilde customers have been
able to pack up old bras and send them to the brand to be recycled,
rather than toss them in the garbage to languish for years.

American Eagle Outfitters Inc. wants its customers to be confident and
like themselves, whether it’s for body positivity or for self-expression.

For the last few years, whether it’s the women’s intimates brand Aerie
or the core American Eagle brand, the company has made a bigger push in
the inclusivity realm, telling its customers that it’s okay for them to
be who they are, express their personality and feel good about themselves.

Robots, space cowboys and the late Princess Diana were among the diverse
inspirations behind Bluezone’s Spring/Summer 2020 trend presentation.

Curated by the France-based denim consultancy, Monsieur T, the six-part
trend forecast played to the denim industry’s strengths, while
highlighting some of its weaknesses. “We’re selling a lifestyle,” said
Monsieur T founder Tilmann Wröbel, “but are we sure this is the
lifestyle that motivates a younger generation to buy denim?”

For many teenagers in New Mexico, getting a driver's license means going
through some unavoidable steps. First: Turn 15. Next: Get your hands on
a couple of hundred bucks.

Driver's education is an important and required step in getting your
license as a minor in New Mexico, and it doesn't always come cheap.

Millennials, and *Generation Z* behind them, are changing the way they
access healthcare. In fact, 45% of 18- to 29-year-olds say they don't
have a primary care physician. Instead, they're opting for on-demand
healthcare.

Traditionally, individuals and families see primary care physicians
several times a year and build relationships with their doctors over
time. Visiting the same primary care physician when an illness strikes,
or for an annual wellness checkup, can help the doctor notice changes in
a patient's health and catch issues before they become more serious (and
costly).

Last night, Klarna, the Swedish bank, which prides itself on being
non-bank-like, kicked off its first Stateside “Smoooth Session” with a
welcome message from chief executive officer Sebastian Siemiatkowski
that included an effortlessly suave video of fur-clad Snoop Dogg —
complete with “silky smooth” Afghan hounds.

The event was held at Manhattan’s Michelson Studio in the West Village
and was ticketed as an “immersive experience designed to feed your
senses and push you out of your fashion comfort zone.” More than 200
retailers, brands and influencers attended.

Messes of our own making

Five weeks of government shutdown, another school strike in our fair
city and now our county (Meriwether Lewis must be relieved he was not
the namesake) makes national headlines for hosting an outbreak of a
disease that was officially declared eliminated in the early 2000s. It's
called adulting, and everyone from our national leaders to our local
civic leaders to our fellow neighbors needs to get their you-know-what
together ASAP.

Most of the successful firms I have worked with over the years have a
disciplined process in place to manage employees. This can range from
setting initial job expectations to developing compensation plans and
guiding overall career progression.

During volatile market conditions, these processes are especially
important because they help reinforce that employees can trust that
their jobs are secure. Trust is the operative word here because in
volatile times employees need to feel that they're being paid fairly
and, moreover, that they can trust the firm and its decisions.
