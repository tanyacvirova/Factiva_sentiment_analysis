When cleancult Co-Founder Ryan Lupberger looked at other brands of
cleaning products, he noted that the same problems always appeared to
arise even with better-for-the-world offerings. They used really heavy
plastic packaging, Lupberger told PYMNTS in an interview, adding he also
didnt understand their ingredient lists. At the same time, he said, no
brand has come at this from an online perspective through new branding
and distribution online. Today, his company sells green eco-friendly
cleaning products on its direct-to-consumer (D2C) website through
starter kits and recurring refills.

Mumbai, March 20 -- With general elections in India just around the
corner, the debate on employment growth is reaching fever pitch. In the
absence of regular and credible employment statistics, perceptions about
job creation will be critical for the election outcome. Among the urban
youth at least, these perceptions may be changing but the majority
remain concerned about jobs.

According to survey data collected by market researcher YouGov in
collaboration with Mint, more urban youth believe it is easier to find a
job now compared to six months ago. About 43% of the *Gen-Z* (19- to
22-year-olds) and 45% of younger millennials (23- to 29-year-olds) think
it is "somewhat" to "extremely" easy to find a job nowadays.

India, March 20 -- The learning and development process of the *Gen Z*
is undergoing massive changes with the advent of technology. The
education system, by fueling the evolution of teaching methods and tools
used in the classroom has been driven by the demands of the digital
natives, whose lives revolve around digital screens and connected
devices. Devices like PCs, laptops and printers have become the
functional extension of this generation, at school as well as home.

I want to begin this article about the freelance revolution with a
favorite Albert Einstein quote. Einstein chides us to remember that we
are the authors of our opportunity: The world as we have created it is a
process of our thinking. We cannot change it without changing our thinking.

Its a favorite quote, and reminds me of the great learning experiences
Ive had interviewing the entrepreneurs and tech pioneers whose
innovative spirit has made possible the freelance revolution. One of
those pioneers is Paul Estes.

It's time we forget that Ontario's government "for the people" has, so
far this year, announced their plan to remove primary school class
sizes, their plan to integrate kids who need intensive one-on-one
therapy into regular classrooms and, of course, their horrendous
post-secondary initiative to destabilize the lower income class as they
planned to attend higher learning institutions.

Forget the crumbling infrastructure that dozens of schools face.

New Delhi, March 20 -- Millennials in rural India could influence $220
billion worth of annual spending, with over $177 billion of this in
discretionary expenditure, as migration to urban areas and the internet
fuel their aspirations, according to researcher Kantar IMRB and Dialogue
Factory.

India is home to the world's largest population of millennials-typically
defined as those aged 18-35. At 450 million, these millennials are
influencing the way Indians eat, shop, commute and buy, much like their
global counterparts.

In the past decade, billboards and outdoor advertising have gone through
a renaissance of sorts. While ad spending on other traditional media
continues to decline, out-of-home (OOH) spend continues to see
incremental growth.

Mexico City, Mar 19 (EFE).- Mexico has the potential to become a world
pioneer in technological innovation, thanks to its demographic growth,
infrastructure development and the surge in financial technology,
according to a report released this Tuesday.

The study by US-based consultants Frost & Sullivan dubbed "The Future of
Mexico - A Global Hub for Innovation," maintains that "demographic
advantages peaking in the next decade and improved start-up support will
lay the foundation for a robust culture of innovation."

The ingredients to innovate in Mexico are different from those of other
countries in the world. Research and development (R & D) is the basis of
this innovation, for which we must invest at least 2.5% of the Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) if we want to place the country among the most
innovative in the world, according to Richard Sear , partner and senior
vice president of Visionary Innovation for the Frost & Sullivan market
consultancy .

According to the study The future of Mexico: an innovation hub,
developed by the consultancy under the auspices of the National Chamber
of the Electronic Industry, Telecommunications and Information
Technologies (Canieti) and the Cisco technology, Mexico climbed around 3
points in the Innovation Index between 2012 and 2018; but the little
investment in research and development (R & D) that is less than 0.5% of
GDP, has left it lagging along with countries such as Chile, Uruguay,
Nigeria, Argentina and Costa Rica.

Miniature, pint-sized bags have been on our radar for a few seasons now,
and while they're a definite relief for our backs and shoulders, they're
not always the most practical, especially when you have things to carry
and places to go. We're not so surprised that the pendulum is starting
to swing the other way, then, as we all need a bag that fits more than a
pencil and one key. From colourful totes to chic carryalls, Rebecca Tay
presents five XL bags that should fit everything but the kitchen sink.

PATCH THINGS UP If your requirements for a bag include something that
stands out but can also go from work to weekend - and complement the
rest of your wardrobe - consider this patchwork chevron print duffel.
It's smart and chic, and its classic monochrome hue means it looks good
with jeans, a black suit and nearly everything in between. Coach,

With the agriculture industry entering the seventh year of the economic
reset, some producers are examining niche or value-added markets.
Organic production, hemp, point of origin, and specialty crops are just
a few niche markets that come to mind.

Given the changes in consumer preferences, the growth of these markets
is inevitable. The millennials, *Generation Z* and Generation A will
shape the markets. The key to these domestic and global markets will be
transparency concerning point of origin. The personalization and
customization from producers to the consumer will be attributes that
provide initial entrance into the marketplace.

MEXICO CITY, Mexico – – Through greater investment in R&D and education,
and by encouraging a tech-enabled society, Mexico’s economy has the
potential to gain more than $245 billion in cumulative gross domestic
product (GDP) growth through 2025. Demographic advantages peaking in the
next decade and improved start-up support will lay the foundation for a
robust culture of innovation. Even though R&D spending has been higher
in countries like the US, Korea, the UK, and Singapore, in the last six
years, growth of new start-ups led by 18- to 64-year-olds has been
highest in Mexico. Indeed, since 2010, the number of Mexico’s tech
start-ups has tripled.

With the total secondhand market projected to reach $51 billion in five
years from today’s $24 billion, resale is a high-speed train that more
consumers are riding. Don’t even try to stop it. That’s the conclusion
of ThredUp’s annual Resale Report with research and data from
third-party retail analytics firm GlobalData.

“More people are shopping secondhand than ever before,” said James
Reinhart, cofounder and chief executive officer of ThredUp. “It’s this
onward march. We don’t anticipate the resale industry getting smaller
over time. [The question] is, who will be the winners and losers over
time and how will consumer preferences change. One of the starkest
things to come out of this report is the data point that 72 percent of
secondhand shoppers said they’re shifting spending away from traditional
retail.”

Harris Poll Underscores Inequity in Credit Scoring System for Minorities
and Younger Generations

LOS ANGELES, March 19, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- New research from the Harris
Poll and ZestFinance shows deep dissatisfaction among most Americans
with the traditional credit scoring system. A majority of younger
Americans as well as minority groups believe the way their credit is
assessed stacks the economic odds against them relative to other
demographics. Eight out of ten Hispanics and African Americans say their
credit score is an inaccurate representation of who they are, and want
lenders to look at more factors in lending decisions. A majority would
be happy to give up more personal data if it meant fairer access to loans.

Well-known ag economist David Kohl acknowledges dairy farmers have had
it rough during the past four years, but he says a high business IQ will
be a difference-maker going forward.

“Agriculture is in the seventh year of an economic reset,” according to
Kohl. “Dairy is in the fourth year of an economic reset. Farmers are
living with low profit margins and high volatility.”

While it's true that FMCG brands must consider the needs of Gen Y, they
also need to keep an eye on who will follow - *Gen Z*.

E ach generation comes with a unique set of behaviors and presents a
unique set of opportunities for those looking to reach, engage, and turn
them into loyal consumers. For the last decade or so, Millennials, or
Gen Y, have been the generation for brands to engage with as their
spending power grows ever higher. But now is the time for fast-moving
consumer goods (FMCG) brands to shift their focus to the following
generation - *Generation Z* (12 to 21 years old). Why? In Vietnam, by
2025, *Gen Z* will account for around 25 per cent of the country’s
workforce, which translates into 15 million potential consumers.

India, March 19 -- More than a perfect house or balcony, it is the
number of stamps on passports that milleninals save for today. With
India estimated to become the youngest country by 2022, the Indian
millennials are majorly influencing the country's travel trends, which
show that travel has become a way of life for many young Indians and
they are structuring their work and financial plans to ensure frequent
getaways. They don't share their parents interest of investing in
commodities.

Binar Mentari Malahayati, Beppu, Japan

On a supposedly peaceful Friday afternoon in Christchurch, the city's
very own mosque, al Noor, was attacked by a guy with not only a gun, but
also a recording device. Livestreamed to thousands of people, both
knowing and unknowing, the terrorist on March 15 casually shot everyone
he could find inside the mosque with neither hesitation nor qualms,
using a first-person shooter game-like format.

KEOKUK, Iowa — Diana Martinez, 70, looked at Beto O’Rourke, 46, and made
her choice: It was time for Generation X to fix this country.

“Doesn’t he remind you of Kennedy?” Ms. Martinez said as Mr. O’Rourke
offered firm handshakes and music recommendations to a coffeehouse
crowd. “He’s young. That’s what it’s going to take to try and beat Trump.”

NEW YORK -- Multicultural beauty is no longer just about hair care. The
success of Fenty Beauty, dubbed the Fenty Effect, raised awareness of
the need for broader shade ranges in cosmetics. The next frontier,
experts predict, will be skin care.

There are many reasons why America is changing and what that means for
mass market shelves. Today one or two of every babies born is a baby of
color. Women of color will be the majority in 2060; today 40% of
Americans are considered multicultural.

On Monday, reports surfaced indicating what many MySpace users had long
suspected: that MySpace had deleted a great deal of the content
 uploaded to the platform between 2003 and 2015. Over the weekend, the
social networking platform put up a banner announcing that “as a result
of a server migration project, any photos, videos, and audio files you
uploaded more than three years ago, may no longer be available on or
from MySpace.” When it comes to providing an explanation why, MySpace
has been fairly tight-lipped, though some have hinted that the loss had
less to do with a server migration “glitch” in the system and more to do
with MySpace’s new owner Meredith not wanting to pay to keep the files
up. (The social media site did not respond to a request for comment.)

Streaming entertainment is smacking into the wall of the paradox of
choice — and the cost to consumers of piecing multiple services together.

The boom in subscription streaming services has given consumers more
options than ever, with an array that includes Netflix, Hulu, Amazon
Prime Video, HBO, CBS All Access, Showtime and YouTube Premium. Even
more are coming down the pike with Apple, Disney, WarnerMedia,
NBCUniversal and others promising to enter the fray in a big way.

SHANGHAI — Young consumers are one of the fashion industry’s biggest
sales drivers in China, and at the international, biannual fashion fair
Chic Shanghai, this fact was not easily forgotten.

Chinese Millennials, the post-Eighties and post-Nineties generation,
number about 415 million people, or 31 percent of China’s total
population, according to a study by Goldman Sachs. Although much has
been made of the spending power of this generation, it is the
jiulinghou, or post-Nineties *Generation Z* population, that is making
real waves in the retail sector. These consumers, now coming of age,
have most likely grown up as only children, due to China’s previous
one-child policy, and with relative wealth and economic stability. This
cohort is now fueling demand in the country’s fashion sector. According
to last year’s Bain & Co. Global Luxury Report, the new generations will
deliver 130 percent of market growth, with *Gen Z* showing “original
traits.”

We are thrilled to announce the creation of three new councils that will
help shape three of our ongoing series on Brandweek Inside the Brand:
Women Trailblazers, Innovators and Gen ZEOs. Our purpose at Brandweek is
to share the success stories of leading brand marketers and those who
are paving new paths for marketing overall. To ensure we are on the
right path, we’ve enrolled the top minds for each series who will guide
us along the way. Together, with Adweek editors Lisa Granatstein and
Nadine Dietz, the Councils will determine the top issues for each series
and identify the next wave of rock stars for us to share. Fasten your
seat belts, a wave of inspiration is coming your way!

In 2018, eMarketer
forecast[https://www.emarketer.com/content/connected-tv-advertising] the
number of connected TV users at 182.6 million, or 55.5 percent of the
U.S. population. In 2022, the number is expected to rise to 204.1
million, or 60.1 percent of the population. While smart TVs have been
around for a while now (Samsung
unveiled[https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-16483715] theirs back in
2008), adoption rates have really picked up in the last few years,
forcing marketers to determine how to include connected TV in their
marketing budgets. And for marketers wondering whether it’s a fad or a
trend, CTV is surely here to stay.

India, March 18 -- You don't have to be a sci-fi movie buff to
anticipate what the world around you is going to look like in the
future. Why future technologies like Artificial Intelligence and Machine
Learning are already in prevalence and here to stay.

Digital disruptions have already had a huge impact on diverse
industries. According to a Harvard Business Review report, a whopping
90% of industries claim to have a digital strategy in place. Studies
have revealed that by 2025, most industries will be completely
digitalised. So where does it leave managers with degrees from leading
management schools?

Gender-neutral retailer The Phluid Project opens its social code with,
“We celebrate what makes us different and we cherish what makes us the
same.” It’s a mantra that’s infused at the company, and practiced by its
founder, Rob Smith, every day.

Smith encourages everyone to “leave their assumptions at the door” as an
antidote to ignorance-based fear. And it’s working. The retail store is
evolving into a brand as well as a social movement. Here, as part of an
ongoing series of executive interviews, Tim Boerkoel, founder of global
executive search and strategic consulting firm The Brownestone Group,
talks with Smith about the origins of the company, what makes it tick,
and what informs his leadership style and approach.

* Sen. Bernie Sanders told NPR it's "nonsense" when people on the
political right attempt to characterize democratic socialism as
"authoritarianism and communism and Venezuela."

* Socialism remains a divisive term in US politics, and the presidential
hopeful signaled he needs to do a "better job" explaining what it really
means.

to violent images of the New Zealand shooting uploaded to the site.

Branded pubs failed to make the cut in a list of the UK’s number one
“most fun” leisure brands, with the likes of Wagamama and TGI Fridays
taking the top spots as the best restaurants.

However, within the report compiled by OC&C Fundex, Mitchells &
Butlers-owned Miller & Carter and café bar group Loungers each ranked
second.

Coca-Cola Amatil has said it is not pursuing the purchase of Kirin's
Australia-based food and beverage unit.

In a stock exchange filing posted late last week, CCA moved to silence
speculation that it is investigating the acquisition of Lion Drinks &
Dairy. In September, Kirinlaunched a strategic review of the unit, with
confirmation that it had started the sale process coming a month later.

By now, millennials are growing accustomed to getting blamed for pretty
much everything. The end of marriage, the end of divorce, the end of sex
and the end of relationships; the demise of cinema and the rise of PC
culture. The list goes on. But it's in the culinary world that
Generation Y suffers the most virulent accusations.

Everything from the decline of
pubs[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/food-and-drink/pubs-and-bars/clean-living-millennials-really-blame-death-pub-culture/]
to the end of tuna is routinely laid at the hands of those born between
1981 and 1996. The latest grumble concerns HP Sauce. According to a poll
by luxury hotel chain Guoman Hotels, just 14 per cent of 16 to
24-year-olds (most of whom, it should be noted, are not millennials but
*Generation Z*), would select the condiment as their favourite Full
English accompaniment. The number for older generations was 26 per cent.

Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook, when he achieved that assessment.

The next day, Jenner was back to work in Los Angeles, talking to his 128
million followers on Instagram. In a black dress with thin straps and
makeup on her cheeks, she announced that: "my powdered makeup will be
launched on Thursday - two weeks ago -".

For decades, Indian kids’ channels were surviving on syndicated foreign
cartoons and content. That model is no longer viable for young children
who can now access a wide variety of content on digital platforms. In
tune with the changed environment, Discovery Kids reinvented its content
strategy, to create a new animated show called Little Singham, based on
the popular cop franchise movies. “The show disrupted the kids genre,
and in a hyper competitive market with 15 channels, we grew to number 2
rank from number 9,” said Uttam Pal Singh, business head of Discovery
Kids at FICCI Frames, talking on capturing GenZ and millennials. As the
popularity of the Little Singham brand increased, the producers utilized
the high loyalty rate amongst kids to comonetise and launch a game that
is all set to hit 10 million downloads. Ronnie Screwvala, a film
producer and the former owner of UTV, said that TV has been unable to
catch the attention span of children.

BENGALURU: Brick-and-mortar retailers such as Lifestyle International,
Shoppers Stop and Arvind Fashions are tweaking their merchandise mix or
using technology to attract younger consumers who shop online.“The
footfall of 18-22 year olds shrank by about 4% last year,” said Vasanth
Kumar, managing director of Lifestyle International, adding that tablets
to browse collections, a digital fitting-room assistant to alert the
staff for product sizes and smart self-checkout services have been
installed at key locations. “Making the time-starved and tech-savvy
segment come to the store is our focus this year. The tech initiatives
have been made keeping millennials in mind to reduce their pain
points.”India has a median population age of 27.3 years compared with 35
years for China and about 47 years for Japan and it is estimated that
the country has about 390 million millennials and about 440 million in
the *Gen-Z* cohort, according to a recent study by consulting firm Deloitte.
