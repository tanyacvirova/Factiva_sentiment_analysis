(GlobeNewswire) - Suitably, a new direct-to-consumer workwear brand for
early career women, launches today with work wardrobe staples with fair
pricing. Founded by Annabel Gatto, Suitably is looking to bring better
fit and functionality, improved pricing, and greater simplification to
the cluttered womens workwear category.

Gatto was inspired to launch Suitably by her own early career working on
Wall Street and at a corporate law firm. Throughout her professional
career, she was often frustrated by the painful experience of shopping
for workwear and the lack of resources available to help women succeed
in the workplace. Shes launching the company with her husband Phil
Gatto, who will serve as COO.

Big alcohol brands are following, not leading. And where they are headed
is alternative drink categories, many of them 'hard' versions of
nonalcoholic beverages.

Hard seltzer surpassed $500-million in sales in 2019, according to
consumer research firm Nielsen, growing more than 200 percent in 2019.
It took a bite out of light beer sales and contributed to a decline in
the volume of wine purchases in the United States, the first drop since
1994. For the Super Bowl, Bud Light debuted Bud Light Seltzer
commercials, a 5 percent alcohol beverage offered in four fruity
flavors. California wine giant Barefoot has made the biggest investment
in its 55-year history to launch four white wine-based seltzers in the
first quarter of this year.

A good strategy is to minimise worry about external events and focus on
personal goals

In the current turbulent global political climate, a job or a career for
life for those just starting out in the workplace is no longer
guaranteed — or even desirable. Add in the climate crisis and wider
anxiety about the future, and the feeling of worry and lack of control
could potentially become overwhelming.

A fter the UK Labour party's humiliating general election defeat,
"moderate" Democratic presidential candidates and commentators in the US
urged the Democrats to learn the lessons of Brexit and Donald Trump:
don't veer too far-left and make radical promises.

Meanwhile, Steve Bannon, the president's former adviser, correctly
reminded progressives in Britain and the US that "Brexit and Trump were
inextricably linked in 2016". He then provocatively and incorrectly
added: "They are inextricably linked today."

Before claims of catastrophic global warming became in vogue, climate
"experts " warned of a cooling trend leading to a new ice age. The
compilation below documents some of the failed climate predictions
regarding both global cooling and global warming. Obviously ominous
warnings regarding the latter are being issued right up to the present
day -perhaps more frequently and stridently than ever. Yet enough time
has now gone by to completely discredit earlier global-warming claims.

The failure of the particular predictions we have compiled in the
global-warming section is self-evident. For example, we all know that
the Arctic ice cap has never disappeared during the summer months,
despite A l Gore s claim that this could have happened as early as 2013.
Moreover, at present, there is no solid evidence that recent claims of
impending climate catastrophe are any more likely to be accurate than
past claims.

January 2020 and the start of a new year and decade. Many of us have
thrown ourselves into fresh new work challenges, ﬁtness regimes and
diets, add in the busy hectic routine of a life in hospitality and
before you know it, we're into February and it's Valentine’s
Day[https://www.hoteliermiddleeast.com/pics-22836-14-valentines-day-getaways-for-february-14].
For the cynics amongst us, Valentine’s is now often seen as a commercial
celebration where roses are overpriced and restaurants put on special
couples' menus at premium rates, but for many of us it is a wonderful
occasion to come out of the January grind and appreciate the one we love
with a gift, spa break, weekend away or date night — and why not?

The coronavirus has sparked fear among global investors
[https://proxylibrary.hse.ru:2556/articles/everything-investors-need-to-know-about-coronavirus-51580332568],
who worry that this could be the dreaded black swan that trips up the
financial markets.

It has also fanned concern among some Americans who suspect that the bug
could be spread by the communal activity that will reach a high on Super
Bowl Sunday.

This year, apart from regular flirty campaigns, brands are seen
expressing love that knows no boundaries; be that of colour, community,
age, or gender. Here are a few that stood out

As February enters, there's some magic in the air, and the young, and
the not so young, all wait for Valentine's Day, February 14, the day of
love. Brands also work to build their communication to cash in on the
special occasion, days before the D Day arrives.

Challenger brands, non-bank lenders and even no-branch banks have joined
the ranks of industry super funds and mortgage brokers on the winners
podium as they scoop up billions of dollars in loans and deposits as
customers shy away from the incumbents.

In 2019, the big four banks grew their mortgage books at 1.8 per cent,
or around half the rate of system growth at 3.1 per cent, while smaller
banks let lending rip at speeds in the double digits and non-bank
lenders are hitting 15 per cent, according to the Reserve Bank of Australia.

With tax season officially open as of Jan. 27, taxpayers may feel a
familiar sense of anxiety. In fact, about 1 in 3 taxpayers told Credit
Karma Tax in a recent survey they typically get anxious about prepping
their taxes.

Tax anxieties are higher among younger Americans, with the survey
finding that more than 40% of the millennial and *Generation Z* groups
experience tax anxiety, compared with fewer than 30% of Generation X.
The reason could be tied to experience, since Gen X – taxpayers between
about 40 to 55 – have many more years of filing returns under their belt.

Social commerce marketplace Poshmark is growing into new categories
beyond women’s apparel and accessories, into home décor and men’s
apparel. The launch of the men’s category is proving a smart move.

“It’s going to surprise some, but men love fashion just as much as
women. We’re seeing a massive explosion in how much men are adopting
resale,” said Tracy Sun, co-founder and svp of new markets at Poshmark,
at NRF’s Retail’s Big Show.

Change sounds like this: South Korean director Bong Joon Ho accepted his
foreign film award for “Parasite” at the Golden Globes, saying: “Once
you overcome the 1-inch-tall barrier of subtitles, you will be
introduced to so many more amazing films.”

Bong’s statement echoes Alfonso Cuarón’s comments last year when he took
the foreign-language Oscar for “Roma”: “I grew up watching
foreign-language films and learning so much from them — films like
‘Citizen Kane,’ ‘Jaws,’ ‘Rashomon,’ ‘The Godfather’ and ‘Breathless.’ ”

2020 FEB 3 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at
Journal of Engineering -- National Research Group (NRG), a leading
global insights and strategy firm with 40 years of media, entertainment
and technology expertise, released a new study uncovering excitement for
Visual Search as a discovery tool, with strong future potential for
information discovery, retail and social use cases.

Visual search is changing how consumers shop, share and navigate the
world around them. Through in-depth interviews with industry experts,
qualitative research among leading-edge consumers and a quantitative
survey among a nationally representative sample, the study, Visual
Search: A Disruptor for Retail, Social and Beyond in 2020, proves strong
demand for more intuitive ways to find inspiration and information, with
7 in 10 consumers who are aware of Visual Search telling us they are
likely to try it.

2020 FEB 3 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at
Journal of Engineering -- It has been 30 years since the end of the Cold
War, yet, on average, Americans still perceive that the odds of a
nuclear weapon detonating on U.S. soil is as likely as a coin toss,
according to new research from Stevens Institute of Technology.

"That's exceptionally high," said Kristyn Karl, a political scientist at
Stevens who co-led the work with psychologist Ashley Lytle. "People
don't generally believe that highly rare events are slightly less likely
than a 50/50 tossup."

This past year, TikTok (formerly Musical.ly) hit 800 million users,
according to a pitch deck leaked by Ad Age.

Users are Gen-Zers, with 41% aged 16-24, living in 154 countries,
according to a report in Influencer Marketing Hub. While information on
what the Chinese app company is really earning is scarce, it's reported
that 42% of revenue is coming from the U.S., with over 14 million unique
visitors last year.

Launched in early 2018, PepsiCo sparkling water Bubly got a big brand
recognition boost with its humorous 2019 Super Bowl ad featuring singer
Michael Bublé.

But Bubly decided to skip this year's advertising/football spectacle in
favor of a new television ad with Bublé that broke today and continues
his obsession with the way Bubly is pronounced -- the and way he thinks
it should be spelled.

*HD* 	Can you dance and cry at the same time? These songs show that it
is possible

"A sad banger is a subject with which you can cry as much as dance. It's
sad and uplifting at the same time." This is how Mark Ronson (London,
1975) explained in the middle of this year what kind of songs his last
album, Late night feelings, contained. "It's my divorce record, but at
the same time it's a DJ record," she stressed. Sad bangers are not new.
Some go back to Billie Holiday to find the origin of this kind of
depressing song that makes you dance. But that may be excessive.

In the music, if by the purists were, everything would have started in
the same place and at the same time. Thus, the true origin of the sad
banger may be found in the late seventies, when the disco anthem I will
survive, by Gloria Gaynor (the mother of all sad bangers), and Train in
vain, of The Clash (the sad banger with which the pu farewell was
farewelled, farewelled the nk). Years later, Ultravox would make the
genre literal with Dancing with tears in my eyes.

If one of Grace Beverley’s 10 employees breaks up with their partner and
doesn't feel chipper enough to come into work, they’re welcome to stay
home and rest up. If they have a dog, every day is Take Your Pet to Work
Day, and they can sleep soundly at night knowing that the business they
work for takes every effort to be “sustainable, ethical, inclusive,
diverse and at a good price point”.

This is business *Gen Z*-style, as championed by Grace Beverley who, at
the tender age of 22, already has three companies under her portfolio
which last year had an 8 million pound turnover, with last month marking
her first “one million month”.

We take some industries for granted, great big dumb things that people
get used to, part of life as they know it. Retail, restaurants, hotels,
and airlines believe they can change lumpishly, thoughtlessly, and at
glacial speed in order to resemble their cheaper disruptive rivals. We
can see the pattern in the carpet and it is panic.

We know about retail vs. Amazon. Amazon is deteriorating now, failing to
stock, discount and deliver products the way it used to. But since
Amazon's carpet bombing of shops, we have little to fall back on.

Dry January participants used to have two options. Hunch over a lime and
soda in the pub, or stay in, counting the days until February.

In 2020, "not drinking" looks very different. There are sober bars in
London (including one from Scottish brewersBrewdog), a raft of
no-alcohol or low-ABV beers, wines and spirits, and sophisticated
booze-free cocktails at leading bars and restaurants.

In case you haven't noticed, Bitmojis have evolved.

They used to be Bitstrips, or user-generated stickers meant to be shared
on Facebook. Then they became more like emoji, the little animated
characters within your keyboard to be used when words alone just aren't
enough.

As a result of a new social paradigm in which almost everything is paid
electronically, *generation Z* kids grow up away from cash. Some even
make it to almost high school without the real need to manage money,
because it is the parents who take care of the payments and, so, they
grow up without learning to manage their money. What are the
z-generation parents like when it comes to giving their children money?
THE NATION consulted different specialists and thus a categorization
emerged that allows to identify with the various models of paternity and
finance. Crocodile, investor or ATM? In what style is each
reflected?Before Sofia Aristobulus, 12, got into her best friend's
family car to go with them to Punta del Este, Ana, her mother, had
already given her Uruguayan pesos to have for expenses during those ten
days. I was nervous because until now, beyond the money for the school
kiosk, Sofia didn't drive cash.

The TikTok app was created to share short videos, from 10 to 60 seconds.
If we install it on our cell phones we access a zapping of teenagers
inside the bathroom, sharing lyrics of trendy songs while doing karaoke
and putting on funny faces. But, against the wishes of the owners of
this platform, TikTok is becoming a political forum. A few weeks ago,
tiktoker Feroza Aziz was teaching beauty classes while criticizing the
Chinese government's mistreatment of her Muslim prisoners. Other issues
such as the fires in Australia, the murder of Qassem Soleimani or global
warming appear disguised in a song or loom surprised in the middle of
their videos.They are the young people of *generation Z* (that of people
born between 1995 and 2005) who express theself with sarcasm, that
generational brand. They are the boys of reggaeton - the one with the
indefensible lyrics - but also the generation of Greta Thunberg, the
ecological militancy and the colored scarf.

It has been an unusually quiet start to the new year, with most
organisations showing caution against the backdrop of a weak economy and
liquidity pressures. While that may be the case, emphasis on creating
radical productivity shifts at the workplace will continue in 2020. So,
what will change at our workplace?

U.S., Feb. 2 -- Leading technology experts, discuss business priorities
for industries in 2020.

The end of 2019 marks the close of a decade that has seen technology
advances soar. Since 2010 we've witnessed the development and adoption
of technologies like the iPad, Amazon Alexa, driverless cars and
near-field communication (NFC) to name just a few, all of which allow
for a wealth of possibilities. Meanwhile the behind-the-scenes tech has
been on just as impressive a journey. As we approach 2020, we spoke with
15 IT experts to hear their thoughts on what technologies businesses
should prioritise in the coming year, and the impact of the advancements
made over this past year.

Perak said she could not believe that she had won such a large sum in
the BSN SSP December 2019 special lucky draw. “I have been saving with
BSN since the 1990s. “At that time, I earned only a small wage, but I
still put some money in my account. “Last month, I received a call from
my neighbour, who works at BSN in Perak. “He told me that he had some
good news for me. I was cooking lunch at that time. “He came to my house
and informed me that I had won RM2 million in the lucky draw. “Of
course, I did not believe him until he showed me the bank’s letter and
matched my identification card number with the one in the letter. “I was
speechless,” she said at the BSN SSP December 2019 lucky draw
prize-giving ceremony at the BSN headquarters here.

By now, most recent observers in the mainland fashion industry have seen
countless examples of brands and designers overtly and proudly embracing
their Chinese identity.

However, a number of Chinese brands are bucking that trend and wearing
European inspirations unambiguously on their sleeves.

Young Australians may be having less sex than most other demographics,
but their changing attitudes look more like creative disruption than crisis

In 2019 the idea of a millennial and *Gen Z* “sex recession” became
fact. Or it became the 2019 version of a fact: something we all (myself
included) absorb after reading viral headlines on Facebook.

It's hard to believe it's been 20 years since my sister and I tried to
load the first Sims game onto our crusty old Dell desktop. It took
forever. We sat side by side, passing the time by watching the loading
bar creep forward. After what seemed like an eternity, it was time to play.

The
Sims[https://www.gamespot.com/videos/the-history-of-the-sims/2300-6441894/]
is a life simulation game from EA released in 2000 that has more than
proved its staying power. Developers Maxis and Electronic Arts have
steadily released multiple sequels, dozens of expansions, spin-offs,
console and handheld versions. In 2016, The Sims landed a spot in the
World Video Game Hall of
Fame[https://www.museumofplay.org/press/releases/2016/05/2688-2016-world-video-game-hall-fame-inductees-announced].
The series surpassed $5 billion in lifetime sales last November.

Back in the Eighties and Nineties, female pop stars were different.
While today's lady crooners are all about the obvious forms of youthful
sex appeal - think about the glossy limbs and pouts of Taylor Swift,
Miley Cyrus, Rihanna - the female sell-outs of the good old days could
be wild and weird as well as sexy.

Nobody encapsulated the brain-splitting possibilities of female
musicianship better than the Material Girl herself. So for those of us
who grew up with her in her prime, Madonna's show at the Palladium in
London last week was a big deal - as is every brush with the woman who
brought Like a Virgin to the world.

Ispend quite a bit of time scrolling through dating apps for the same
reason I watch Love Island religiously: to grasp social trends I'd
otherwise be too snootily removed to notice. With the dating apps, of
course, there's always the (very) unrealistic hope that my very own Mr
Darcy will appear.

Be that as it may, one of the growing trends I've noticed on the apps is
astrology among the young and hip. Just as often as not, the
twentysomething Joes, Toms and Jacks of app-land, who post very little
about themselves, want you to know their star sign. Perhaps millennials
find astrology comforting in an age of labyrinthine communication,
uncertain finances, environmental crises and self-obsession. And not
just millennials: I was at a dinner party the other week and a gay man
in his 40s, very hip, very successful in the arts, repeatedly mused on
the progress of the moons. An ultra-feminist academic colleague of mine
in her late 30s refers frequently to birth charts.

India, Feb. 2 -- At an event last year, Janhvi Kapoor casually mentioned
to a stunned audience that she had temporarily given up non-vegetarian
food as part of a mannat she took in the hope of getting a role. "Kaafi
sanskari ladki hoon main, mini skirt mein!" the 22-year-old actor joked.
But she wasn't really joking. The Bollywood-born daughter of the late
superstar Sridevi and producer Boney Kapoor has been exploring
spirituality and religion over the last year or so. It seems to bring
her closer to her mother.

"Mom was always very, very religious," says Janhvi. "And I think I have
become much more religious since she passed away (Sridevi died on 24
February 2018). I somehow feel closer to her when I do things that were
so much part of her."

Patrick Schwarzenegger is an ambitious 26-year-old movie star who has
made millions on the side with a pizza chain. Is he destined to eclipse
his father? Jane Mulkerrins finds out

‘There are always going to be people who say: ‘You only got that movie
role because of your dad. You’re only doing really well in business
because you came from money. You’re only waking up at 5.30am because
your dad taught you to.’ I work my ass off,” asserts 26-year-old Patrick
Schwarzenegger. “I’m up before 99 per cent of people, and I grind. And
when people say those things, I just think to myself, ‘Let them say what
they want. I’m going to keep grinding.’ ” He takes a long, deep gulp on
his $12 (£9) orange sunrise smoothie (coconut milk, mango, almond butter
and frozen banana, with optional spirulina), and asks the passing
waitress if she could add some chlorophyll to our water. “I buy into it
all,” he says with a grin.

When Leonard Steinhorn hosted Thanksgiving at his Logan Circle apartment
in November, a friend and fellow baby boomer surprised the 20-somethings
in attendance with special gifts: T-shirts printed with the viral
put-down 'OK boomer.' *Generation Z*'s mocking dismissal of out-of-touch
old people had ricocheted across the Internet earlier that month, and
playing it up in front of Steinhorn doubled as a good-natured inside
joke: The longtime American University communication professor, and
author of the 2006 tome 'The Greater Generation: In Defense of the Baby
Boom Legacy,' is perhaps the nation's biggest boomer booster.

It's the app that's changing the way we shop, bringing preloved fashion
to the masses. Now one of the industry's rising stars, London designer
Richard Quinn, is collaborating. Welcome to the Depop generation

IF YOU'RE OVER A CERTAIN AGE, it's unlikely you've encountered the
community-driven marketplace Depop — it has become a byword for a
certain type of *gen Z* thrift style, as about 90% of its active users
are under 26. Among that generation its reach is vast: it has 17 million
registered users in more than 147 countries, and in the UK, its home
base, a third of 15- to 24-year-olds are on the platform. Sellers range
from those flogging the odd piece of bedroom-floor detritus to serious
entrepreneurs. Its top sellers make six figures annually from their
hauls — often up-selling charity shop or car boot finds.

Despite New-Year resolutions to eat healthily, for professionals and
millennials who regularly depend on food from outside, all the nutrition
talk might seem futile.

Not anymore, as savvy foodies show us the way. These extra-conscious
food lovers are now reliant on knowledgeable chefs to serve them healthy
options and portions. And guess what? Many chefs seem to be willingly
turning into part-time nutritionists so they can consider the
nutritional value of local ingredients, and recommend patrons healthy
food-based trends including vegan, gluten-free and organic.

2 COMMENTARY In an age of instant experience, whv does social change
take so long? I can name Emma's favorite foods: roasted sweet potatoes
and acai smoothie bowls. Emma Abrahamson is one of the countless
*Generation Z* video bloggers on YouTube (some with tens of millions of
followers) who are re-creating the nature of human friendship and
experience. Some worry that such a technology-centered existence, filled
with YouTube friends and instantaneous everything, leaves young people
isolated and ill-equipped to live with uncertainty.

1 Innovation in PropTech: Technology has shaped the real estate
industry. In 2020, we will continue to see new and innovative
technologies emerge, especially at a property and property management
level. A few examples include automating processes, texting and instant
messaging between management and residents or potential residents,
analyzing and collecting big data, and virtual tours, among others.

2 Online Reputation Management: More than half of today's prospective
residents look to online reviews as they begin their search for an
apartment. This makes it extremely crucial for property managers to
actively monitor the online reputation of an apartment community,
including monitoring and responding to online reviews quickly and
promptly. In 2020, sophisticated property managers will take a more
strategic approach to online reputation management, incorporating tools
and software to help successfully address and monitor online reviews for
all the communities they manage.

When Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae slowed multifamily lending in the late
summer and early in the fall, the repercussions were felt throughout the
rental housing sector.

But with rising defaults already an issue, the GSEs' pullback hit the
student market especially hard. "Lending is an issue in student
[housing] right now and it is freezing the market," says Ari Rosenblum,
Co-Founder and CEO, Vie Management.

As *Gen Z* replaces Millennials on college and university campuses,
owners, developers and managers of student housing are studying the
numbers and habits of this younger cohort, born between 1995 and 2012.
They want to be sure they build and remodel the right number of student
housing communities in the best locations and with the right number of
beds and amenities.

The key to smart building and remodeling is to carefully research where
enrollment looks most promising and identifying the most appealing
features. "Both students and their parents have high expectations," says
David Adelman, CEO of Campus Apartments in Philadelphia.

Spending others' money as if it were one's own isn't successful
politics. Yet notwithstanding Congress' current appetite for
trillion-dollar annual deficits, there are limits to federal
spending--especially on Amtrak, which labors perennially for but a
miniscule portion.

Presidents Reagan and both Bushes recommended zeroing-out Amtrak
funding, Presidents Clinton and Trump sought 23% cuts, and Amtrak
opponents in Congress are too numerous to list.

A look at the demise of suburban office parks, and what's being done to
bring them back to life.

The theory that history repeats itself is a tangible one, at least in
terms of New Jersey's commercial real estate landscape, as the
"comeback" of suburban office parks alongside exciting mixed-use
developments continues to flourish.

As traditional retail reels under the effects of slow consumer demand
and increasing dependency on e-commerce, the resale or recommerce
industry is basking in the glory of unparalleled growth, taking the
world of retail by storm. The budding prospects of something that is not
only a lucrative opportunity but also helps create a more sustainable
platform for consumption, has caught the eye of many. With new ventures
mushrooming throughout the world, their success is inspirational for
many retail conglomerates looking to turn more eco-friendly.Recommerce,
although previously an obscure concept, is being looked at with a vastly
different perspective now that the world has clamoured enough about the
disastrous impact of the fashion industry on environment.As discussed in
a previous article of AOI, both Millennials and *Generation-Z* are
embracing the concept of purchasing second-hand goods.

As Victoria's Secret continues to try regain its footing as the
once-premiere lingerie brand, news this week of a potential sale has
reignited questions around its ability to bounce back from the blows
it's suffered over the past few years. According to The Wall Street
Journal[https://proxylibrary.hse.ru:2346/articles/victorias-secret-billionaire-in-talks-to-step-aside-and-sell-brand-11580299200],
which cites sources close to the company, longtime CEO Leslie Wexner is
preparing to leave, and, at the same time, is exploring strategic
alternatives for the 43-year-old brand.

Victoria's Secret has not responded to The Hollywood Reporter's request
for comment, nor has it confirmed the sale officially. But if it does go
through, it would be the latest in a string of moves to try to improve
its image and save its falling sales. Last year, the company said it
would shut more than 50 stores, with more expected to close this year.

Heightened geopolitical tensions, increasingly divergent national policy
positions, technological advances and shifting consumer preferences all
suggest more turbulence ahead for global energy markets, write Richard
Forrest, Partner at A T Kearney, Romain Debarre, Managing Director of
the Energy Transition Institute and Erik Peterson, Managing Director of
the Global Business Policy Council.

The world needs more energy and whilst fossil fuels will continue to
play a major role, the pace of change required to decarbonise continues
to increase. At the same time, a more engaged consumer is creating new
momentum, and the pressure on policy makers to act has never been
greater. This ‘dual challenge’ of needing more energy with less carbon
will continue to be the issue oil and gas companies need to address in
short- and long-term choices, and 2020 will be a pivotal year.

The question of what role oil and gas companies should have in investor
portfolios, or whether they belong at all, has never been more pressing.
The world is not on track to meet the goals set out by the 2015 Paris
Agreement and the sense of urgency in dealing with increasing greenhouse
gas (GHG) emissions is rising rapidly.

According to a recent report from Barclays – entitled Rewarding low
carbon – many oil and gas companies are embarking on initiatives in the
low carbon economy. While more needs to be done, the study concludes
that aligning portfolios with a 2°C world should not rule out holdings
in the energy sector.

Bradley Corp. has released the findings of its latest handwashing
survey, conducted annually for more than a decade. According to the
organization, Americans' concerns about contracting the flu have grown
over time; 60% of respondents are extremely or quite concerned about
catching the flu this year, as compared to 32% who felt that way 4 years
ago. Among all age groups, Mil-lennials expressed the most concern about
getting sick, according to Bradley.

In addition, the survey found that in response to flu outbreaks,
Americans become more conscientious about handwashing when they are in
public spaces. Nearly 80% say they wash their hands more frequently,
more thoroughly or longer after using a public restroom. On the first
survey conducted in 2009, only 45% said they increased their hand
hygiene in response to virus outbreaks.

direct-to-con-sumer (DTC) brand offering shaving supplies and body care
formulas for women.

P&G said the deal complements its female grooming portfolio, which
includes the Venus, Braun and Joy brands, through the combination of
strong digital and direct-to-consumer marketing capabilities, a growing
range of personal care products, and a fresh, digitally-native brand
that is especially appealing to Millennial and *Gen Z* consumers. Billie
will continue to be led by its co-founders, Georgina Gooley and Jason

IT COULD be that the days are over when bathroom cabinets were packed
with skin care products, as Europeans move away from complicated daily
routines toward a simpler approach based on fewer, more effective
products. Sustainability is also a motivating factor, as consumers
consider the impact that using multiple products has on the environment.

European facial skin care is a mature market and sales growth has been
modest, notes Euromonitor International, which predicted total European
skin care market sales would top $20.6 billion last year, an increase of
1.6% year-on-year. Western Europe accounts for the majority of sales at
81% of the total, a market that is dominated by Germany (more than $4
billion), France (nearly $3 billion) and the UK (nearly $2.9 billion).
Russia is the largest East European market for facial skin care at more
than $1.7 billion, accounting for nearly half of all sales for this
region, while Poland comes a distant second at $796 million.

FOR YEARS the beauty industry spotlight has been on South Korea for its
mold-breaking beauty innovations best known as K-Beauty; but now China,
Japan and other Asian markets are attracting the attention of the global
beauty community.

Sales of beauty and personal care products in the Asia-Pacific region
are strong and expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 7%
between 2018 and 2023, according to market research provider,
Euromonitor International. China and Thailand will be the
fastest-growing markets in the region at 9% apiece, while Taiwan and
Singapore will grow by 4% and South Korea and Japan each growing 3%.

Appropriate gerontological social work services are, amongst others,
dependent on social workers' knowledge of and attitudes toward older
persons. The current cohort of students, known as *Generation Z*, are
global citizens. This study determined and described South African
undergraduate social work students' knowledge of and attitudes toward
older persons. A cross-sectional survey was undertaken with B Social
Work students (N = 395) at two universities. Data collection included
the three scales of Palmore's First Facts of Aging Quiz in
multiple-choice format (1996) and four scales of Fraboni's Scale of
Agism (1990). Age and five categorical factors were considered to
determine their simultaneous impact on each of the seven
scales/subscales of the two instruments by performing multi-way ANOVA
models. An unexpected finding was that the factor 'completed a course in
gerontology' did not have any impact on any scale.

Smokers cost U.S. employers $170 billion for medical care, and more than
$156 billion from lost productivity every year, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention estimates. One company is trying a drastic way to
cut down on its healthcare costs.

U-Haul late last year said it would no longer consider job prospects who
use nicotine products in 21 states where it is legal to do so. U-Haul's
policy went into effect in February, providing a test case on whether
the strategy will be effective in lowering healthcare costs - and
whether it will unleash a backlash. The strategy may present a slippery
slope for employers. If smokers can be banned, what about alcoholics,
the obese and those deemed to be unhealthy? And who would determine that?

Millennial employees are projected to make up 50% of the U.S. workforce
this year and to grow to 75% of the work pool by 2030, according to the
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

As this influx of millennial employees begins to take over far-reaching
industries, companies, large enterprises and human resource managers are
getting creative in their benefits options to help keep their employees
working, happy and staying put.

In the revolt against fast fashion, younger people are adopting the
errand of their grandparents and making a trip to their local tailor.

Molly Barrington, 29, has been working as a tailor in Melbourne since
2017, recently moving her shop from the CBD to St Kilda. She thinks
people in her demographic are "definitely becoming more aware" of
tailors, probably wanting to be less wasteful with their wardrobes.

Younger generations tend to take a bolder approach to pay negotiations
than their older colleagues, although many *Gen Z* workers get
uncomfortable when asked about salary expectations, a new survey revealed.

Almost 60 percent of *Gen Z* workers and the same amount of Millennial
workers have used a potential job offer to negotiate a higher salary
with a current employer, according to the Randstad 2020 U.S.
Compensation Insights
survey[https://rlc.randstadusa.com/for-business/learning-center/future-workplace-trends/randstad-compensation-insights-1].

As Prince Harry, Meghan Markle and their son Archie begin their new life
in Canada away from the agenda and the English royal family, the British
press continues to secede in them, mainly in the exact, to which they
blame the breakup.

But what's behind these criticisms? Some even see racism, given his
mulatto status.

The way we work won't be the same. The way we get around won't be the
same. The way we live won't be the same.

By 2030, even we won't be the same, not after the arrival of a million
new faces, lifting Greater Toronto's population to eight million. Not
after the changing of the generational guard, as the last of the Baby
Boom retires, passing leadership to younger, more diverse, more
digitally dexterous hands.

What a flabby and unfocused doorstopper. And what a waste of a saleable
title to boot.

With the vanguard of boomers — the largest and wealthiest generation in
human history — well into their seventh decade, a natural market exists
for a book called Successful Aging.
