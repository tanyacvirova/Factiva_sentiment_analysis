WHAT: Scoff all you want about *Gen X* and millennials, but here’s a
nugget to pass on about those much-maligned generations: They are the
cohort that will pick the collecting “gets” of the future. Further, by
the time the rest of us get ready to cash in our curated treasures, they
will already have moved on to even more recent items.

Consider the recent sale of a circa 1970s Weltron “GEC 2005” stereo
system at Urban Culture Auctions. A Jetson-like spaceship perched on a
pedestal, the turntable AM/FM stereo radio and 8-track tape deck with
internal speakers plus external auxiliary ports estimated presale to
sell for $300 to $500 soared to an astounding $7,800 (including the
buyer’s premium). And no one knew if it still worked! Maybe it was the
appeal of its clear injection molded disc-shaped dome lid that did the
trick.

Bret Easton Ellis is no stranger to bad publicity. Ever since his 1985
debut, “Less Than Zero,” made him a literary sensation, his violently
nihilistic fiction and his politically incorrect public persona have
earned him as much fury as acclaim. And after three decades, five
subsequent novels and a story collection, a podcast and more than a
handful of media spats, Ellis still has more to say. On April 16, he
will publish his first book in nine years — and his nonfiction debut —
an essay collection called
“White.”[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/17/books/review/bret-easton-ellis-white.html]
Not everybody is going to like it. He doesn’t care.

“I feel very loose about this,” he said. “This is kind of a book for a
Bret Easton Ellis completist.”

Rob Thomas breaks down his upcoming solo album, Chip Tooth Smile (due
April 26th) along with the whole rest of his career on the latest
episode of our podcast, Rolling Stone Music Now. In an in-depth
interview with host Brian Hiatt at our SiriusXM studio, Thomas touches
on his short-lived pre-Matchbox Twenty band Tabitha’s Secret, how weed
has helped his songwriting, the advantages of middle age, balancing his
solo career with his band, the ’80s influences on his new LP, the trials
of *Gen-X* and much more. With the 20th anniversary of “Smooth”
approaching, he also details the making of that song, what it was like
dealing with its ubiquity (he got sick of it for a while), and Carlos
Santana’s unexpectedly heavy use of emojis in their text exchanges.

Arecent video[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm2szuXKgL8] from Will
Smith confirmed a longstanding piece of Hollywood trivia: He was the
first choice to play Neo, the lead role in the Wachowskis’ The Matrix,
but he turned it down. The decision was one he says he’s “not proud of,”
but his reasoning was simple—he didn’t understand the pitch he received
from the filmmakers at all. “‘Imagine you’re in a fight,’” Smith recalls
the sibling director duo telling him during a meeting. “‘And then you,
like, jump—and imagine if you could stop jumping in the middle of the
jump.’” Smith might be exaggerating for comedy’s sake, but the thrust of
his explanation for rejecting the part makes sense. Which prompts a
question: In a risk-averse business like Hollywood, how did a movie like
The Matrix—demanding in terms of both concept and cost—get made in the
first place?

UPDATE, 2nd SUNDAY AM Update 9:30AM after 8:08AM post: With chart
Disney’s Dumbo didn’t leave a big footprint with a meh $45M opening
after a $17.5M Saturday, which, next to Friday-plus previews, is +16%.
This is not one of the better openings for a tentpole-conceived live
action remake of a Disney ‘toon from a marquee director. After shelling
out $170M to make a movie based on a 78-year old Disney cornerstone
character, this can’t be celebrated as a grand slam in the wake of
Beauty and the Beast, Jungle Book, Cinderella, and Maleficent.
Sorry, Dumbo didn’t soar, but he wasn’t completely grounded either.
Disney is calling Dumbo at $45M, which is under the $50M+ start they
hoped for and the crazy $60M estimates a couple of B.O. analysts were
seeing.

As we said in the previous update, Dumbo wasn’t a case of the studio
fumbling marketing. He’s just an old, melancholy elephant, even if he
does fly, and, well, that’s not a sell-out.

For weeks now I’ve been seeing a persistent rumor circulating in social
media: that the prophet of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints, Russell M. Nelson, is about to lift the ban on members drinking
coffee and tea.

Now before I go on the record as saying that I think this rumor is, at
best, wishful thinking on the part of people who would like to gulp down
a guilt-free frappuccino, let me out myself as an utter failure at
giving credence to other early rumors when those rumors did, in fact,
wind up bearing fruit.

YOU know when a pair of runners are really cool? And all the cool kids
and hip bloggers have them? And then they get so cool that they become
ubiquitous and the parents of the cool kids and hip bloggers buy a kind
of less-cool Clarks version of them? And the parent says to their kid,
"Look! we can match!" and the kid rolls their eyes because no one
actually cool has worn those runners for a year now? For some reason the
news that the Central Statistics Office (CSO) is testing a question
about sexuality for the 2026 census giving options of heterosexual,
lesbian, gay or bisexual put me in mind of exactly that.

Are our children going to rescue us from this political hell? That
question has been asked, in varying tones of desperation, by a lot of us
older voters recently.

I heard it last week from the great British historian Simon Schama who,
while watching more than a million young people take to the streets of
London to urge their government to stay in the European Union, uttered
this hopeful prediction: “Brexit can't win because the overwhelming
majority of the young are against leaving and if forced to, without
getting a vote, will make it their life mission to reverse it and will
damn those who brought it about."

Film's success strikes a blow for both representation and the horror genre

Us, the new horror film from Jordan Peele (Get Out), is about a
middle-class family whose mirror images — eerily similar but also
enigmatic and very, very angry — show up to terrorize them.

In a kindergarten meeting, a teacher asks parents to role-play a PE
lesson, so that they get a feel of what their children learn in school.
It is awkward, more so for older parents. A few fathers and mothers in
the late 40s and 50s complain about the “childish exercise” while the
younger parents giggle as they remove their high-heels to play with
their children on grass.

As Kenyans delay having children, with some starting parenthood in their
mid-40s, playgrounds and kindergartens are having older parents who
sometimes find it hard to fit in.

Recent debates on the potential efficacy of the ‘Green New Deal’
proposed by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D, N.Y.) and other
members of Congress raise one central question for the financial advice
industry: Do typical green mutual funds and ETFs actually deliver a
direct and positive environmental impact?

2019 MAR 2 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at
Leisure & Travel Week -- Investigators discuss new findings in
Hospitality Management. According to news reporting from Hat Yai,
Thailand, by VerticalNews journalists, research stated, "This study
examines how corporate social responsibility (CSR) participation affects
organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) through meaningful work. This
work is significant for three reasons: the joint examination of CSR,
meaningful work, and OCB is novel; the comparative effects of CSR
perception versus CSR participation have not been examined previously;
and this is the first examination of such relationships for different
generations of employees."

Financial supporters for this research include Thailand Research Fund
(TRF), Prince of Songkla University (PSU) through the Research Grant for
New Scholars.

There is yet another misinformed debate about millennials —they don’t
care about saving for retirement.

The conventional perspective is that millennials aren’t planning for the
future; they’re happy to sacrifice financial stability for in-the-moment
living. Data to back up that opinion is mostly from surveys that track
how members of that generation feel, not what they do. Many of those
surveys present millennial data in isolation versus compare it to
cross-generational data.

Plant-based, protein and fiber trends remain in the top ten for 2019,
but consumer demand has expanded into personal connections and
‘adventurous’ discovery. Virginia Lee, insights and innovation manager
at Innova Market Insights, shared details and plenty of novel examples
at ProFood Tech in Chicago on March 26-28.

Lee emphasized discovery as the winning trend,

pointing to a $75 smoked watermelon that looked more like a ham.

Kors. But apart from an army of brands, what is it that sets apart a
luxury mall from a regular mall?

THERE are challenges that come with running the last Blockbuster Video
on the planet.

The computer system must be rebooted using floppy disks that only the
general manager – a solid member of *Gen X* – knows how to use. The
dot-matrix printer broke, so employees write out membership cards by
hand. And the store’s business transactions are backed up on a
reel-to-reel tape that can’t be replaced because Radio Shack went out of
business.

National Australia Bank's wealth management division MLC will "recommit"
to the financial advice business as it prepares to part ways with NAB
and be a standalone business.

MLC chief executive Geoff Lloyd said the "new MLC" would focus on
over-45s in the Australian market who have complex needs and who need a
trusted adviser.

Fewer than millennials and boomers, they're oft ignored

Their generation, they argue, has made countless societal contributions.
It produced Kurt Cobain and MTV. Gave the world the VCR, Nintendo, and

Levi Strauss & Co. is definitely having a moment. Be it the brand’s
well-received return to public markets, or its consistent appeal among
consumers, Levi’s hasn’t been short on successes.

And when it comes to sales, the brand is outperforming its competitors, too.

Jim Duffy loves his morning coffee but fears Britain has become a nation
of addicts and that can't be a good thing, right?

Here's one to wake you up in the morning... Did you know that by 2023
the UK is predicted to have ten times more baristas then barristers?
Nearly 200,000 baristas will be employed in the UK dishing up coffee for
a nation that is now well and truly hooked.

The latest Quinnipiac poll shows a familiar quartet at the top of
Democratic primary field — former vice president Joe Biden at 29
percent, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) at 19 percent, former congressman
Beto O'Rourke (D-Tex.) at 12 percent and Sen. Kamala D. Harris
(D-Calif.) at 8 percent — with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) at 4
percent tied with ... South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg (!).
Buttigieg is the only candidate to date who seems to have broken out of
obscurity, outpacing both Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Amy Klobuchar
(D-Minn.) at 2 percent each.

None of these numbers are predictive of the results of a single primary
or the race as a whole. Polling, however, will affect coverage and
fundraising, and in turn fundraising totals for the first quarter,
ending March 31, will drive coverage and polling.

While terms such as a 'natural' and 'clean label' may not have a
regulated definition attached to them, these particular descriptors do
motivate over half of US shoppers to purchase a product, a new survey of
1,000 adults conducted by Wakefield Research for Label Insight found.

Despite the lack standard definition, the term "natural" for many
consumer has come to mean the absence of artificial flavors, artificial
sweeteners, artificial preservatives, and color additives in
minimally-processed products. According to Label
Insight[https://www.labelinsight.com/] 's database, there are 21,838
food and beverage products containing the phrase "all natural" marketing
claim on package.

YESTERDAY, rushed out of my mind as usual and in between two school
runs, already late for work, I passed an elderly gentleman who often
takes a morning walk down my street.

He was leaning against a lamp post doing some gentle leg stretching
exercises and tried to stop me for a chat.

From The Bold Type to Good Trouble to Shadowhunters to grown-ish,
Freeform prides themselves with their slate of shows that put inclusion
and representation of marginalized communities on full display — and the
Freeform Summit unapologetically celebrated that on Wednesday night with
a series of panels that not only showcased their series but the social
issues in the real world that they reflect.

With so much talk about diversity, inclusion, and representation in
Hollywood, it seems that there’s a lot of lip service but not many TV
studios aren’t taking much action, and if they do, it’s not fully
realized and lacks authenticity. Geared towards millennial audiences —
or people who just seek change in the world — Freeform makes diversity,
inclusion and representation more than just buzzwords. It puts its money
where its mouth is.

On May 25, 1986, something happened in the United States that -- in this
divisive American moment -- sounds utterly bonkers.

It was a Sunday, around 3 p.m. on the East Coast, when millions of
people held hands with strangers for 15 minutes in a human chain that
was meant to stretch from New York to California. It was an effort to
raise money for organizations fighting hunger and homelessness, and it
was called Hands Across America. A Washington Post headline later
suggested that it ''might have been the most Eighties thing to happen in
the 1980s.''

WASHINGTON – Employers have spent a lot of time focusing on the
workforce’s youngest employees: millennials and the new Generation Z.
They’ve also spent a lot of time focusing on baby boomers, especially
when it comes to helping them plan for retirement.

But there’s one generation of workers employers haven’t engaged enough —
and it’s a group that is in need of some serious financial help: *Gen X*.

It is one of the great perils of the Information Age. You set out to
enjoy a few beers and wake up the next morning with a banging headache
and an email confirming your purchase of a life-size Kim Jong-un.

A survey from technology and business newsletter The Hustle found that
respondents had spent an average of about £335 a year online while
drunk. Purchases that may have been repented at leisure ranged from a
cutout of the North Korean dictator to a 30lb bag of Idaho potatoes.

With voting day for the 2019 general elections only three weeks away,
the presidential candidates have started to ramp up their campaign
efforts, targeting young voters who they hope will show up to the
polling stations on April 17.

Making up nearly half of the electorate, millennial voters have been
prioritized by the Joko "Jokowi" Widodo-Ma'ruf Amin and Prabowo
Subianto-Sandiaga Uno campaign teams since the early campaign days.

Getting There

The state's transportation system is one of the more complex networks to
fathom. Highly engineered roadways must interact with intricately
scheduled transit systems, which must connect with a vast plexus of
walkways and bikeways, all of which have to work 24 hours a day, every
day of the year.

While Indian fintechs are known to be complementary to the BFSI segment,
there are matured ones, which have assumed the role of full-service
providers. Highlights of the activities of 4 fintechs which have made a
mark in the ecosystem:

Indian fintechs are transforming from their startup stage to competing
with incumbents, especially in the financial services sector, even while
they seem to be complementing the hopes and aspirations of the
established entities. The financial services ecosystem as it exists
today is that while fintechs need not just capital but customers as
well, the established players lack an environment of innovation and they
seem to stagnate to a certain extent. It is in this background that the
two entities can complement each other.

measures, the biggest debt load of any province. It adds up to a
precarious fiscal situation, with implications for the entire country

When you go looking for evidence that Newfoundland and Labrador’s
economic dream is alive, you won’t find it in the tourism bureau images
of sleepy fishing villages and freshly laundered sheets waving on a line
in impossibly green fields. It’s not in Bull Arm, the offshore oil
platform construction site that has sat largely empty for most of the
past year and a half. You’ll find it in 2,400 acres of rock, trees and
nascent suburban ambition on the southwestern fringe of St. John’s,
known as Galway.

San Francisco, March 24 (CNA) An American reality show celebrity
promoted tourism in Taiwan and talked about his travel experience in the
country at the annual SF/Bay Area Travel & Adventure Show (TAS) Sunday.

Adam Klein, winner of Columbia Broadcasting System's (CBS) adventure
reality game show "Survivor: Millennials vs. *Gen X*" in 2016, discussed
his five-day trip to Taiwan under a deal signed by CBS and Taiwan's
Tourism Bureau in late 2017.

They arrive anxious for an answer. Or maybe, finally, a sense of peace.
They arrive because they haven't been able to resolve the biggest
question of their lives: Do I want to be a parent? And so they come to
the California therapy practice of Ann Davidman - by plane, by car, by
phone - in the hope that the self-titled "motherhood clarity mentor"
might deliver an epiphany.

Next comes a simple instruction: Write down every fear, every loaded
question, every disapproving comment and every panic-inducing headline
that has coalesced into a stranglehold of indecision.

New research this month has found that businesses are investing their
marketing dollars in the wrong places.

The latest annual marketing report from Salmat, a marketing company
which specialises in letterbox and online catalogues, shows declining
reliance on family and less influence from influencers than most
marketing budgets' priorities would imply.

Marketers and merchants have considered young consumers to be the “holy
grail” for generations.

But that approach needs to change. While consumers under 35 are
predicted to generate 18 percent of spending in the U.S. by 2020, buyers
over 50 will contribute 51 percent according to
Visa[https://usa.visa.com/content/dam/VCOM/regional/na/us/partner-with-us/documents/2018-holiday-preview.pdf].

THE emergence of new technology brought by the Fourth Industrial
Revolution (FIRe) can be a powerful tool to boost the tourism in Bohol,
a top official of the Bohol Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BCCI) said.

Marietta Gasatan, BCCI vice president for external affairs, said in a
forum organized by state think tank Philippine Institute of Development
Studies (PIDS), that the digital age had provided huge opportunities for
those in the tourism business to expand their markets, enhance customer
satisfaction and improve services.

Early indications are that many of the rising generation — Generation Z
— are reacting to some of their *Generation X* and millennial parents’
seemingly unmoored lives by anchoring themselves back to traditional
family and organized religion.

Undeniably, the ubiquitous baby boomer generation defiantly reordered
American society through their self-willed revolutions over sex, drugs,
divorce, abortion, race and feminism, among others. While a couple of
these revolutions perhaps were overdue and important to the welfare of
the American society, others have been very destructive. The boomers’
passionate pursuit of anti-establishment protests and lifestyles
extensively transformed the culture and its important underpinning
institutions, including the government, education, religion and, most
significantly, the family.

"Big Bang Theory" star Mayim Bialik thought she was helping Millennials
when she offered tips on how to avoid burnout, but the target audience
instead found it offered more condescension than useful advice.

In a video posted to her YouTube channel Thursday, Bialik, 43, offers a
series of ideas she thought would benefit Millennials (people aged from
23 to 38, according to Pew Research). She advised them to "slow your
roll," "lower your expectations," and "buckle down. "

If a presidential candidate is the sum of his or her experiences,
identity, policies and track record, then Beto O'Rourke looks like a
pretty regular middle-aged white guy with slightly left-of-center
policies, a respectable amount of experience in office, a nice (but not
too nice) house, a lovely family and a photogenic dog. But so far, the
early drafts of Brand Beto are less about who O'Rourke is now than how
he was formed by his youthful interests and experiences. And those all
tell one story: Beto O'Rourke is a very familiar kind of *Generation X*
white dude.

Kshipra Ajrekar probes why India's millennials want meaningful purpose

Millennials, typecast for popularising the 'selfie' and transforming the
meaning of the word 'viral', are bringing about a historic shift in the
reason behind choosing one's career: seeking a meaningful purpose.

No matter whether a person buys a Fratelli Beretta USA Inc. salami or a
product from its parent company in Italy, they can count on consistency.
"We guarantee to the consumer that the flavor profile and the experience
will be the same if you buy in the United States or go on vacation in
Italy," Simone Bocchini says.

Bocchini is the president of Beretta USA, the U.S.-based operation of
Fratelli Beretta, a provider of salami and other specialty meats. The
company's history stretches back to 181a, when Carlo Antonio Beretta
received ownership of his family business from his father in Barzano, Italy.

Food news stories dominated headlines in 2018, but which ones cut
through the clutter? In order to gather insight into which stories make
the greatest impact, Hunter Public Relations commissions an annual Food
News Study. In 2018, environmental advocacy broke through as the most
memorable story of the year, with news of Plastic Straw Bans ranking as
2018's No. 1 food news story.

In summer 2018, a powerful video of marine biologists removing a plastic
straw stuck in a sea turtle's nose grabbed national attention and
galvanized a movement to ban plastic straws. After the video went viral,
coffee mega retailer Starbucks announced that it would begin to phase
out single-use straws, and California banned full-service restaurants
from offering plastic straws, unless customers specifically request
them. These major moves ignited a firestorm of consumer conversation and
media coverage.

Caught between ageing parents and adult children, the going can be tough
for the sandwich generation, writes Joanna Davy

The sixth edition of the Australian Oxford Dictionary, released in 2017,
included more than 2000 new words to reflect the evolution of the
English language in the nation. Alongside millennial newcomers such as
“Insta” and “whatevs” was the “sandwich generation”, a term used to
describe the group of people caught between the responsibilities of
caring for ageing parents and adult children.

Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc has urged domestic auto manufacturers
and relevant authorities to make more efforts to boost the development
of the local auto sector, especially supporting industries.

Phuc said at a meeting last week that the Government has set up
strategies to develop the local auto sector, encouraging domestic firms
to manufacture autos at home rather than depending on imports. Local
firms should invest more in auto supporting industries to increase the
added values of automotive engines and accessories.

"Big Bang Theory" star Mayim Bialik thought she was helping Millennials
when she offered tips on how to avoid burnout but the target audience
instead found it offered more condescension than useful advice.

In a video posted to her YouTube channel Thursday, Bialik, 43, offers a
series of ideas she thought would benefit Millennials (people aged from
23 to 38 according to Pew Research). She advised them to "slow your
roll," "lower your expectations," and "buckle down. "

No matter whether a person buys a Fratelli Beretta USA Inc. salami or a
product from its parent company in Italy, they can count on consistency,
"We guarantee to the consumer that the flavor profile and the experience
will be the same if you buy in the United States or go on vacation in
Italy," Simone Bocchini says.

Bocchini is the president of Beretta USA, the U.S.-based operation of
Fratelli Beretta, a provider of salami and other specialty meats. The
company's history stretches back to 1812, when Carlo Antonio Beretta
received ownership of his family business from his father in Barzano, Italy.

They arrive anxious for an answer. Or maybe, finally, a sense of peace.
They arrive because they haven't been able to resolve the biggest
question of their lives: Do I want to be a parent? And so they come to
the California therapy practice of Ann Davidman - by plane, by car, by
phone - in the hope that the self-titled "motherhood clarity mentor"
might deliver an epiphany.

Next comes a simple instruction: Write down every fear, every loaded
question, every disapproving comment and every panic-inducing headline
that has coalesced into a stranglehold of indecision.

A new survey of 1,000 consumers reveals the line between effective
personalized marketing and creepy invasiveness.

According to “Privacy & Personalization,” a study from multichannel
behavioral marketing platform SmarterHQ, 74% of respondents say mobile
push notifications are the most invasive channel because they view their
phone as an everyday tool that’s part of their personal space. Other
leading creepy personalization tactics include website chat popups that
use artificial intelligence (AI) to communicate, as well as
advertisements featuring products or brands a consumer has looked at
online or on their phone.

2019 MAR 2 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at
Leisure & Travel Week -- Investigators discuss new findings in
Hospitality Management. According to news reporting from Hat Yai,
Thailand, by VerticalNews journalists, research stated, "This study
examines how corporate social responsibility (CSR) participation affects
organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) through meaningful work. This
work is significant for three reasons: the joint examination of CSR,
meaningful work, and OCB is novel; the comparative effects of CSR
perception versus CSR participation have not been examined previously;
and this is the first examination of such relationships for different
generations of employees."

Financial supporters for this research include Thailand Research Fund
(TRF), Prince of Songkla University (PSU) through the Research Grant for
New Scholars.

Editor's note: Juan Mayorga is a journalist specializing in
environmental issues, mainly climate change, energy transition and
sustainable urban development. He is a Master in Public Management and
GeoGovernance by the University of Potsdam, Germany, a collaborator of
national and international media. The opinions expressed in this column
are exclusive of its author. (Expansion) - "I want them to panic, to
feel the fear that I feel every day ... and then I want them to act as
if the house is on fire, because it is": Greta Thunberg. More than a
million and a half people in more than 2,000 locations in 125 countries
left something very clear on March 15: A new generation is tired of the
inability of its predecessors to face climate change, a whopping affair
that represents nothing less than the greatest challenge that humanity
has ever faced and that threatens, literally, the possibility of these
young people to be, to remain.

Bernie Torme’s subtlety and dexterity drew many admirers as well as work
with the likes of Ozzy Osbourne and Gillan

Bernie Torme, who has died in London aged 66, may well be regarded as
the last of the great British and Irish guitar heroes who once ruled
rock music. Torme never achieved the fame that garlanded the likes of
Jeff Beck and Rory Gallagher – two guitarists whose playing influenced
him – but his blues-flavoured solos and friendly, unpretentious manner
made him the go-to player for many a heavy-rock star. Ozzy Osbourne, Ian
Gillan and Dee Snyder all employed Torme.
