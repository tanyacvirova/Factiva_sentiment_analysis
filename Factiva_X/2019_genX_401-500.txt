Recent studies show consumers aged 50+ are a $7.6 trillion economic force, from banking to technology to retail. Loss prevention specialist Chargebacks911 alerts merchants that older consumers can contribute greater value than millennials. 
 

TAMPA, Fla., Feb. 19, 2019 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Americans aged 50 and
older account for 51 cents of every dollar spent in the United States
and generate $7.6 trillion in annual economic activity, which makes this
demographic equivalent to the world's third-largest economy.(1) And with
the 50-plus population projected to grow from 115 million in 2018 to 132
million by 2030,(2) their financial clout will likely continue to grow.
While many brands have made millennials their top target,
Chargebacks911--a leading dispute mitigation and loss prevention
firm--advises merchants not to overlook older consumers, whose
purchasing power offers a path to sustainable profitability.

LONDON—Japanese car maker Honda Motor Co. will shut a major production
plant in the U.K., becoming the latest auto group to plan a pull back
from the U.K. as Brexit looms.

The closure of the plant in Swindon, a pro-Brexit district in southwest
England, was confirmed by local British lawmaker Justin Tomlinson and
fills out a picture suggesting that the nation's car-manufacturing
industry is in decline.

In the cult 1999 film about corporate malaise, the story of an everyman
rallying against his sedate life found itself a loyal following

Maybe it was Y2K anxiety. Maybe something was in the Hollywood water.
Whatever the reason, 1999 yielded a bumper crop of movies about angry,
ordinary men throwing off society’s shackles and finding something
extraordinary in themselves.

Paul Frantz, industry director at Google, shares things app marketers
can learn from trends

I’VE SPENT much of the last seven years helping companies adapt to
demographic shifts as baby boomers began retiring and *Gen X* and
millennials became the primary focus of marketers. But in demography, as
in marketing, change is the only constant. And today a new generation —
86 million strong and with money to spend — is beginning to enter the
workforce.

Last Thursday marked the first anniversary of the massacre at Marjory
Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., the shooting that took
17 lives. Over the past year, 1,200 children 18 or younger have died as
a result of gun violence in the United States, according to a report
released this week by the Trace.

Among the dead: Christian Robinson, 14, "who tried to make people laugh
every day," Carolina Monsanto, 16, "who had dreams of becoming a nurse,"
and Cody Worden, 13, "a wrestler, a football player and Little Leaguer."

NEW YORK -- Shoppers are getting smarter and more health conscious these
days, especially when it comes to snacks.

According to a report from NPD Group Inc., consumers are eyeing snacks
that have perceived health benefits, whether they are salty, sweet,
high-calorie or low-calorie snacks. The most common requests are
protein, natural and no sugar snacks. The youngest generations are
leading the pack in hunting for healthy snacks. Generation Z,
Millennials and *Generation X* are all actively looking for healthy
alternatives and expressing positive attitudes in snacking and eating
healthier. Meanwhile, older generations are looking for food that is low
in sodium and sugar content to be able to deal with medical conditions.

It's 2019, and blackface is big news. Again. While people weren't
exactly shocked that now-lawmakers from Virginia were racist in the
1980s, present-day marketers seem to be trying to outdo one another.
Blatantly offensive caricatures are popping up nearly every day: Prada
recently pulled golliwog-looking charms from the shelves, and Gucci and
Katy Perry have apologized for clothing and shoe designs that seem like
they were inspired by minstrel shows (see Brand Playbook, p. 20).

But questions about what exactly constitutes blackface and how much
intention matters miss the point: Kendall Jenner didn't put shoe polish
on her face in that disastrous 2017 Pepsi ad, but cultural appropriation
is and has always been a mainstay of a society (and an industry) awash
in structural racism. Maybe we shouldn't be surprised this is happening
now. Happy Black History Month.

The spending on B2B e-commerce platform technologies, systems and
services is growing at a faster pace. Gartner estimates that 75% of B2B
procurement spending will take place via an online marketplace within
the next five years. The key trend that is likely to further accelerate
B2B ecommerce technology spend is the demand for better buying

Happy 25th anniversary to Reality Bites, the movie that not only defined
*Generation X* but made it cool to make out to “Baby, I Love Your Way”
while slurping a Big Gulp. Ben Stiller’s directorial debut encapsulated
what it was like to be a twenty-something in 1994, from Gap promotions
and toilet-paper coffee filters to AIDS scares and coming out to your
family.

One of the most memorable scenes in the film is when the gang gets
stoned and Lelaina (Winona Ryder) suggests they purchase food with her
father’s gas card. They proceed to stock up on Pringles, Minute Maid and
other munchie snacks.

Mid-cap stocks aren't as prolific as the market's best-known companies,
nor as exciting as nimble newcomers. Rather, mid-caps - typically
between $2 billion and $10 billion in market capitalization - are
nestled between large and small caps, quietly doing their own thing.

But there's still much to be said for them.

There are three types of individuals in today's workforce. First came
the baby boomers. Born between 1946 and 1964, most of them have, today,
reached their retirement age, while others are heading towards it.

The second group has the *Gen X*, sandwiched between the baby boomers
and the millennials. While there isn't a specific birth date of birth
for this class of individuals, most of them were born from the
early-to-mid 1960s to the early 1980s.

The 23-year-old native of Erwin, Tennessee, has watched the show since
its first season and began sending in audition tapes at 18, the minimum
age for "Survivor" castaways.

If none of us watching could quite believe we were in the presence of
greatness, vocalist Glenn Gregory was on hand to vocalise our joy at
this turn of events. "Just to let you know, he was in the Spider from
Mars," he gasped, pointing back over his shoulder at David Bowie's
stalwart drummer from the early 70s Mick Woody' Woodmansey.

Presidential election | The radical Green New Deal proposals show why
the Democrats urgently need some adults in the room if they hope to beat
Trump in 2020, writes AFR correspondent Jacob Greber in Washington.

The Green New Deal hatched by the Democratic Party's fast rising but
inexperienced progressive wing is exactly what Donald Trump has been
waiting for.

This was the designer’s second outing in London — the new location suits
her very well

The night before Victoria Beckham’s excellent AW19 show I went to a
dinner where I sat next to a professional executive and former chief
executive who didn’t work in fashion. She was bemoaning the current
fashion landscape, and the lack of things to wear. She liked to wear
dresses and skirts, she told me; she liked tailoring. She wanted her
look to be interesting rather than anonymous and anodyne. She was happy
to take risks, but she wasn’t prepared to dress like a clown.

While millennials garner much of the negative press around financial
issues -- they live with their parents because they can't get jobs! They
spend all their money on avocado toast! -- Gen Xers may be the ones who
are really in trouble.

school supplies is becoming increasingly unavoidable. Procedure that
although it is still performed mostly in the physical store little by
little begins to move to the online channel.

According to data collected by Kawésqar Lab, during 2018, 15% of those
who used the e-commerce channel in the Metropolitan Region, during the
period March-May, acquired at least one product of the category (see

Former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld on Sunday defended his decision
to pursue a 2020 Republican primary challenge against President Trump,
saying in an interview on ABC News's "This Week" that he is acting in
the best interests of the country.

"I think the Republicans in Washington want to have no election,
basically. I don't think that would be very good for the country," Weld
told host Martha Raddatz.

Last seen performing in a see-through, cylindrical "time capsule" awash
with projected images, Rick Miller astonished Segal audiences with Boom,
a multimedia solo show that had Miller giving voice to more than 100
famous figures, including pop and rock stars.

It took us from the atom bombs that ended the Second World War to the
Apollo 11 ignition that took man to the moon. That titular 1969 boom
also, according to Miller, had an aphrodisiac effect on countless
millions, including his parents: Miller was born in 1970, which is more
or less where Boom X, which plays at the Segal Centre through March 10,
picks up the story.

Gen. Z is a generation that values interpersonal activities, and values
relationships with people more than relationships with material things.

In many social groups in Israel and around the world, status symbols are
usually material things. This refers to valuable purchases, whether they
are watches, luxury cars, cell phones, luxury clothing brands, places of
residence or diamond jewelry. The more prestigious items a person has,
the higher his status will be.

and what that term lacks in clarity it also lacks in pronouncability. So
I prefer something less snappy but more descriptive: too young to
remember John Lennon’s death, but old enough to remember
Tiffany[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6Q3mHyzn78].

NEW YORK - The Park Avenue Armory went pitch black Wednesday night at
precisely 6 o'clock. The first model appeared in the spotlight -
standing dramatically alone. She was buttoned into a leopard-print cape
that billowed out from her shoulders, softly but grandly. The ruffled
collar of her blouse rose up around her neck, and her slim trousers were
cropped at the ankle.

Another model followed and then another. They wore other versions of
this spacious silhouette - an A-shape that appeared in different forms
around the body: a skirt, a coat, a minidress, a feather-trimmed gown, a
little knit hat topped with a feather. Jacobs's show was the finale of
the fall 2019 runway season here. And it was a poetic and beautiful finish.

'This generation is the first in living memory that will be worse off
than their parents." Across the western world, this line has become a
trope capturing all the woes of the neoliberal, globalised market
system, as some love to call it.

It is arguably the biggest theme in politics in Europe and the US today.
Donald Trump would not have become president if voters had not believed
that the steady generational progress since the Second World War had
ground to a halt. A nostalgia for the days of empire is often cited as
the driving force behind Brexit. In reality it was more about
working-class and, to a lesser extent, middle-class people unhappy with
their lot, feeling that their income levels had stagnated.

Upgrading skills is a key goal for workers in 2019, Melanie Burgess finds

WORKERS are taking control of their future employability, with two in
three planning to upskill or re-skill this year. SEEK research finds the
decision to improve skills to better perform in their current job or
gain new skills for a completely new job is on the agenda for 63 per
cent of Aussies.

Heatwaves are occurring across the country, but just because it’s

Are senior homeowners preventing millennials from buying houses? Could
the decisions of millions of older owners to “age in place” rather than
sell their homes explain why millennials are lagging behind in

Cast members of MBN's reality show "The Five Actors" gesture during a
news conference to preview the show at the Imperial Palace Hotel in
southern Seoul. Courtesy of MBNVeteran actors explore hit trendsBy Kang
Aa-youngIt's not easy for a reality show to combine comedy and
heart-warming elements. But this is not so for MBN's new reality show
“The Five Actors.” The show proves that fun and emotion can go together.
The show started off with an impressive 3.5 percent of viewership,
according to Nielsen Korea, as its first episode aired on Thursday
night.This is not a surprise considering that even prior to the
premiere; the show had drawn much attention mainly because of the cast
members. Some of them are highly sought-after actors.

Millennials are postal illiterates.

They're so befuddled by the process of mailing an envelope that they
don't even know where to put the stamp and the address, according to
Canada's North Delta Reporter.

2019 FEB 23 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at
Investment Weekly News -- While 2019 got off to a rocky start, with a
partial government shutdown and trade challenges attributed to tariffs,
consumers at the close of 2018 were buoyed by their strong household
financial health and were spending accordingly. The latest IRI Consumer
Connect survey results find that nearly 55 percent of consumers report
their households were in good financial shape in Q4 2018, up 4 percent
from Q3 2018 and 2 percent from Q4 2017. Hand-in-hand with consumer
confidence is the growing and evolving e-commerce channel. In fact,
2018's e-commerce sales increased by a whopping 35.4 percent, according
to IRI's new research, Consumer Confidence Reflected in E-Commerce Growth.

WASHINGTON — Are senior homeowners preventing millennials from buying
houses? Could the decisions of millions of older owners to “age in
place” rather than sell their homes explain why millennials are lagging
behind in homeownership?

A provocative new study
(tinyurl.com/y3why5mh[http://tinyurl.com/y3why5mh]) from federally
chartered mortgage investor Freddie Mac suggests the answer may be yes.
“Who is living in those homes that millennials might otherwise have
bought?” ask the study’s authors. Their answer: baby boomers, war babies
and people born in the 1930s.

HOLY HOLY AT THE TYNE THEATRE, NEWCASTLE, ON FEBRUARY 12 With the death
of David Bowie in 2016, we lost one of the all-time great performers. A
musical visionary who broke down the boundaries of creativity to produce
some of the most iconic sounds and visions of a generation.

Bowie may be gone but he's certainly not forgotten as his musical legacy
lives on. And judging by the crowd at the Tyne Theatre in Newcastle,
there's still a big demand to see his music performed live.

NEVER SAY NEVER NEVERMIND was *Generation X*’s White Album, Exile on
Main Street and Never Mind The Bollocks rolled into one, a sonic blast
that erased all before it.

It’s easy now, almost 30 years on, to underestimate its influence but
it’s not exaggerating to state that this collection of 12 songs changed
the direction of popular music.

"Luck on every finger."

It's the inscription written below the center image of Pavement's
classic second album Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain, released 25 years ago
this Valentine's Day. The phrase flanks an image of a woman's hands
adorned in turquoise rings and clutching a betting card for horseracing,
a euphemism for the big leap into the major leagues with an album
light-years ahead of its predecessor Slanted & Enchanted in terms of
scope, sound and substance.

IRVINE, Calif. - KTGY Architecture + Planning has named Ben Kasdan, AIA,
LEED AP, NCARB to the position of associate principal. In this new role
leading the high-density design studio on the East Coast, Kasdan will
relocate to KTGY’s Tysons, Virginia office, from the firm’s Irvine,
California office, where he has held positions of increasing
responsibility since 2003. Kasdan, who has worked in collaboration with
the Tysons office on multiple projects during the past several years,
will be splitting his time between the two coasts until his move to the
Washington, D.C. area this summer.

Craig Jackson recognizes Canadians at a glance at his Barrett-Jackson
classic car auction in Scottsdale, Ariz.

“You can always spot them – they’re the ones in shorts on days when
everybody else is wearing jackets,” jokes Jackson, who is opening the
Canadian International AutoShow in Toronto on Thursday as guest speaker
at the annual media conference.

How can brands still be getting it so wrong? In an age where the
most-desired market segments — Millennials, *Gen X* and older Gen Z
consumers — are driven by values, and especially diversity and
inclusion and the positions that brands take, the fact that brands still
release racist products and ads is mind-boggling.

Nowhere is this more evident than in the fashion industry. Just last
week Gucci and Adidas joined the ranks of H&M, Dolce & Gabbana, Prada
and others in releasing products and ads that convey racist messages,
whether intentional or not — presumably not. Gucci’s balaclava-style
sweater evoking blackface imagery and Adidas’ all-white shoe in a line
meant to celebrate Black History Month is not just embarrassing to the
companies but potentially damaging to their reputation and internal morale.

Millennials and Gen Z really are different than older generations,
according to a new survey from Epsilon.

The survey, “Age matters: A guide to cross-generation marketing,” found
a noticeable change in spending and brand interactions among Millennial
and Gen Z consumers, who generally prefer self-serve options and
services that put consumers in control.

Thursday marks the first anniversary of the massacre at Marjory Stoneman
Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., the shooting that took 17 lives.
Over the past year, 1,200 children 18 or younger have died as a result
of gun violence in the United States, according to a report released
this week by the Trace. Among the dead: Christian Robinson, 14, "who
tried to make people laugh every day," Carolina Monsanto, 16, "who had
dreams of becoming a nurse," and Cody Worden, 13, "a wrestler, a
football player and Little Leaguer."

In 1774, Europe was infected with what was known as Werther Fever.
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe had published his novel "The Sorrows of Young
Werther," about a young man hopelessly in love with a woman engaged to
another man. So intense is his suffering at being apart from her that he
kills himself.

The book was an overnight sensation among young people gripped by the
hyper-romantic "Sturm und Drang" period in German culture. "The Sorrows
of Young Werther" became an international bestseller, and bootleg copies
began to circulate. Young men began to dress like Werther. Most
alarming, the novel was said to have stimulated copycat suicides among
brokenhearted lovers. The authorities in several cities and countries
responded by banning the book. In Leipzig, it was even illegal to wear
Werther's costume of a blue tailcoat, yellow waistcoat, trousers and
tall boots.

The conversation around Social Security sometimes seems to take place in
two separate worlds. On one side, there are people who believe that, as
the share of the population that is older than 65 continues to grow, the
program is unsustainable in its current form. On the other side are
people who point out that not only is Social Security not particularly
generous (it replaces only about 40 percent of pre-retirement income),
but also we need to alter both its funding and its payouts to account
for higher inequality, which simultaneously increases people's
dependence on the program even as it further undermines the program's
finances.

One man firmly in the latter camp is Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who
reintroduced his Social Security Expansion Act on Wednesday. The day
selected is no accident: Wednesday also marks something Social Security
activists call Scrap the Cap Day, an annual event designed to highlight
how little millionaires pay into the system.

Homeowners looking to add personality and individuality to their home
are more likely to undertake a do it yourself remodel than hire a
professional, according to the National Association of Realtors'2019
Remodeling Impact Report: DIY. The report also shows that cash-strapped
millennials are the most likely of any generation to take on a DIY project.

The report examines the differences between remodeling when hiring a
professional compared to homeowners who pursue "do it yourself"
projects. The report also differentiates between projects that were
undertaken to benefit the homes of consumers and those that benefit
consumers' pets.

New York's Museum of Modern Art closes for renovations in June. When the
museum reopens on Oct. 21, it will have 30% more gallery space. The
price tag for the expansion is $450 million, more than $200 million of
which comes from the estate of David Rockefeller, MoMA's most openhanded
donor, who died in 2017 at age 101. To be sure, $200 million is chump
change in the fantasy land of pop culture. (It cost $316 million to make
"Avengers: Infinity War.") But when it comes to the fine arts, that's
very serious money—the biggest single donation that MoMA has ever received.

Like any fan of nostalgic TV can attest, the middle child often feels
neglected (“The Brady Bunch,” anyone?) Whether middle-child syndrome is
sound science or pop psychology, clients of a certain age can still feel
the way young Jan Brady did in the early 1970s — held captive between
older and younger generations.

Dubbed the sandwich generation, clients between 40 and 50 years of age
can be pressured from two sides with financial and emotional burdens
that involve caring for older, possibly ill, parents while also
supporting their children, whether they are grown or not.

Young families in Canada's big cities believe houses and condos will be
a good investment over the next five years, and they are sacrificing
their privacy, time and small pleasures to buy them, according to a
report by Sotheby's International Realty Canada.

The study is based on a survey of 1,743 families headed by adults aged
20 to 45. It found that millennials and generation Xers are delaying
both retirement savings and paying off credit card and student debt in
order to afford homes, with 78 per cent expecting homes to match or
outperform other financial investments over the next five years. In
Toronto, that number rises to 83 per cent.

True or not, one of the impressions I have of my grandmother's era is
that life was simpler then. It was less genetically modified, and more
wholesome. It was homemade bread and butter, and meat and potatoes, but
people were healthier because they didn't have computers and smartphones
zapping their lives - that's my inkling. My perception is the less
genetically modified foods they ate were better than the corn syrup and
diet sodas of our day, and my grandmother's group didn't have the health
problems we now face. For some reason, that's the perception I have,
notwithstanding the fact that my grandmother died from complications
with cancer before I was born. Somehow, the idea that everything was
farm-to-table - and better - in my grandmother's day still hovers, even
though her own cookbook calls for gelatin and lard and tins of Spam for
a regular Sunday meal.

Jo Kelly, Events Operation Director for CR Worldwide, explains why
incentive trips must include plenty of incredible experiences that can
be shared

Social media has played a key role in an attendee's experience of
incentive travel for years, from tagging the destinations they visit on
Facebook to tweeting trip updates on Twitter and, more recently, posting
and sharing trip photos on Instagram. Meanwhile, offering an
unforgettable experience, which makes attendees feel valued and
motivated, has become a key aim for agencies and event planners when
providing incentive travel.

You have until March 1 to put money into a registered retirement savings
plan and get a refund on your 2018 income taxes.

I'm a believer. After opening an RRSP in my 20s, I made regular
contributions and learned how to invest in the stock market with a
financial adviser at one of Canada's bank-owned brokerages.

Original, But Creates Its Own Identity

BET’s ‘Boomerang’, premieres on Feb. 12! The new comedy series is a
continuation of the 1992 romcom of the same name! But, the cast tells
HollywoodLife how the series separates itself from the film — and, how
it has a ‘Friends’ element to it!

Boomerang will bring a fresh take on the 1992 Eddie Murphy romantic
comedy of the same name to BET on February 12 at 10/9c. — We say this
because the show’s witty and warm cast, made up of Lala Milan (Tia
Reed), RJ Walker (David Wright), Leland Martin (Ari Thomas), Tetona
Jackson (Simone Graham),Tequan Richmond (Bryson Broyer) and Brittany
Inge (Crystal Garrett), exudes good energy as a unit, which is why it
was understandable that they compared the reboot to Friends. The cast
stopped by HollywoodLife’s New York offices on February 6, ahead of
Boomerang’s Tuesday premiere.

THE Karebosi stadium in Makassar united Sandiaga Salahuddin Uno and the
Sabyan Gambus group on one stage for the first time on Saturday three
weeks ago. In front of thousands of people attending the ‘Grand
Get-Together with a Million Stars’ event, the running mate of
presidential candidate Prabowo Subianto praised the group’s lead
vocalist Khoirunnisa.

Sandiaga said he was touched by Khoirunnisa’s songs, such as Deen
Assalam, which has over 200 million YouTube views. “This goes across
ethnicity, people and religions. I am moved to hear the lyrics in
Sabyan’s beautiful voice,” Sandiaga said.

*Generation X* and Y parents cop it, possibly with some justification,
for being terribly guilty of "helicoptering","snowploughing", and
lately, even "lawnmowing" the ground before the feet of our darling
children. The first, as we know, involves hovering too closely, the
second is blasting obstacles out of the way, and the third is ensuring
even the smallest bump is ironed out for kids. We're told we involve
ourselves too much, we try to over-engineer things, we worry too much.

We're accused of making life hard for our kids and for teachers (OK,
that bit is true) by not being able to stand back and let life simply
unfold for kids as it did for us - possibly the last generations who
could go off on our bikes without telling our mum the GPS location of
our destination, or her having the ability to "find my phone" it herself.
