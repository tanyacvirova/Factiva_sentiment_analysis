Not long ago, it was the norm for individuals to work for a single
employer across their entire career, enjoying all the benefits
associated with long-term employment status. Times are changing rapidly,
however, with temporary, fixed-term, and freelance working relationships
becoming the new norm, especially for younger generations. Some have
labelled these developments as a transition towards the "Uber" or "gig"
economy.

In 1999, Boomers made up over half (51.4%) of the workforce. By
comparison, *Gen-X* made up 41.3% and Millennials made up 7.2%. Contrast
that with statistics for 2014: Boomers made up 31.1%, with *Gen-X*
making up 33.9% and Millennials making up 36.8%. [1]

The debate is hotting up and so is the drumming of tables in college
canteen discussions and late-night hostel conversations. Deliberations
revolve around hot-button topics, from India-Pakistan to GST, mandir to
black money, and development to inflation. But for young voters, the
demands are basic: "Give us jobs and end corruption."Nineteen-year-old
Kavin Parmar, a Nerul resident studying in Pune, got his doctor father
to help him register on the electoral rolls so that "he can make a
point". The teenager says the most important issue for him is corruption
and he wants to ensure his "vote, even if NOTA, brings about a change
and that India is rid of corrupt elements"."I want to choose my
government. It is my responsibility to vote and I am looking forward to
getting inked the first time. You cannot sit at home and seek change.
Youngsters nowadays are very involved," says the medical student who is
witness to a Modi vs Rahul debate almost every night at his hostel.

One thing we learn in “Captain Marvel” is that it’s pronounced MarVELL,
like the English poet — or at least it used to be, on distant planets
and right here on Earth, a windy rock also known as C-53. That was back
in 1995, when most of this movie takes place and when the world as we
know it had not yet been colonized by the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Yes, of course, Marvel Comics had been around for decades, but when the
heroine crashes through the roof of the Blockbuster Video store, landing
in between the “Family” and “Drama” sections, there are no Avengers or
Iron-Man titles on the shelves.

FAST food addicts are visiting outlets as often as three times a week,
new research shows.

An Australian study of our eating preferences has found the number of
people repeatedly loading up on burgers, fries or other speedy meals has
grown. Research firm Roy Morgan said more than three million Aussies (15
per cent) now reported visiting quick service restaurants at least 10
times in an average four weeks. That was up from 2.5 million (13 per
cent) four years ago.

Celebrity deaths will always do a number on that day's internet, but
Luke Perry's death of a stroke last week at age 52, seemed to strum
something in a lot of women I know, mostly of the *Gen X* persuasion,
but also a few early millennials.

It turns out, according to my social-media feeds, that Dylan McKay, as
played by Perry on Beverly Hills, 90210, was everyone's first pretend
boyfriend. Dylan was a bad boy, with a reputation, a trust fund, and a
heart of gold; as per the demands of the nighttime soap, he bounced back
and forth between Brenda (Midwestern good-girl-goes-dramatic) and Kelly
(Californian beach babe who generates feminist frisson by choosing
herself over Dylan or Brandon). Luke Perry played Dylan bruised,
slouching, squinting, removed, a Baja-hoodied anti-hero: a perfect crush.

NO doubt, vinyl is back as a preferred medium for music fans all over

Now it begs the question: How does Original Pilipino Music-from the
albums recorded back in the 'Golden Age' of the 1960s to 1980s, all the
way up to today-fare in the market?

Surely the reason Rod Stewart keeps himself busy with covers of
sophisticated standards these days is because he just can't stomach the
idea of wriggling round a stage croaking Do Ya Think I'm Sexy? in his
seventies. Lionel Richie's still a fine figure of a man - although just
a few years Stewart's junior, he probably doesn't do much Dancing on the
Ceiling anymore. But the granddaddy of all the put-awaychildish-songs
must be The Who's My Generation, written by a 20-yearold Pete Townshend
when, somewhat surreally, the Queen Mother had his car, which happened
to be an old hearse, towed away after she was irked by it on her daily
drive through Belgravia and he had to pay £250 to get it back.

There's something pleasingly perverse about what was thought to be a
wail of existential anguish on behalf of a whole generation - "Hope I
die before I get old!" - turning out to be the niche peeve of a
privileged pop star.

We thought we’d put our heads down, do the work with no complaints, and
the work would speak for itself. What we didn’t fully appreciate is that
we, the “forgotten generation” — *Generation X* — were sandwiched
between two larger groups with better public relations, who knew how to
promote themselves and their accomplishments while we self-deprecated,
undersold, and undervalued ourselves into invisibility.

When I think about the greatest issues facing women of my age, I see
two: visibility and voice. We aren’t the youngest in the room, but we
aren’t the oldest. We are just as comfortable leveraging technology in
the workplace as we are with more conventional skills. We have plenty of
years of experience behind us and plenty more ahead, but we’ve allowed
ourselves to be erased — to be known as “America’s neglected middle
child.” According to a 2018 poll, we’re America’s most stressed working
professionals.

PEOPLE TALKING ARE

This week, in an unwanted flashback to the Starmageddon of 2016 when
celeb deaths were an almost daily occurrence, we lost three famous faces
from the 1990s. Luke Perry (52) was in many ways the face of the decade.
Perry shot to fame in the iconic TV show Beverly Hills 90210 (a cross
between the soaps that preceded it and the reality TV that came after).
The actor was often compared to James Dean for his looks and his bad boy
90210 character, Dylan McKay. On the flipside from 90210, the
distinctive-looking Prodigy frontman Keith Flint (49), who died on the
same day as Perry, was the personification of the rave scene. Perry and
Flint's deaths were closely followed by that of TV presenter and
chronicler of all things *Gen X*, Magenta Devine. Devine maintained her
1990s look of black bob, black sunglasses and red lipstick throughout
her career. People from the 1980s going was bad enough, but the 1990s?
It's too soon.

MILLENNIALS are leading the way on business and confidence performance,
new research shows.

A study of small and medium-sized business owners reveals 2018 was a
more successful year for those from Gen Z and Y than their older
counterparts in *Gen X* and Baby Boomers.

Time-poor New Zealanders are taking shorter and more frequent holidays —
a trend which research suggests is good for mental health.

A new study, commissioned by holiday rental company Bookabach, has found
the majority of surveyed New Zealanders felt pre-booking weekend
getaways provided a more positive outlook on daily life.

Why making things yourself is joyously cool again.

In the small Southern Tablelands town of Taralga, the 133rd Annual
Agricultural Show is on this weekend. You've left it a bit late now, but
with a little foresight you could have entered your jams and preserves,
your home brew, or even your "Fancy Work", a category that embraces
everything from best beanie to best cushion.

Series 2 update adds sparkle and class, writes Nathan Ponchard.

Suzuki helped create a whole new niche with the original Vitara in 1988.
Featuring trendy blistered mudguards, in-vogue styling, switchable
four-wheel drive and an open-air option, it moved *Generation X*
fashionistas as much as Johnny Depp did with his shirt unbuttoned.

DATING apps such as Tinder and Bumble have changed two generations of

We aim to become a one-stop-solution for shaving and grooming products
for men and women,” he told BW Businessworld in an interaction

Gone are the days of the grungy look for men. Today, men want to be on
top of their grooming game. Even the ladies like well-groomed men now,
don't they? However, finding the right products at affordable prices has
not been easy. It was this challenge that prompted Ambala-born and
US-educated Sidharth Shanker Oberoi to start LetsShave, a platform that
aggregates quality razors at affordable prices. “I hope to achieve $10
million in sales in the next three years and achieve over 1 million
customers. We aim to become a one-stop-solution for shaving and grooming
products for men and women,” he told BW Businessworld in an interaction.

Changing work dynamics, emerging global trade and industry demands have
drastically evolved the way workforce is managed across sectors.
Organizations of size across industries have employees of different age
groups and cultural background who are working together. Therefore,
managing a group of *Gen X* might be completely different from managing
a millennial or a Gen Z. As employees come with different skill sets,
experience and expectations, it becomes difficult for the management to
engage with all employees and assess their work with a common strategy
or technique. Additionally, there is a mix of workforce ranging from
permanent employees to contractual staff and consultants who work in
various capacities in many organizations. Therefore, managing and
overseeing such a diverse workforce has increasingly become difficult
without the intervention of technology.

Hawaiian Electric Industries’ announcement last month that two women
would be joining the company’s board of directors this year created the
potential to double the number of women on the board governing the
company that owns Hawaii’s largest utility and third-largest bank.

It’s unknown whether Celeste Connors, executive director of Hawaii Green
Growth, and Mary Powell, CEO of Green Mountain Power, will replace
current directors on the nine-member board or be elected to additional
seats; the company has not announced which members would retire from the
board this year.

Can't we all just get along? Probably not.

That's unfortunately true in the workplace, where generational divides
between co-workers can cause rifts in everything from how best to
integrate technology to what's acceptable conversation at the water cooler.

2019 MAR 2 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at
Leisure & Travel Week -- Investigators discuss new findings in
Hospitality Management. According to news reporting from Hat Yai,
Thailand, by VerticalNews journalists, research stated, "This study
examines how corporate social responsibility (CSR) participation affects
organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) through meaningful work. This
work is significant for three reasons: the joint examination of CSR,
meaningful work, and OCB is novel; the comparative effects of CSR
perception versus CSR participation have not been examined previously;
and this is the first examination of such relationships for different
generations of employees."

Financial supporters for this research include Thailand Research Fund
(TRF), Prince of Songkla University (PSU) through the Research Grant for
New Scholars.

It’s cultural change and overcoming society’s embedded ‘Matrix’ that
makes gender equality a tough nut to truly crack, say several of the
industry’s key marketing and media leaders.

Speaking on a panel organised by Zenith to mark this year’s global
International Women’s Day (IWD), Luxottica’s VP of marketing, Milena
Cavicchioli, Nine chief sales officer, Michael Stephenson, and SBS
director of marketing, Jane Palfreyman, shared how their respective
organisations are tackling the question of gender balance. They also
debated the many reasons why it’s still an issue without a clear resolution.

ZURICH, March 8 (Reuters) - The global art market experienced another
uptick in 2018, helped by an increase in the spending power of
millennials, a report published by UBS and Art Basel said on Friday.

A survey of wealthy individuals conducted by UBS and art economist Clare
McAndrew for the report found millennials were buying art more actively
and frequently taking to the internet to do so. It found that more of
them were willing to shell out big money on art than their older peers.

LNG storehouse, and gasification and gas transportation systems.

When it comes to sustainability and transparency, the fashion industry
has taken its share of hits.

While older generations may not have known about, or paid attention to,
issues like factory conditions, processing pollution, or the
decomposition time for synthetic fibers, younger generations are taking
note. Now, the conversations that were started by millennials are being
taken up and acted on by Gen Z.

*Generation X* wasn’t supposed to have icons. Of course, we wound up
with plenty of them anyway—Whitney Houston, Kurt Cobain, Tupac Shakur,
Heath Ledger. A humbler one showed up on our television screens in 1990
in the form of Luke Perry, who rolled into the cast of the teen drama
Beverly Hills, 90210 like a James Dean–haired thundercloud. With
smoldering looks and a poetic soul, Perry’s character, Dylan McKay,
became not only a sex symbol for Gen Xers, but also an early springboard
for a new role. As Fred Andrews—the father of Archie, the red-headed
protagonist of The CW’s far edgier teen drama Riverdale—Perry took his
heartthrob
status[https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/03/luke-perry-reluctant-heartthrob/584176/?utm_source=feed]
and, with quiet virtuosity, flipped the script, becoming the wizened
patriarch instead of the fatherless young rebel.

About 55 per cent of working women say they are being held back from
landing senior jobs by the need for more flexible working arrangements.

Yet only 33 per cent of working men agreed that this was an obstacle for
women, found an Australian survey coinciding with International Women's
Day (IWD) 2019 on Friday.

A middle-aged father and his adult daughter sit across a wooden table
from one another near dusk on a late February Friday at a tavern on the
South Side. Their voices are at full throat, amplified by the pints
before them. Fingers wag. Veins tighten in forehead and neck.

The source of their animated discussion is not related to any simmering
familial resentments nor any political tempest du jour. Rather it has to
do with fish sandwiches. Fried fish sandwiches. Because Lent is nigh,
and "The Codfather" is having a sit-down with his top lieutenant.

Marketers hoping to capture the attention of the up and coming 'new
consumer' must personalise, evangelise, humanise, and fetishise if they
are to succeed.

This is the view of Joeri Van den Bergh, marketing professor, author,
and co-founder of InSites Consulting, who is visiting Australia this
week. He said the next consumer generation is coming, and it’s harder to
catch their attention as they feel they are much busier than other
generations, and they are using multiple screens at once.

<th>If Reality Bites has a defining moment, it’s got to be that scene at
the gas station[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQVw58aDt3Y]. Four
20-something friends with uncertain futures are bearing armfuls of
chips, soda, and cigarettes as The Knack’s “My Sharona” starts up on the
radio; three of them immediately drop everything to bop along to the
song. Cut to exterior: The trio dance in the glowing light of the Food
Mart, their car abandoned at the pump to the left, the astral darkness
reaching over it all. The tableau is reminiscent of an Edward Hopper
painting, at once desolate and bright. But the movie’s producer, Michael
Shamberg, compared it to pop
art[https://edruscha.com/works/standard-station-amarillo-texas/].

and a third expect their pensions to even exceed their current wages,

DO YOU think your partner has ‘selective hearing’? Sometimes we might
feel like our partner is choosing not to listen, but the reality is, in
many cases, they just can’t hear you. New research by Australian Hearing
reveals that 2.7 million Aussies believe they are regularly ignored
because their partner or parent has a hearing loss. And this ‘domestic
deafness’ is impacting relationships, especially for married couples and
*Generation X*-ers.

To combat the issue, Australian Hearing is urging Australians to take
part in their Big Aussie Hearing Check, which kicks off during Hearing
Awareness Week (March 3 – 9) and runs until April 12.

Australia's workforce is ageing, with the date at which most people
retire being extended to later and later in life. So more employers are
confronting a new challenge - employees spanning more generations than
ever before. For many that means managing expectations and experience
for workers in their teens through to 60s, 70s and beyond.

LEIGH SALES, PRESENTER: Australia's workforce is ageing, with most
people retiring later in life. That means employers are confronting a
new challenge - a workforce that spans more generations than ever
before, forcing bosses to manage expectations and experience for workers
from their teens to their 70s.

Everywhere you look at the *Gen-X* Tavern in downtown Tampa is a new
piece of memorabilia, another relic of a simpler time.

There are custom-built chandeliers made out of floppy disks, references
to MTV, "Seinfeld" and "Friends" and Ray Finkle's Miami Dolphins jersey
hanging in a locker. (Finkle was a fictional Dolphins player from "Ace
Ventura: Pet Detective.") A massive mural has more than 175 references
to '80s and '90s pop culture, from Tab to Atari to "Mrs. Doubtfire."

After taking a beating in 2018, housing industry equities are showing
early signs of a comeback, arguably signaling potential value
opportunities. But convincing bubble-scarred clients of this can be a
tough sell.

This is the time of year when Americans, caught in the winter doldrums,
start to think about where they’ll go away this summer. (In case you
missed it, Jan. 30 was National Plan for Vacation
Day.)[https://nationaldaycalendar.com/national-plan-for-vacation-day-january-31/]And
while that’s good news for the companies in the U.S. travel and tourism
industry—which generated $1.5 trillion in 2017, according to the World
Travel and Tourism Council—a new study suggests an impediment to growth
may lie ahead.

You’re thinking it’s fear of a recession, but the reason is more
immediate and far more sinister—shame.

One thing we learn in “Captain Marvel” is that it’s pronounced MarVELL,
like the English poet — or at least it used to be, on distant planets
and right here on Earth, a windy rock also known as C-53. That was back
in 1995, when most of this movie takes place and when the world as we
know it had not yet been colonized by the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Yes, of course, Marvel Comics had been around for decades, but when the
heroine crashes through the roof of the Blockbuster Video store, landing
in between the “Family” and “Drama” sections, there are no Avengers or
Iron-Man titles on the shelves.

Work and Social Media Pressures May Be Contributing to the Trend

ST. LOUIS, March 5, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Do you feel "always on" even
when you're supposed to be on vacation? If so, you're not alone, and
according to the fifth annual 2019 Alamo Rent A Car Family Vacation
Survey*, a growing number of Americans are going back to basics with a
simple idea: Unplugging from work, devices and social media during vacation.

There has been an increased focus in recent years on making the law a
happier profession. Step into most offices of Big Law in South Florida
and you will likely see the fruits of these efforts: a more inviting and
open office design, a relaxed dress code and art adorning expansive
white wall spaces. Some firms are even embracing other facets of the new
economy to keep attorneys happy: telecommuting, alternative fee
structures and flex time, among others.

While these are all important developments and should not be discounted,
they do not, in and of themselves, solve the fundamental problem as it
relates to attracting and retaining millennials. Given that this
generation, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, currently
makes up nearly 50 percent of the workforce and will increase to 75
percent by 2030, maximizing their happiness is an essential planning tool.

It is the ultimate *Gen X* playlist. As Triple J’s Hottest 100 turns 30
today — the inaugural countdown was broadcast on March 5, 1989 — fans
are marvelling at the sonic time capsule of their youth.

The first Hot 100 was topped by Joy Division’s darkly melancholic rock
song Love Will Tear Us Apart, was collated from votes by the
yet-to-national station’s Sydney listeners.

Like any new decade, the 1990s did not arrive fully formed. They came
with a pile of the previous decade's holdovers - Milli Vanilli, Michael
J. Fox, Madonna and the usual yawns. Grunge was but a distant rumor, as
was the Internet. What would be next? There were long lists of confident
predictions, barely any of which came true, and probably none of which
foresaw Luke Perry's sideburns.

It was a serviceable but noticeably parched moment in popular culture.
Magazine covers, for their part, were constantly searching for the next
James Dean. Was it Chris Isaak? River Phoenix? Was it any of the young
bucks from "Twin Peaks"?
