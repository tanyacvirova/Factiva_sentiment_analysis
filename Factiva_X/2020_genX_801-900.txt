They pulled no punches. On Wednesday, while Amit Shah's door-to-door
campaign for the Delhi elections was under way in Lajpat Nagar, two
young lawyers unfurled a bedsheet from their balcony containing anti-CAA
slogans, and one of them called out, “Amit Shah, go home”. In a swift
backlash, both were evicted from their rented residence. But the damage
was done. What stood out was the fact that the two girls were unrepentant.

* New research by the International Longevity
Centre-UK[https://ilcuk.org.uk/], published in December, found that
ageism could cost the fashion industry £11 billion (over $14 billion) in
the next 20 years, The
Guardian[https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/jan/05/fashion-industry-ageism-older-consumers]
reported on January 5.

* "For too long the fashion and beauty industries have been
bewilderingly resistant to recognizing just how fashionable and stylish
the generation of older consumers are and want to remain," Diane
Kenwood, an ILC trustee, told the outlet.

Many U.S. companies have been boosting investment in Vietnam’s clean
energy sector to satisfy the surging energy demand of the Southeast
Asian country, the local newswire Icon reported.

One of the notable investors is the Arlington-based AES Corporation.
After investing in a 1,240 megawatts (MW) Mong Duong 2 thermal power
plant in the northern province of Quang Ninh, the U.S. continued to gain
trust from the Vietnamese government to carry out the liquefied natural
gas (LNG)-fueled Son My 2 power project. It has a total investment of $5
billion with a designed capacity of 2.2 gigawatts (GW) and is located in
the central province of Binh Thuan. The Son My 2 will require about 0.6
million tons of LNG yearly for its operation.

As a result of Russia purchasing ad content in the 2016 presidential
elections and increased scrutiny about political advertising on the
platform, Facebook changed its
policy[https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/facebook-announces-major-changes-political-ad-policies-n863416]
in 2018 and began making data on political advertising publicly available.

The strike that began in 2050 puts our country at risk.

Editors’ note: This is part of the Op-Eds From the
Future[https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/future-oped] series, in which
science fiction authors, futurists, philosophers and scientists write
Op-Eds that they imagine we might read 5, 10, 50 or even 200 years from
now. The challenges they predict are imaginary — for now — but their
arguments illuminate the urgent questions of today and prepare us for
tomorrow. The Opinion piece below is a work of fiction.

According to the 2020 Consumer Culture Report from public relations
agency 5WPR, millennial shoppers age 18-34 are more likely to make
impulse purchases (64%) than *Gen X* shoppers age 35-54 (53%) or baby

There is an important story unfolding that will have a dramatic impact
on consumers over the next decade if bricks-and-mortar retailers don't
adapt - and soon.

Thousands of retail stores closed across North America last year, and
the trend is looking to continue in 2020.

creating original digital content for young audiences and working with
third-parties such as Netflix and Twitch.

Up until recently, Kelly Day oversaw the digital content strategy at the

reins to Stefanie Schwartz last month.

On Friday, Washington was the site of the March for Life, an annual
event that focuses largely on abortion, one of the nation's most
controversial issues. There is another life issue that we should pay
attention to this year as well, one that might help unite people across
the political spectrum: the epidemic of suicide.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
47,173 Americans killed themselves during 2017, which is higher in both
number and percentage of the population than at any time since the CDC's
earliest published statistics in 1950. Today, there are two suicides for
every homicide death, and 17 percent more suicide deaths per year than
deaths from motor-vehicle incidents.

Mike Morris, a father of three daughters in a suburb of Dallas, hasn’t
had a traditional cable-TV subscription at his house since 2014. When
his family visits his father-in-law on holidays, he feels good about
that decision all over again.

At home, Morris’s two youngest, ages 8 and 4, only watch shows on
streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime, which don’t show
commercials. But at their granddad’s house, they get a rare glimpse of
broadcast channels such as Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon. Like
clockwork, after about 30 minutes of TV, they come bounding his way,
begging for new toys. “Any toy that has pink on it,” Morris told me,
“it’s ‘Daddy, can I have this? Daddy, can I have this?’”

If you were a teenager in the Lehigh Valley in the ‘80s and ‘90s,
chances are you listened to WLVR when you wanted to hear alternative
bands. The official radio station of Lehigh University, it and all
college radio were an important part of the music scene.

“I’m a firm believer in college radio,” said Christine Dempsey, senior
vice president of radio for Lehigh Valley Public Media, which now
oversees public radio programming at WLVR. “And back in the 80s, that’s
when college radio really broke new artists.”

Flynn examines one's pivot points. Research suggests that one is like
most unbelieving Americans born between the mid-1940s and the mid-1980s.
Among these cohorts (the Boomers and *Gen X*-ers, if one goes in for
such labels), explicit unbelief, atheism, agnosticism, or humanism, was
relatively rare. The only way religious disaffection could grow as
rapidly among members of these cohorts as it did in the later twentieth
century was for many who'd been previously religious to abandon their
faiths. By condensing sometimes amorphous deconversion stories into
bare-bones tellings of that moment when faith's center ceased to hold,
the stories might become shorter and more focused. And that might make
it possible for a much larger number of readers to respond. If this
exercise were carried out, it might make for more than electrifying reading.

As cannabis acceptance becomes widespread, consumer demographics have
shifted to include more women, impacting methods used by businesses to
reach their target audience.San Francisco-based Eaze, an online cannabis
marketplace[https://www.eaze.com/article/eaze-insights-our-annual-state-of-cannabis-report-is-here]
and home delivery service, reported the number of women participating on
their platform increased 81% between 2018 and 2019.That brings the
company’s total proportion of women customers to 40%.That demographic
accounts for a growing proportion of first-time delivery users, too.In
2018, women represented 38% of first-time deliveries, but the figure
increased to 43% in 2019.Eaze, which operates in select markets in
California, responded to the demographic changes by adjusting its
marketing techniques to reach women without alienating existing core
customers.“The way we are trying to attract women is by making sure

Brands have always struggled to maintain market visibility during
election seasons. The media space becomes invaded by political
messaging. This has only intensified in 2020’s unique political climate.

U.S. voters are more politically charged than at any other time in
recent history, throwing the polarization of the electorate into even
sharper focus.

With loan growth expected to continue to slow across several major
product lines in 2020, unsecured debt – either closed-end or revolving –
could be one possible bright spot for credit unions in the year ahead.

But those sectors are slowing too, and a mix of new and old competitors
could make further growth difficult.

In the next 10 years, millennials will be dominating the workforce
globally; Generation Z will comprise 26 percent of the world's
population, and most Baby Boomers will be facing retirement. Such
"seismic demographic shifts," says an international real estate services
firm, are bound to affect the evolution of the world's cities, which
will need to adapt to ensure they attract the businesses and talent that
they need.

According to Cushman & Wakefield, in its recent report "Demographic
Shifts: The World in 2030," the following changes should be expected by
countries across the globe in the next decade:

This article reviews the research contributions of the Center for
Retirement Research at Boston College in its second 10 years of
operation (2008-2017) and the implications of those findings for Social
Security and retirement policy. The article highlights a number of
studies on a variety of topics grouped into three broad and
forward-looking categories: (1) the Social Security program and its role
in retirement security, (2) private retirement saving and its role in
retirement security, and (3) the medical risks and health expenditures
faced by an aging population. The studies address issues such as the
effects associated with labor force patterns, changes in the nation's
retirement system, and growing life spans. In its 20 years, the center's
contributions have expanded both the breadth and the depth of knowledge
on issues relevant to retirement security in general and Social Security
in particular.

Ada Calhoun had a rough year. Fortunately, the process of writing her
latest book prepared her for it.

Two years ago, a cri de coeur of an
essay[http://www.oprah.com/sp/new-midlife-crisis.html] addressing why
middle-aged women were overwhelmed and exhausted went viral. Its author,
Ada Calhoun[https://www.adacalhoun.com/], ended up writing an entire
book[https://groveatlantic.com/book/why-we-cant-sleep/] on the subject:
“Why We Can’t Sleep: Women’s New Midlife Crisis" (out this month).

JUVENILE JUSTICE NEWS

In the previous Corrections Today article (November/December 2019, Vol.
81 No. 6), we examined some of the factors influencing staff retention -
i.e. agency/ facility culture, job satisfaction, staff health and
wellness, and staff perceptions of safety. This article will focus on
research and strategies related to recruiting, hiring and onboarding
direct care staff. Brief descriptions of concepts selected from the CJCA
Toolkit: Staff Recruiting, Hiring, and Retaining Qualified Staff offer
readers exposure to recruitment-related research, provide an opportunity
for jurisdictions to reflect on current agency/facility practices and
support facilities in exploring effective solutions to recruitment and
hiring challenges. Additional information can be found in the CJCA Toolkit.

This media is not available on this platform.

As the music business continues to grow and change, we've decided that
it's time for our annual Power List to do the same. This year, instead
of attempting to compare the relative influence of the top label
executives with that of the biggest managers and concert promoters,
we've decided to organize the industry's most powerful figures by
sector, then listed them alphabetically. (That sound you hear is the
business' publicists breathing a collective sigh of relief.)

Fashion works in cyclical mode: Classic and Fad. The purpose is one.
Style. In the 1920s, Coco Chanel andJean Patou gave the world the Little
Black Dress. A 100 years on, it remains the epitome of cool and sexy.
Sabyasachi Mukherjee was a street peddler in Kolkata two decades ago
selling baubles packed in plastic boxes; today he runs a fashion empire
worth close to $35 million and climbing. By his own admission, over
5,000 women have worn his dresses, from billionaire brides to middle
class girls, all of whom who want to be the next ‘Sabyasachi Bride’ with
the Sabyasachi Makeover taken from his hit TV show Band Baajaa Bride.
The trendsetter is on the way to upending the business, posting online
fashion shows onInstagram. Fashion is the business of selling dreams: in
China a girl saves three months’ salary to buy aLouis Vuitton handbag.
For a style to become a trend today, it must be aspirational enough to
bridge the gap between the wealthy and the wannabes.

The 2020 Democratic primary has been highly volatile, with one candidate
after another rising — Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg —
and then falling, as Democratic primary voters, locked in on the
singular task of ousting Donald Trump, bounced from one hopeful to the
next. Over the course of the year, Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden stayed
relatively flat, each with their own stubborn base of support. In the
final month before the caucus, people have continued to shift, with many
who’d been skeptical of Sanders moving his direction, and Biden fading a
bit in the polls.

When Deb Thea’s friend Alice died suddenly of cancer, her heart when out
to the husband she left behind. Defying her friend’s wishes for no
services, Thea took it upon herself to organize a memorial, knowing that
the people who loved her, including Tom Ford, her husband of 36 years,
needed ritual in order to grieve.

Afterwards,” she said, “I would keep an eye on him.” She would swing by
his workshop in San Anselmo with antiques she needed fixing or wrap a
sandwich and drop it off. Her mission was only to offer a little comfort
and kindness.

It is becoming almost essential for businesses to provide an interface
displaying all the information about the product including price, specs
and availability, so that buyers can make informed choices. When
considering a purchase, B2B buyers spend the majority (27%) of time in
researching independently online, according to Gartner.  Forrester
states that B2B buying experiences are now garnering attention with 80%
of B2B buyers expecting the same buying experience as B2C customers.
Hence, it is extremely important for B2B commerce companies to quickly
set up infrastructure to support the same.

before giving way to flat rural land as far as the eye can see. Just shy
of a turn known as Twenty-Mile Bend, the roadside vista abruptly
switches back to suburban landscaping and the entryway and gatehouse for
Arden, a 2,000-home master planned community.

There, in August, husband and wife Charles Santos and Elyce Arcieri,
expecting their first child, closed on a three-bedroom Florida
Craftsman-style home on Wandering Willow Way, one more
Millennial-generation couple putting down stakes in the suburbs.

Playmobil now wants a role in your workplace too

On a dreary, cool spring day in Zirndorf, Germany, I finally realized a
childhood dream of visiting the Playmobil headquarters. The feeling was
relatively bittersweet, as I ate a Wiener schnitzel for lunch, alone on
a weekday, in the beer garden at the uncrowded Playmobil FunPark, next
door to the corporate offices. Playmobil had been my favorite toy as a
kid, though it’s been four decades since my parents brought home my
first set — a Wild West fort — from a trip abroad, before it was widely
available in the United States. My own kids are teenagers now and have
no time for the Playmobil Vikings or pirates or Arctic explorers or
airport we used to play with together when they were younger — something
I miss. They never even want to set up the Playmobil remote control
train station during the holidays anymore. Everything remains boxed up
in the basement.

It is becoming almost essential for businesses to provide an interface
displaying all the information about the product including price, specs
and availability, so that buyers can make informed choices. Forrester
estimates that ~74% of B2B buyers research half or more of their B2B
purchases online before making a purchase.

The question that so many Americans are asking today is, how do we unite
our nation once again? In the midst of so much division, how can we
remember that we are “one nation under God?”

Today’s guest is best-selling author, journalist, and political
commentator Sophia Nelson, who dives into the topic of unity in America
and exhorts us to remember that the Founding Fathers “never said we had
to agree all the time.”

How do your retirement savings compare to savings by other people in
your age group? Are you keeping up with the proverbial Joneses? Ahead of
them? Or are you behind?

You might be surprised by the competition. 401(k) balances built by U.S.
savers ranged from an average of $137,300 for millennials as of Sept. 30
up to $366,100 for baby boomers, according to Fidelity Investments.

While everyone is complaining about boomers, Gen Z doesn't want you to
forget to complain about *Generation X*, the other generation that's
significantly older than them that also sucks. This sucking is embodied
by the name Karen, the young people have noticed - middle-aged white
moms who are always asking for the manager and calling the police on
perfectly fine pool parties and wondering why kids are so obsessed with
their identities.

I am a Gen Xer, but I can only say to the Gen Zs, I feel you on the
Karen thing so hard. Having a Karen as a mom must suck, but also, just
imagine having thousands of Karens as your constant nemeses, for your
whole life.

Nearly 30 years ago, it may have seemed to others as if it had
everything: a thriving career I loved and two young children. However, I
was still awake at night, worried that I would fall short, both at work
and at home.

Unscared by the costs of five-figure childcare and the difficulty of
setting limits on my working hours, I left two newspaper jobs I loved in
quick succession. She was an office manager, then a part-time
journalist. And then none.

(Reuters) - U.S. linguists on Friday chose "they" as their Word of the
Decade, recognizing the growing use of third-person plural pronouns as a
singular form to refer to people who identify their gender as neither
entirely male nor entirely female.

Separately, the American Dialect Society bestowed its Word of the Year
honors on the increasingly common practice of introducing oneself in
correspondence or socially by the set of pronouns one prefers to be
called by - declaring in an email, for example, "pronouns: she/her."

Applebee's? Yes, please. The burgers are nice enough, the beer is crisp,
and I'm not the sort of diner who needs an elaborate menu back story
down to the provenance of the pickles. My kids enjoy the Kraft macaroni
and cheese and the table-side payment screens that double as gaming
machines. The more they like a restaurant, it seems, the more awkward
the nickname they cook up for it. I'm pretty sure Crapplesneeze works
out to a three-star review.

Shares of the parent company, Dine Brands Global (ticker: DIN), should
be a treat at 11 times earnings. The economy has been growing for a
decade, and the stock market is piercing new highs, so consumers should
feel flush. Plus, restaurants have gone from a quarter of food spending
in the 1950s to slightly more than half today. All nine analysts who
cover Dine Brands say to buy shares.

If you belong to one of the previous generations (babyboomer and
*generation x*), or if you are a member of the later generation
(centanial) this information interests you.

Much has been said about how some chiefs or leaders complain bitterly
and move from despair to frustration with members of the Millennial
generation (those born between 1980 and 1997) and as "their attitudes"
that I have already mentioned in collaborations they generate those
levels of anxiety, but... what happens when a Milenial is your boss? Let
us start, therefore, that the word chief here is important, for if this
character had earned the title of leader, you would not even be reading
this humble contribution, for that guide would not generate controversy
and the life of his subordinates would be strongly moved and improved
thanks to the contribution of a Millennial leader.

Generation Z consumers-those 16 to 24 years old-are causing a generation
divide when it comes to online payment preferences, suggests research
commissioned by Paysafe, which found that Gen Z consumers are much more
likely than other generations to embrace a wider range of alternative
payment methods.

Forty percent of Gen Z have some experience of in-app payments and 15%
make them regularly-significantly higher than all other consumers (27%
and nine percent). Thirty-four percent of Gen Z have used a mobile
wallet (vs. 26% of other consumers) and 14% (vs. 10%) regularly make
payments with one. Additionally, one-quarter of Gen Z regularly or
occasionally use prepaid pins and 29% have made online purchases using a
cash-based system (vs. 17% and 24% of all other consumers).

While other advanced economies have embraced digital and card payments,
Italy remains stubbornly attached to coins and banknotes. But far from
being put off by Italy's long-running love affair with cash, fintechs
say there is a major opportunity to grow their businesses there in
mobile and card payments.

Cash is king

The prime minister's chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, is advertising
jobs both as his special assistant and in civil service posts in Downing
Street. He has said he does not want "confident, public school bluffers"
and is instead searching for people with "unusual qualities":
"super-talented weirdos, wild cards, artists" and "people who never went
to university, weirdos from William Gibson novels ...".

Boomers, MY SON INFORMED ME, ARE RADICAL BREXITEERS, CLIMATECHANGE
deniers and would like to arrest and possibly kill all teenagers

It's Saturday, in the middle of the night, and I'm driving on a narrow
country road, hedges riding high on either side. On the radio is one of
those programmes designed to keep insomniacs company, and twice in a
short stretch startled animals I haven't seen since childhood books leap
into my headlamp beams — a badger, a stoat. As the road broadens beside
a wood, I see a red car ahead, stopped, its hazards flickering like a
signal lamp. Beside it are an elderly couple; he is in black tie and she
in a shimmering gown and fur stole. I slow down. Their boot is flipped
and he is retrieving what looks like a jack. They have a flat tyre, I
guess. They probably need help. At their age, in their clothes, changing
it will be a mucky, strenuous job.

As rents continue to steadily rise across the U.S., about a quarter of
renters[i] say affording their rent payments is difficult or very
difficult. To make ends meet, two-thirds of those renters make at least
one financial sacrifice to afford their home, and half wouldn’t be able
to afford an unexpected $1,000 expense, according to the 2019 Zillow
Group Consumer Housing Trends Report.

Discretionary spending on leisure activities is the most likely to go
spending on entertainment was cut by 38% of renters, making it the top
response. Supplementing income is the next most common course of action,
especially for younger renters. A quarter of all renters pick up a
second job or more hours at their current job.

With the start of the Consumer Electronics Show, research shows
continuing smart TV growth, especially among young consumers. Accessing
OTT platforms is one major reason.

Parks Associates says 77% of smart TVs owned by U.S. broadband homes are
now connected to the internet -- up from 62% in 2014. Ninety percent of
U.S. broadband households own at least one TV set, and 50% own at least
one smart TV while 40% own only basic TV sets.

The “incoming recession” seems all anyone can talk about over the past
few months. Just look to some of the foremost headlines in financial
media, which repeat the word over and over again.

While this may seem like fear-mongering, there is evidence to suggest
that danger for the economy is on the horizon: the yield curve between
certain bonds has crossed negative — a signal seen prior to some of the
most notable recessions of the past four decades; the Federal Reserve is
intervening in the so-called repo market; there is an ongoing trade
conflict between the U.S. and China along with South Korea and Japan; a
war may erupt in the Middle East yet again; and so on and so forth.

India, Jan. 3 -- Honor is gearing for its next major smartphone launch
in India. Last year, Honor India President Charles Peng had confirmed
that the company would launch Honor 8X successor in India soon. And now,
it seems that the company is finally ready to launch what could very
well be its first smartphone launch in India this year.

Honor has been sharing teasers of its next *generation X*-series
smartphone via its official Twitter handle for quite sometime now. Now,
the company has shared a teaser of the phone, that is, the Honor 9X, on
Flipkart. Interestingly, the teaser on the e-retail site doesn't
explicitly state that Honor's upcoming smartphone will be called Honor
9X. Rather, it teases the phone using the catchphrase 'Experience soon',
indicating that the phone would be launched in India soon.

The cartoonist Gary Larson has finally agreed to create an official
online home( https://www.thefarside.com/[https://www.thefarside.com/] )
for his classic one-panel strip The Far Side, setting off a wave of
nostalgia among *Generation X*-ers. These could almost be defined as the
people who grew up surrounded by newspaper comics - sleeping in bedrooms
filled with Garfield paperbacks, then taking their first jobs in offices
where every cubicle had Larson favourites or Dilberts tacked to the
wall. And then we watched a life-defining artistic medium drop dead with
unusual, heartbreaking finality.

Around the globe, Classical music is top choice to soothe customer
support frustrations

SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 9, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Team Kate or Team Meghan,
vinegar or tomato-based barbecue sauce, paying college athletes or not
-- there are plenty of things that divide us today. But what's something
that opposing factions can agree on? Consumers around the globe concur
that when it comes to waiting on hold for customer support, it's
Classical tunes that are music to their ears. In fact, nearly 30% of
those surveyed said if they could choose their own "hold" music, they'd
opt for the likes of Bach and Beethoven over country crooners or hip-hop
heroes. These findings are courtesy of Genesys(R), the global leader in
omnichannel customer experience and contact center solutions.

Peter Minshall, a longtime real estate developer and investor in the
Baltimore-Washington region, made a strategic decision five years ago to
stop buying office buildings and invest in properties that are far less
sexy: industrial warehouses.

Demand for office space has been shrinking rapidly as growth in the
working-age population has slowed and advances in technology have
allowed companies to digitize files that once took up lots of square
footage. As Minshall sees it, the pace of this downsizing is only going
to accelerate as firms eliminate support staff and permit - and even
encourage - more employees to telecommute.

There's rising uncertainty about how a sizable piece of the credit union
industry's loan portfolio will perform this year.

First mortgage volumes continue to rise at credit unions, but home
equity lines of credit have fallen dramatically in recent years,
dropping from 7.8% growth in October 2017 to 4.9% a year later and just
1.8% in October of 2018, according to the latest Credit Union Trends
Report from CUNA Mutual Group. Growth rates for second mortgages - which
tend to be closed-end loans rather than open ended lines of credit like
a HELOC - are also down, though not as significantly. Second mortgage
growth was at 9% annually as of October, down from 10.6% one year prior.

Before 2009, Canadians looking to place their money in a tax-efficient
investment vehicle had one option: the registered retirement savings
plan (RRSP). Since then, the introduction of the tax-free savings
account (TFSA) has given financial advisors and investors plenty to mull
over.

That’s because each vehicle has its own unique benefits and can help
investors achieve their goals. Sometimes the products can be used in
conjunction. There’s no shortage of ways for advisors and investors
looking to make the most of RRSPs and TFSAs.

More than $15 trillion in assets is expected to be passed to younger
generations in the next decade, including a lot of art. But will they
want it?

The numbers vary wildly, but all are dizzying: $15 trillion. $30
trillion. $59 trillion. $68 trillion.

People born in the 1960s may be the last human beings who will get to
live out their full actuarial life expectancies.

'Climate change now represents a near- to mid-term existential threat'
to humanity, warns a recent policy paper by an Australian think tank.
Civilization, scientists say, could collapse by 2050. Some people may
survive. Not many.

India, Jan. 9 -- Remember Steven Spielberg's 2001 sci-fi drama A.I.
Artificial Intelligence, where David - a prototype Mecha child capable
of experiencing love - is given to Henry Swinton and his wife Monica,
whose son Martin contracted a rare disease? Turns out, 19 years after
the film released, the concept of an emphatic 'artificial human' has
become a reality with Samsung-backed Star Labs unveiling Neon at CES 2020.

A computationally created virtual being, NEON looks and behaves just
like a real human and is capable of showing emotions and intelligence,
the company says, adding that it is not an AI assistant, but "a friend,"
who can connect and learn more about humans, gain new skills, and
eventually evolve.
