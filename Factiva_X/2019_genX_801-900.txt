SINGAPORE: There is a reason why cab drivers are often referred to as
taxi uncles.

Most are of an older generation and a huge proportion remain men. There
is no data to back this but, anecdotally, in my last 10 taxi rides, all
of them fit this category.

CHART THAT TELLS A STORY

What does the chart show? It shows UK median household wealth over the
past decade, broken down by age group. Baby boomers — or at least those
aged over 65 — are the group to have experienced the greatest increase
in their household wealth during that period, with a rise of 96 per cent.

THEY are Disney-loving, celebrity and brand-obsessed youngsters, who
bare their souls, selves and sense of social responsibility on social media.

They care passionately about social equality and the environment, and
are committed to making the world a better place for future generations.
If the causes they care about are championed by celebrities, so much the
better.

In the past, stroke and heart attacks were associated with elderly
people. So, individuals in their 20s and 30s thought stroke and heart
attacks won't affect them, thinking that they were young. And if they
eat the right foods and were not sedentary, they believed cardiovascular
diseases won't hit them. Today, those can be false assumptions.

In recent years, heart and stroke patients are no longer the usual
"seniors." They are now getting younger and cut through all social
classes. Stroke and heart attacks are no longer the diseases of the rich
or the sedentary.

Speakers during a Jan. 9 streaming video panel at the annual Consumer

Research findings suggest that employers could do a better job of
educating employees about benefits that may improve their overall
financial security.

Employee benefits can address the underlying causes of financial stress,
but it is important for plan sponsors to recognize that different
workers have different needs, which may make them take interest in a
different spectrum of benefit programs, according to the Employee
Benefit Research Institute (EBRI).

Why didn't Donald Trump get the money for the wall through Congress when
the Republicans were in the majority in both Houses? He had two years to
do it (Trump quits wall talks in ???tantrum''' , January 11). Now he is
screwing up the lives of thousands of workers and blaming the Democrats.
It makes no sense. - Sue Milliken, Queens Park

A temper tan-Trump. - Paul Conneely, Sanctuary Point
