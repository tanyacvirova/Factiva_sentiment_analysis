When the Caprice Nightclub closed on Granville Street two years ago and
was replaced by the Colony, a multilevel bar with Ping-Pong and arcade
games, that marked a shift in Vancouver’s downtown to a different
generation.

New Hope Study Indicates That "Treaters" Are Dominating Supplement Purchasing Patterns 
 

MILLVILLE, N.J., Feb. 26, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- BodyBio, the leader in
fatty acid research for the last 20 years, has identified two key groups
of supplement consumers: treaters and preventers. A recent New Hope
study with nearly 500 participants of avid supplement users indicates
that supplement purchases are made for two predominate reasons: to
mitigate symptoms for ongoing ailments or prevent future health
problems. BodyBio anticipates this finding will guide supplement
purchasing patterns in 2020 and beyond.

Business can no longer sit on the fence when it comes to addressing
environmental and social issues, with a new survey showing employees
want their companies to play stronger leadership roles in society,
Atlassian co-founder and chief executive Mike Cannon-Brookes says.

Declaring business has reached a "tipping point", Mr Cannon-Brookes will
on Tuesday use his speech at The Australian Financial Review Business
Summit to release a survey of 1200 workers conducted by PwC, which backs
his decision to speak out on issues, especially climate change.

Gen Z takes a more sensible approach to job hunting, and everything else

‘Times are bad. Children no longer obey their parents, and everyone is
writing a book”. Cicero, to whom that line is attributed, was not the
last to look at a younger generation and see a bunch of feckless
narcissists. It is no different for Generation Z, those born between the
mid 1990s and early 2010s. Their image is one of perpetually offended
“snowflakes” who refuse to confront facts they find uncomfortable. Yet
research shows that there is a steely eyed pragmatism to Gen Z,
particularly when compared with the generation before them, the millennials.

It looks like Disney-Pixar, the folks behind an array of wonderful
animated films such as “Toy Story,” “Finding Nemo,” and my personal
favorite, the marvelous but underrated “Ratatouille,” has decided to
dive headfirst into the LGBT universe.

Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar Animation Studios have announced that
“Onward,” their next animated movie, will feature—for the first time
ever—a lesbian main character.

CRYSTAL BALLING: Realtor Bob Rennie and his Rennie Group's intelligence
VP, Andrew Ramlo, helped Independent Contractors and Business
Association conventioneers digest their bacon and eggs recently. The
association president, Chris Gardner, had already told breakfasting
colleagues that trade workers'wages will increase by 5.2 per cent this
year, that 54 per cent of contractors can't obtain enough workers, and
that only the Slovak Republic is slower than B.C. among 35 jurisdictions
issuing building permits. Rennie and Ramlo's "demographic crunch"
projections included Canadian immigration admissions surging to 350,000
by 2021 (B.C.'s share to be 15 per cent). An aging population and
climate change will be the economy's greatest challenges, they said.

The banking crash has made Ireland the world's worst stock market for
value seekers such as those who follow the creed of legendary investor
Warren Buffett according to a study of longterm investment returns
published by Credit Suisse.

"Ireland has been very poor for value investors because the Irish banks
were deemed value stocks and they suffered terribly in the global
financial crisis," said Paul Marsh of London Business School, who
compiled the study with his colleague Mike Staunton and with Elroy
Dimson of Cambridge University.

Middle-class Americans are forsaking marriage amid financial insecurity,
effectively making the institution more of a luxury good enjoyed by
prosperous Americans.

The middle three-fifths of U.S. earners have experienced the sharpest
declines in marriage rates over the past four decades compared with
people at the bottom of the income ladder and those at the top,
according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of census data from 1980 to
2018, the most recent available. These households earned from $25,000 to
$125,000 in 2018.

2020 MAR 8 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Medical
Devices & Surgical Technology Week -- Investigators publish new report
on Surgery - General Surgery. According to news reporting from San
Antonio, Texas, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, "Numerous
authors have described the millennial generation, defined as a cohort of
people born between the early 1980s and late 1990s, as unique from
preceding generations, such as *Generation X* and the baby boomers. Many
surgical educators generally belong to elder generations, and there is
some concern that intergenerational differences may be source of
friction between teacher and learner."

UK director Alex Garland thinks Parasite’s recent sweep of the Oscars is
proof positive that audiences are smarter than studios give them credit
for. Ahead of the release of his new sci-fi series, the cerebral,
mind-bending Devs, Garland says film and television viewers are being
“patronised” by a studio system propped up by superhero movies and
action blockbusters and over-reliant on focus groups to the point that
new and original ideas struggle to get a look-in.

“There were a lot of people out there who dug Parasite and if you
proposed Parasite within a focus group, nobody would say ‘yeah, that’s a
good idea, go ahead and make it’.

A show that promised to be a ‘love letter’ to the Mexican enclave
illustrates the delicate balance in moving forward while maintaining roots

There’s a moment in Gentefied when a Latinx character finds out that the
wealthy white patron about to offer them work is working with the people
undermining her family’s life in the Los Angeles enclave of Boyle
Heights. It’s a dilemma that the show’s co-creator, Marvin Lemus,
experienced for himself after moving to nearby East Hollywood after college.

The world is in the midst of a crisis in the labour market. Talent
shortages are at all-time highs and unemployment rates don't drop
enough. Solutions are then required for the future of work and
employees. A Manpower Group study revealed that more than half of
companies around the world can't find the skills they're looking for,
nearly double what it was a decade ago. "As part of the jobs we do, we
see that there is a big gap between the skills that are required in
companies and those that people are trained with. In Colombia this also
happens, that is, 54% of employers worldwide, and also in this country,
they do not have how to find their talent," explained Javier Echeverri
Hincapié, president of ManpowerGroup Colombia. In addition, companies
are facing digitization and automation. Alongside this, most employers
in the world are increasing or maintaining their payrolls, but job roles
change faster and that's why we also have to work on attracting,
building and maintaining talent.

City of Fremantle mayor Brad Pettitt is preparing a tilt at state
politics as WA's Greens assemble a 'dream team' of candidates which
could include prominent forests campaigner Jess Beckerling along with
party leader Alison Xamon.

Long-serving Greens MP Robin Chapple has also signalled his intention to
retire at the next election, which means the party's next crop of
leaders would all hail from '*Generation X*'.

The first time I tried on makeup I was six years old and my older sister
decided to cover me in sickly raspberry-coloured glittery lipstick
following the “more is better” mantra and the ethos, “it’s not on the
lips, it’s around the lips.”

For members of *Generation X* like myself, the definitive presidential
landslide was President Ronald Reagan's defeat of Walter Mondale in
1984. Reagan won 49 states and beat Mondale in the popular vote by 18

McGovern by 23 points in voting and 503 electoral votes.

Most women of a certain age - let's say *Generation X* or older - will
remember reading Judy Blume's "Are You There God? It's Me Margaret."
That seminal YA novel published in 1970 was how many young girls learned
about, and how to cope with, their periods. And as many of those same
women enter perimenopause in the years before their periods end, what
they need is a sequel.

More than three-quarters of women aged 35-50 say they have never been
taught a thing about perimenopause, according to a survey by BalmLabs, a
skin care company created for women in the "peri" phase - and this is a
truth that is echoed by experts in the field of women's hormones.

As the world's digitalisation has become an opportunity as well as a
challenge for many, some information technology experts are organising a
one-day Digital Pakistan Conference at the Pearl Continental Hotel on
April 15 to address the potential and grievances of the virtual marketplace.

Addressing a news conference at the Karachi Press Club's seminar hall,
AMFCO Technologies CEO Maroof Ayub said that in this country people may
not have electricity reaching their homes but they have at least one
smartphone in their family, which creates a huge progress opportunity.

Adam Smith, the philosophical father of modern capitalism, may have been
Scottish, but his ideas have long found their muse in America.

Smith’s “voice has been ringing in the world’s ears for sixty years”,
wrote one observer in 1838, “but it is only in the United States that he
is listened to, reverenced, and followed.”

Advisers have been urged to tap into the '£36bn wealth of *generation x*
and millennial women' as part of Parmenion’s ‘Advise Her’ campaign.

The platform and discretionary manager launched the campaign earlier
this month to champion better advice for women, who it argues are both
influencers and owners of “huge swathes” of uninvested wealth in the UK.

Searching for academic information beyond the enlocated Google,
interacting as in class, but virtualally making self-edited audiovisual
shorts to teach demonstrate that the use of Information and
Communication Technologies (ICTs) stages a new landscape in the
classroom and gradually changes the profile of teachers and students.
But, most importantly, it gives several advantages beyond how attractive
a device or app can be. What are the real benefits?

The Director of Virtual Education at the Universidad Privada del Valle,
Aaron Rioja, emphasizes that the use of technology in the classroom
brings several advantages in academic terms such as: time savings,
student motivation and better understanding of concepts. However, it
clarifies that this is possible as long as ICTs are accompanied by good
pedagogy. "At the end of the module and/or semester, technology will
continue to be one more medium, not an end," he adds.

The Securities and Exchange Commission's best-interest standard is
slated to take effect in a little more than four months, but there are
still plenty of fights left with respect to regulating the industry.

A high-profile lawsuit continues to linger and the first state moved on
Feb. 21 to implement a fiduciary standard of its own, but financial
services professionals nevertheless are preparing for the implementation
of the SEC standard on June 30.

Elisabeth Briggs finds calm in clicking small, interlocking bricks
together and turning piles of multicolored plastic into something
recognizable.

Sometimes she has a beer while playing with Lego bricks — at 37, she's
allowed — or watches TV. But she keeps the instructions close by,
following them to the block.

All across America, millennials are facing off against baby boomers in a
political tug-of-war. In the Democratic primary, the first millennial
presidential candidate, Pete Buttigieg, is competing against four main
candidates in their 70s. In the House of Representatives, a youthful
freshman class in their 30s is shaking up an institution run by those in
their late 70s.

And politicians and voters everywhere are trying to balance the
priorities of boomers (tax cuts, lower spending, protecting Social
Security and Medicare) with those of millennials and Gen Z (fighting
climate change, eradicating student debt and promoting social justice).

hurdle, followed by financial status (24 per cent) and a difficult jobs
market (21 per cent), according to LinkedIn's second annual Opportunity

Generation Y customers are increasingly satisfied with the way their
banks dole out advice via digital channels, and that’s driving an
overall improvement in customer satisfaction, according to a recent J.D.
Power study.

Out of all the generational cohorts surveyed in the firm’s third annual
retail banking advice study, people born between 1977 and 1995 were the
most satisfied with retail banking advice. Overall satisfaction scores
for that group, often referred to as millennials, jumped 10 points from
last year, to 855 on a 1,000-point scale.

Shannen Doherty and I graduated high school the same year, even though
hers was the fictional West Beverly High and mine was in New York. We've
never met, but she feels like a friend and someone I greatly admire. So
I found myself in tears on Tuesday when I read Doherty's breast cancer
had
returned[https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/04/entertainment/shannen-doherty-cancer-trnd/index.html]
after a remission.

Before the age of influencers, streaming and WiFi in every home (I'm now
44), we had basic big-box television. As a young teenager obsessed with
all things Hollywood, Doherty was a major player in a world I could only
glimpse on that TV, in her role as Brenda Walsh in "Beverly Hills, 90210."

Fixed maturity plans are popular with HSBC Private Banking clients. As a
result, the lender introduced four FMPs last year.

But it removed products too, such as energy infrastructure, natural
resources and European multi-asset strategies due to low demand, shared

influencing, indeed in many cases driving their travel decisions,
according to new research from Expedia Group Media Solutions.

The research underscores the notion that cultural and once-in-a-lifetime
experiences, exploring new destinations and interactive activities, are

One of the weird things about being a mother is witnessing the casual
sexism of the schoolyard - and how it can somehow become a marker of
your own uncoolness when you snort at it.

First there were the "your mum" or "yo mama" jokes which are still a
mark of social currency in our neighbourhood. Like: "Your mum's so
stupid she puts lipstick on her forehead to make up her mind. Your mum's
so stupid, she stared at a carton of apple juice for 12 hours because it
said concentrate."

Indore: Indoreans love for food is well documented. But, Indoreans love
their tea too. They love to discuss varied subjects while sipping
steaming hot tea from a 'kulhad' (mud cups) at small roadside tea stalls
which with passage of time came to be known as 'thiyaas' ( a place where
people can sit or stand and discuss all topics beneath the sky even with
strangers).

These thiyaas were a part and parcel of daily life style of common
Indoreans. Some of these thiyaas even acquired cult figure so much so
that visiting it became a part of daily routine for many.

To win the hearts of customers, e-commerce retailers need to minimize
one particular cost.

According to the fourth annual “Reimagining Commerce” global survey from
omnichannel marketing platform provider Episerver, a leading 76% of
respondents would be dissuaded from making a planned online purchase if
shipping was too expensive. This response was significantly more popular
than the next two most popular reasons – slow website load times (57%)
and bad product descriptions (52%).

CALGARY, Alberta, March 02, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- A survey conducted
by Ipsos on behalf of MNP Ltd. helps identify some of the costly money
mistakes Canadians are making that could be contributing to the mounting
consumer debt challenges across the country. From making only minimum
payments to borrowing money they can’t afford to pay back, the survey
found that over half of Canadians (53%) admit to engaging in what debt
experts consider risky financial behaviours over the past year.

It is impossible to pinpoint the moment that *Gen X* culture hit its
zenith, but one could make a sound case for sometime in 1994. That year
was major: Tonya vs. Nancy, Pulp Fiction, Weezer's “Buddy Holly,” the
birth of lad mags, the death of Kurt Cobain, the debut of Friends and, a
few months later, “the Rachel.” In fashion, that was when grunge crossed
over from mildewed Seattle rock venues into suburban malls—a
trickle-down effect of Marc Jacobs's spring 1993 collection for Perry
Ellis, which put supermodels in flannel and knit beanies (and later got
the designer fired). Soon, brands were bending sideways to appeal to
next-gen consumers, whom they imagined to be disaffected, wary of being
marketed to, and more or less against buying things. So how do you sell
consumer goods to anti-consumerists?

According to Mondi’s online survey of over 2,000 people aged 16-75
across the UK conducted by Ipsos MORI, the majority of British consumers
say they would switch to a different brand if it uses less packaging
than other do. Southerners outside of London are the most likely to make
the switch, with Londoners, Scots and the Welsh trailing behind.

FAYETTEVILLE, North Carolina, March 2 (Sputnik) - Rusty Goins
disembowels a kitchen closet to retrieve cast iron pans, stainless steel
pans, copper pans, an impressive array of cookware with one exception.
There is no Teflon in his entire home.

A retired North Carolina engineer has his reasons to detest it​​​.
Manufacturing a signature non-stick coating involves per- and
polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) that - a necessary caveat - burn down
during the process and don not make it into the final product.

Out of all generations in the workplace, millennials are struggling the
most when it comes to their finances, due to high student loan debt and
lack of savings, according to a new study.

Thirty seven percent of millennials would not be able to come up with
$2,000 in 30 days, compared to 34% of *Gen X* and 23% of baby boomers,
according to the report by the TIAA Institute and the George Washington
University’s Global Financial Literacy Excellence Center (GFLEC).
Millennials tend to rely more heavily on debt and engage more frequently
in expensive short- and long-term money management behaviors to deal
with financial shortfalls. They also display lower financial literacy
than older working-age adults, the study finds.

Mumbai, Feb. 29 -- Having played one of the most iconic vamps on
television, Urvashi Dholakia is popularly remembered as Komolika. Of
late, Urvashi's whacky videos with her son, Ksitij Dholakia, have been
making the rounds online and garnering a great response. Many people
have commented that the duo seem more like friends and less like mother
and son.

Speaking about her relationship with her sons, Ksitij and Sagar, Urvashi
says, "I embraced motherhood at a very young age. I am not a
quintessential parent who dictates what should and shouldn't be done.
Yes, my sons and I are like friends and our house is truly the mad house
of Dholakias. We talk about everything and anything, and I believe that
when the bonds are strong, you don't need to dictate but rather, be by
their side. Today, there are times when they give me advice like joining
TikTok and making videos, while I give them career advice."

now making diversity an integral part of their hiring strategy and are

Some pretty momentous events happened 50 years ago: the U.S. voting age
was lowered from 21 to 18; Paul McCartney announced the Beatles were
disbanding; and Cotton Incorporated was formed in response to an
increased use of synthetic fibers for apparel.

Funded by enterprising growers of upland cotton, cotton importers, and
cotton-product makers, Cotton Incorporated was formed to promote the use
of cotton and build markets for it. The funds from America’s cotton
producers continue to go toward the not-for-profit’s research into
decreasing farming costs and improving sustainable practices, developing
textile innovations and promoting cotton goods.

Australians have been warned not to “panic sell” their shares and make
rash decisions following a disastrous week on the nation’s sharemarket.

Share portfolios and super fund balances took a massive hit after the
nation’s benchmark ASX200 index plunged by 9.8 per cent last week and
wiped $210 billion from its value.

Australia’s business leaders need to step up and be vocal about
important issues like climate change, according to Atlassian co-CEO and
billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes, who says workers — particularly
millennials — will leave businesses that don’t fit their personal values.

Tech outfit Atlassian commissioned a study from PwC that found 39 per
cent of employees agreed or strongly agreed that if their employer was
to act in a way that didn’t align with their values, they would quit
their job.

The Colgate brand is getting in on the microbiome beauty and wellness
movement with a small collection of oral and personal care products
formulated with prebiotics.

The brand sees this first step into microbiome personal care as an
opportunity for consumer education (and perhaps as a proof-of-concept
exercise as well).

India, Feb. 22 -- Time was when people my age were expected to have,
apart from the mandatory two children - one boy, one girl - a home, car,
sizeable bank balance and sufficient standing in respectable society to
their name. With 'respectable society' itself a contentious concept
these days, stragglers like myself are somewhat vindicated in our
dismissal of all the traditional markers of progress. This loosening of
norms should ideally have eased life for us. But no. Where there is a
human, there is a way to make existence more complicated than it needs
to be. My generation of pre-millennials (I reject those classifications
that slot me in the millennial category as ageist) is plagued by its own
set of insurmountable issues, some of which are listed below.

The guilt trap

THE Department of Energy (DOE) has recently cleared the power projects

country.

The 1,100-MW natural gas-fired power plant project of Batangas Clean
Energy Inc., a company controlled by taipan Lucio Tan, is the biggest
project in the DOEs October- November 2019 list of companies issued with

There was a phone call, sure. But as their new FX techno-thriller
suggests, their creative partnership may have started with the Big Bang.

Never accuse Alex Garland of thinking small. From his *Gen-X* touchstone
novel, ''The Beach,'' to his mind-bending science-fiction movies ''Ex
Machina'' and ''Annihilation,'' the British writer and director has
spent his career exploring grand ideas like utopianism and artificial
intelligence, in multiple mediums. Now he's attempting television with
''Devs,'' an eight-episode techno-thriller debuting Thursday on Hulu's
new FX hub.

Whether in concert or interview, Todd Snider is wonderfully unfiltered.
With his penchant for pot and psychedelics, the self-proclaimed
troubadour has turned his agnostic hymns and stoner fables into his
bread and butter. He's a jam-band believer (“I like the culture; it's
very Taoist and free-spirited") and a one-time teenage runaway who
couch-surfed and hitchhiked his way to becoming a modern-day Utah Phillips.

Influenced by Woody Guthrie, Jerry Jeff Walker, and Ramblin' Jack Elliot
— and at one point, a little too much Hunter S. Thompson, he admits —
the *Gen X* folkie has grown into one of those artists with such a
distinct flavor that you can watch a video like “Talking Reality
Television Blues" and chuckle aloud: The formula itself is a nod to
Guthrie, but the song is so Snider. That single off of 2019′s “Cash
Cabin Sessions, Vol. 3," was recorded at the Cash Cabin Studio, owned
and operated by John Carter Cash, Johnny's son.

Friends and family are seen as the most trustworthy source of advice and
broadly as competent as financial planners and banks.
