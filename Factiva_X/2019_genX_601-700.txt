As a young adult living in the generation of technology, I've always
been expected to know clever ways to express myself. Assumptions are as
high as Mt. Everest because they think, how is it possible for me to not
know how to reconfigure our internet connection when I could simply
Google and have answers right at my fingertips? I roll my eyes real hard
whenever I get remarks about how lucky I am to have been born in an age
where I don't need to improvise and dictate my news report through a
payphone at the corner of Ermita.

They are confident, carefree and spend more than $7,000 a year on luxury
goods before they turn 21.

Meet China's Generation Z. Spoiled by parents and grandparents for being
the only child in their families, these youngsters are living it up
compared to their cautious, conservative peers in the West, according to
a new survey.

Cory Booker is running for president. That makes nine announced
candidates for the Democratic primary, and if you add everyone The Times
lists from likely to ''might,'' you're up to 22.

When you throw in the Democrats who say they're ''thinking,'' we're way
past two dozen. You're a concerned citizen -- when you go to parties,
people are going to ask you who you like for the nomination. How are you
supposed to maintain your credibility?

[Generation Z]

The Pew Research Center, a nonprofit group that specializes in measuring
public opinion across demographic groups, recently announced that it had
settled on what to call the "post-millennial" generation born from about
1997 to 2012. Taking its cue from popular usage, Pew will apply the
label "Generation Z," or "Gen Z" for short.

Shoppers' food preferences and priorities can vary greatly across store
departments and consumer backgrounds, from organic to grass-fed and
vegan. But if there's one attribute that often transcends food types and
shopper demographics, it's "local."

Consumers now more than ever want to know how, by whom and where their
food was made. They seek the story behind both the brand and the
product, and they're increasingly cognizant of supporting their local
economies, particularly when it comes to fresh food. According to a
recent survey by New York-based market research firm Nielsen, 85% of
consumers are conscious of locally grown produce, with awareness highest
among the greatest generation, baby boomers and *Gen X*.

Economic growth combined with regulatory, technological and demographic
change should keep demand high for legal talent

WITH nearly all sectors of the general business community that stimulate
legal practice areas experiencing growth, Kentucky's major law firms
expect 2019 to continue the strong demand and revenue growth they saw in
2018. There is ongoing demand for experienced legal talent. However, law
firms, like many of their clients, are going through a generational
transformation as the post-war baby boomer generation retires and there
is increased competition for top law school graduates as well as
recruitment of attorneys with experience.

Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) is revamping its digital platforms to serve
the nation's Spanish-speaking community.

U.S. banks competing for new customer deposits are eyeing the Hispanic
population, the largest minority group in the country. At nearly 59
million, the U.S. Hispanic population constitutes 18.1 percent of the
country's population – and it's only expected to grow. Approximately 41
million Hispanic-Americans are native Spanish speakers and another 11
million are bilingual, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

'Value for money spent' remains an important consideration for US
consumers when choosing where to do their grocery shopping as 73% of
shoppers refer to one or more advertising/sales vehicles – traditional,
social, mobile and digital – before or during the shopping trip, the
Retail Feedback Group (RFG) revealed in its 2019 US Supermarket
Experience Study.

According to the RFG annual study (which surveyed 1,200 shoppers), while
the majority of respondents said they are on the lookout for sales and
promotions, many are not satisfied with the 'value for money spent' at
traditional supermarkets.

With boomers retiring and leadership requirements changing, the industry
could face a leadership gap if it fails to develop its internal talent,
especially *Gen X*.

Of the 50 chief executive officer searches The Jacobson Group has done

Carriers get creative to keep employees happy.

With the U.S. unemployment rate dropping to a 49-year low of 3.7% in
2018—and insurance industry unemployment dropping to a 10-year low of
1.2%—it’s tougher than ever to hang on to top employees.

From the Editor’s Desk: Insurers seek leadership talent in *Generation
X*, ready or not. The February issue also includes a look at the opioid
epidemic and its impact on the life insurance industry.

As the next generation of insurance leaders steps into the top roles in
their organizations, they face a variety of challenges, including the
need to understand and implement new technology and meet changing
customer expectations.

My friend and I went clubbing to see if we still “had it going on”.

My friends and I belong to a lost group of people who came of age in the
year 2000. We are not accurately labelled in sociological terms, and
we’re a bit self-conscious about it. We fell down the crack between the
hairy buttock of *Generation X* and the smooth and twitchy cheek of the
millennials. We had the internet, but we went to EasyEverything cafes to
get it. We listened to OutKast and All Saints, and we worshipped Eminem
– we still prefer to separate his mad rap skills from his unsavoury
opinions.

There was already talk in literary circles about David Foster Wallace's
novel Infinite Jest before it was even published. Was it really more
than 1,500 pages long? Was it going to be the era-defining work of a
not-even-34year-old genius (as some claimed it would be)? Wallace's
publisher, Little, Brown, stoked the hype by sending postcards to
publications with phrases such as “Infinite Pleasure" and “Infinite
Writer." The novel – trimmed down to slightly fewer than 1,100 pages –
was about society's addiction to entertainment, among so many other
things, and it made Wallace, pictured above, the literary celebrity for
*Generation X*. David Lipsky, a Rolling Stone reporter, followed him on
the book tour – it was the first time the music magazine had planned to
profile an author in a decade. (The profile would never run, but the
reporter would turn his conversations with Wallace into a book, which
would become the 2015 movie The End of the Tour).

Each week, a breakout star seems to emerge from outstanding
fly-on-theward-wall series Hospital (BBC Two) and the instalment filmed
at Liverpool's Alder Hey Children's Hospital was no exception.

Paediatric heart surgeon Dr Ramana Dhannapuneni - "Ram the Man" to
colleagues - took top billing thanks to his precision, candid bedside
manner and tireless work ethic. "I don't think he sleeps," said a nurse.
"He'd operate 24 hours a day if he could." His family rarely see him, Dr
Ram admitted, because "I'm invested in helping other people".

The hardest-working man in America is the DJ at a midsize Philadelphia
concert venue called District N9NE. It's the Saturday after
Thanksgiving, and it has been an agonizing three hours since the doors
opened. This poor DJ is trying his hardest to distract hundreds of
fans—none of whom appear to be over the age of 22—from the glaring
absence of Juice WRLD, the year's newly minted hip-hop superstar.
They've come to see their digital hero in the flesh, but excitement has
curdled into restlessness, and after restlessness comes agitation. So
many Juuls have died that some fans have resorted to lighting up real
cigarettes inside the venue. For a moment, the DJ is able to pacify the
crowd by playing “GUMMO,” the viral New York street-rap anthem from the
then newly incarcerated Tekashi 6ix9ine, but the crowd's fury prevails.
“Juice WRLD will be here in five minutes,” the DJ announces in a tone
that's not exactly convincing.

Rejected by 35 publishers, “Home Land," Sam Lipsyte's second novel,
revealed the writer as the reigning king of riff. Told in a series of
chipper and increasingly demented missives to an alumni newsletter from
a ne'er-do-well known as Teabag, the 2004 novel stands as a poisonously
uproarious monument to the disappointments and soul-chafing alienation
of early adulthood. It presented a tauter, deadlier distillation of the
jagged and oftentimes brilliant voice Lipsyte had introduced in his
earlier novel and stories, one now being compared, favorably, to that of
Phillip Roth.

PAULA NEWTON, ANCHOR, CNN: All right, so it doesn't look like a great
day, but you know what you don't see there, the tech rally. We will get
to that. There is a lot going on today and this is what's moving markets
on Thursday, the 31st of January.

You thought scandals could hurt Facebook. Yeah, right. Their shares are
soaring and profits have never been better. Not to be outdone, GE.
Shares are up even more after the company's signs of a turnaround there
are finally under way. And we've got China, trade talks in the Oval
Office any minute now. Yes, I told you. A busy hour ahead. I'm Paula
Newton and this is "Quest Means Business."

One has to wonder what Lena Dunham (the creator of
Girls[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2017/01/21/lena-dunham-girls-has-life-identity/]
) and long-time writing partner Jenni Konner were thinking when they
decided to adapt Julia Davis’s Camping (Sky Atlantic) for US television.

Consumers want retailers to track them, but not necessarily in the way
retailers expect.

According to “Utilizing Communication Channels in Retail,” a survey of
5,000 consumers ages 15-54 from retail technology provider Fluent
Commerce, 58% do not think it is helpful for retailers to track their
location. However, 85% of respondents want retailers to recognize and
pick up on their shopping habits to send them relevant incentives and
coupons. Another 71% would be enticed to shop in-store if retailers
recognized they were browsing online and sent them coupons to a nearby
location.

It’s a weekend night and I have two dinner invites. But instead of going
I’m staying in.

I’ve got big plans. I’m thinking a home-cooked meal, maybe a good bottle
of red, a film, or maybe a board game with my boyfriend. Certainly
nothing that will involve leaving the house, engaging with strangers or
shouting over loud music. This is now what I look forward to. I fact,
staying in is my definition of luxury.

*HD* 	Rotterdam Film Review: ‘Beats’; The fading Nineties rave scene
provides a luminous backdrop to Brian Welsh's bittersweet,
black-and-white coming-of-age tale.

A snappy, scrappy, straining-at-the-leash coming-of-ager from bleakest
Scotland, Brian Welsh’s “Beats” takes place in 1994 — two years before
the release of “Trainspotting,” though 23 years on, it feels like
something of an heir to Danny Boyle’s Nineties yardstick. The same
spirit of raggedly exuberant, techno-pumped nihilism courses through
both films. It’s something of a jolt, then, to realize that while
Boyle’s film was an of-the-moment youth revolt, “Beats” is an
alternately wistful and furious period piece — looking back at an
unstable, exciting era of Cool Britannia and incipient cultural
liberation that stalled somewhere along the way to Brexit Britain.
That’s the subtext, at least: the surface is a rollicking buddy movie,
both funny and stomach-churning as it follows two gawky 15-year-old lads
seeking a debauched sendoff to childhood.

* In this op-ed, Jason Smith of Mindshare argues that marketers'
preoccupation with brand safety and other traditional guideposts may
come at the expense of reaching consumers.

* He says advertising as we know it is on the wane as people spend more
time with media such as HBO and Netflix that lack traditional ads.

Dogfish Head Craft Brewery, known for beers made with exotic ingredients
that often boast high alcohol levels, is on a health kick.

The Milton, Delaware-based brewer will soon release Slightly Mighty IPA,
a low-alcohol ale (4 percent ABV) with only 95 calories and 3.6 grams of
carbohydrates, a profile rivaling that of post-workout favorite Michelob
Ultra (95 calories, 2.6 grams of carbs).

A survey has indicated that more than half of Australians do not
consider private health insurance as essential.

The survey has shown that the number of people who consider private
health insurance as essential has dropped over the past five years. More
people have also agreed that terms mentioned in insurance policies are
difficult to understand.

Australians with private health insurance continue to question its
value, with the cost of the product and confusion over coverage driving
sentiment, new research shows.

Norman Morris, industry communications director at Roy Morgan, said the
attitudes of private health fund members had tracked an adverse trend
over recent years.

Deep below the surface of the Australian people there are powerful
tectonic forces that can shift consumer and property markets. These
forces might stem from the 1960s and earlier, but they are surfacing
this decade and will continue into the next.

We all understand the baby boom and its effect on the school-age market
in the 1970s, on household formation in the 1980s, and on the demand for
sea-change property in the 2000s.

Kamala Harris has made one thing clear with her entry into the

It's not just the huge kick-off crowd, the big early money. It's the
self-assured toughness.

Data, it seems, is one reason investors like direct-to-consumer brands.

Speaking on an HSBC panel in New York City Wednesday, investors who
spoke at an HSBC panel cited data as one reason why they like to invest
in direct-to-consumer brands. The panel spoke on “Direct-to-Consumer
Investment Strategy: Funding the Industry’s Next Big Thing.”
Participants included: Lisa Myers of L Catterton; Anthony Choe of
Provenance and Chris Carey of Stripes Group. Geoff Headington, head of
global ventures at HSBC, moderated the panel.

Are millennials genuinely so different from previous generations?
Katherine Davidson takes a closer look at the results of new research
challenging that widely held view

Last month I was invited to present at a conference in Berlin, for which
I spent a couple of days preparing and then got up at 4am to fly over
and attend. The speaker before me confidently told the audience that
millennials lacked their elders' work ethic so would drag down
productivity and GDP growth. As I took to the stage, I rather wondered
why I bothered …

As technology transforms how individuals manage money, writes Simon
Binney, the advice sector as a whole will face a more discerning and
demanding client base, which will have quality and convenience front-of-mind

The choice of a financial adviser can be based on a myriad of reasons -
a recommendation, a review, the possibility of online advice, perhaps an
inheritance or windfall. What should be at the heart of any decision to
select an adviser, however, is quality, regulated advice.

demand slows.

The symposium, in its 25th year, attracted 14,000 attendees from around
the world to the Sacramento Convention Center this week to talk about
topics ranging from international bulk wine sales to competitive pressures.

The time on the symbolic Doomsday Clock remains at two minutes to
midnight, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists announced last Thursday.
Though the clock has not moved in a year, Rachel Bronson, president and
CEO of the organization, says that's far from a good sign. "We have in
fact entered a period that we call the new abnormal," Bronson said.
"This new abnormal that the world now inhabits is unsustainable and
unsettling. We appear to be normalizing a very dangerous world."

The Doomsday Clock was created in 1947 by atomic scientists who had
worked on the Manhattan Project. It symbolizes how close we are to
man-made global catastrophe. The original setting of the clock was seven
minutes to midnight, with midnight signifying the end. With the vivid
spectre of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the threat of nuclear annihilation
worried us all. But we got used to it. Other, more palpable threats -
the environment, the economy - overtook the fear of nuclear winter.

Millennials, it seems, are killing yet another industry. Considering the
new “victim” is the funeral home market, one can’t help but wonder if
that’s not a positive change. Still, there’s a lot more to this sped-up
“death” than meets the eye, especially if you look at how powerful the
funeral lobby has been in the past.

The traditional death industry has seen its profits dwindle in the last
few decades. But the first sign people were just not that into fancy
burials came in 2015, when cremation surpassed traditional burial rates
across the country. Then, cremation reached the 49 percent rate
nationwide while the burial-rate estimate was just 45 percent.

When it comes to the customer experience, supermarkets lead discount
grocery competitors Aldi and Walmart but trail in perception of value
for the money, according to Retail Feedback Group (RFG).

In the consumer research firm’s 2019 U.S. Supermarket Experience Study,
based on a national sample of 1,200 grocery shoppers, supermarkets had
the strongest overall satisfaction, with a score of 4.31 on a 5-point
scale. That was just above Aldi at 4.27 but well ahead of Walmart at 3.93.

Kamala Harris has made one thing clear with her entry into the
presidential race: She is a Democratic force to be reckoned with.

It's not just the huge kick-off crowd, the big early money. It's the
self-assured toughness.

The digital revolution, climate change, generational handover and a
fractious geopolitical landscape threaten to overturn typical
assumptions underpinning aerospace strategy

We know what has already happened in, say, the past decade – or at least
we think we do. What’s coming in the future – the next decade, for
example – we obviously can’t know. But to make best guesses is human
nature, not to mention the underpinnings of corporate management and the
consultancy industry. How we make those best guesses, though, is
guesswork. Armed with data and experience, we tend to extrapolate and
describe a future that – comfortingly – is very much like the past.

Twitch is a massive global live streaming platform and is quickly
becoming one of the most effective influencer marketing platforms. Live
streaming is the amalgamation of TV, digital, social, influencer and
podcast marketing, providing marketers with a dizzying array of options.

There are two unique benefits of working with streamers on Twitch that
provide more impact and response than other social influencer campaigns.
To start, they offer brands access to hours of viewers’ attention.
Streaming sessions are typically between two and five hours long, with
the average viewer watching for 20–60 minutes at a time several times a
week. Sponsor activations on Twitch enable a high share of voice and
hours of attention with tastefully integrated messaging and a persistent
call to action. The second unique benefit is the interactive nature of
the platform and real-time engagement via chat, which is often as
engaging as the stream itself.

Companies need to take care of the causes and people they publicly support.

That’s according to a survey by CompreCards in which 53% of respondents
said they would no longer shop at their favorite retailer if it publicly
supported a person or cause they strongly disagreed with. According to
the survey, in the past year, 35% of *Generation X* and 33% of
millennials have boycotted a company or product they had spent money on
in the past. Thirty percent of *Gen X* and 26% of millennials are
currently boycotting.

Editor's note: Gabriel Cecchini is a consultant in corporate governance,
Integridad & ESG. The opinions expressed in this column belong
exclusively to the author. (Expansion) - "The fight against climate
change is a moral obligation", "the leaders of the United States must
honor our fundamental values by explicitly rejecting expressions of
hatred and racism", "we believe that privacy is a right fundamental
human. It does not matter in which country one lives, this right must be
protected. " Until recently, these phrases have led us to think
exclusively of political leaders or activists of civil society; however,
they were made in 2018 by Unilever CEOs Paul Polman, who recently left
office; from Merck, Kenneth Frazier; and Apple, Tim Cook, respectively.
The previous sentences have become an increasingly frequent phenomenon
in a crisis of global leadership.

JAKARTA (THE JAKARTA POST/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - Making up nearly half of
the electorate, Indonesia's millennials are at the top of every
political party's target group list for this year's election.

But the younger generation's general disinterest in politics, coupled
with a decreasing turnout rate, raises the question of whether
candidates and political parties will be able to get millennials to
exercise their right to vote at all come election day in April.

The reported preference of millennials and generation Z for sustainable
investment comes as no surprise. Born between 1980 and 2010, these
people are inheriting a world of biodiversity loss, climate change and
plastic infestation.

A recent survey by First State Investments found that more than 80 per
cent of millennials are interested or very interested in sustainable, or
responsible investing (SRI), where fund managers take account of
environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria when picking stocks
or tracking an index.

As more states move towards legalizing cannabis, it only makes sense
that more people tried the drug in 2018 compared to the previous year—
in fact, first-time usage was up 140 percent—according to a new report
from
Eaze,[https://www.eaze.com/article/insights-2018-state-of-cannabis-report-marijuana-consumer-diversify]
a cannabis marketplace in California.

The report, which looked at cannabis consumption behavior of Gen Zers,
millennials, Gen Xers and baby boomers, outlines major trends among
these four different generations of consumers.

It’s over. After 12 years of daily contact, I am finished with Facebook.
It's not easy. We had a long, meaningful connection — my avatar had more
than 1,200 virtual friends from every stage of my life.

Thousands of tiny takes and status updates from two-dimensional
acquaintances had nearly replaced physical, personal contact. And those
digital updates, links and images carried surprising emotional value.
For instance, though my mother died four years ago at 90, I’ve still
wished her happy birthday each year on her dormant Facebook page.

He ended 2018 on a high note, when he became a naturalised citizen of
the US after decades of living in California.

And Billy Idol, 63, continued to celebrate another milestone on Saturday
night, when he took to the stage at the Palms Casino Resort's Palm
Theater in Las Vegas for his new residency show.

Pete Buttigieg’s notion of “intergenerational justice” — the subject of
one of my newsletters last
week[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/opinion/pete-buttigieg-2020-election.html]
— sent me on a data hunt. I dug into the numbers on income, wealth and
other issues to see how millennials, baby boomers, my own *Generation X*
and others are faring.

Every year more millennials enter the workforce, which has the
opportunity to take advantage of the characteristics that distinguish
this generation. This is indicated by Beatriz Rivas, vice president of
corporate affairs of Great Place to Work, who locates herself in
*generation X* and defines millennials based on their differences with
age groups. "The way of thinking and the mental processes of millennials
allow them to connect things that perhaps it was difficult for other
generations to connect with, this ability to connect different
information points allows them to go further, to apply technical
knowledge," says Rivas. The expert points out that, within the same
generation, there are subgroups: the senior millennial, the millennial
middle age and the junior millennial. However, despite the distinctions
of age and goals, they share several characteristics.

After Loveyatri, Aayush Sharma has started working on his next offering.
The *Gen-X* star's new beefed-up and rugged look has got everyone
wondering about his sudden transformation. It's learnt that the actor,
who gained up to approximately 10-12 kgs for his role in his next
project, is being appreciated for his striking good look by the audience
and fans.

Interestingly, sources suggest that the actor has roped in Tiger
Shroff's fitness trainer Vikram Swain to supervise his physical
transformation.

The way an employee feels about their organisation’s learning and
development opportunities is the biggest predictor of retention,
according to employee feedback data captured across a wide range of
industries.

It just pips leadership as the most important, but those two factors are
definitely the key, says chief scientist of Culture Amp, Jason McPherson.

The subtitle of Tom Cruise's last "Mission: Impossible" movie,
"Fallout," could also describe the current state of Scientology.

The church, which still maintains a flock of A-list adherents including
Cruise, John Travolta and Kirstie Alley, is at a cross-roads. Hollywood
members, who for decades brought in mega-star wattage as well as
mega-bucks, are aging, and yet there's no new lifeblood coming through
the ranks. When was the last time you heard of a famous Scientologist
under 36 years old?

Separating reality from myth is the purpose of a study by the Federal
Reserve of the United States that examines what is true in certain
popular topics between media and analysts related to the millennial
generation. The commonplaces as "millennials: the new luxury is to live,
rather than to have" they pass to examination. The result? Millennials
have the same consumption patterns as previous generations, but less wealth.

And even more: as millennials mature, their consumption equals that of
previous generations.

This column has been submitted in response to the StarMetro Halifax
article[https://www.thestar.com/halifax/2019/01/16/automation-could-help-fill-the-void-left-by-nova-scotias-retiring-boomers-report-suggests.html]
“Automation could help fill the void left by Nova Scotia's retiring
boomers, report suggests” published Jan. 16, 2019.

HALIFAX — A recent report looking at the gap retiring boomers will leave
in the workplace says that automation could go a long way toward filling
that expanding labour shortage. The larger question, however, is what
else can be done to tackle the issue — now and going forward. Somewhat
ironically, boomers themselves appear to be a crucial part of the answer.

Never once at the start of my workweek -- not in my morning coffee shop
line; not in my crowded subway commute; not as I begin my bottomless
inbox slog -- have I paused, looked to the heavens and whispered:
#ThankGodIt'sMonday.

Apparently, that makes me a traitor to my generation. I learned this
during a series of recent visits to WeWork locations in New York, where
the throw pillows implore busy tenants to ''Do what you love.'' Neon
signs demand they ''Hustle harder,'' and murals spread the gospel of
T.G.I.M. Even the cucumbers in WeWork's water coolers have an agenda.
''Don't stop when you're tired,'' someone recently carved into the
floating vegetables' flesh. ''Stop when you are done.'' Kool-Aid
drinking metaphors are rarely this literal.

The Silent Generation, Baby Boomers, *Gen X*, Y, Z, and Millennials, all

The rich are getting richer and younger. A study with US investors with
$ 25 million or more has found that the average age of these investors
has declined 11 years since 2014 to 47. These incredibly wealthy
Americans, whose numbers have more than doubled since the depths of the
Great Recession, are younger than less wealthy millionaires. The average
age of those who have at least a mere million dollars is 62, a number
that has not changed for years.

This conclusion suggests that a "broad generational transfer of wealth"
is "just beginning," said George Walper Jr., president of the Spectrem
Group, which carried out the study. The sample size was small - 185
Americans with more than 25 million dollars in net worth - but the
results match other economic surveys on the richest 0.1%.

Nobody has moral qualms about Gillian Anderson playing Margaret
Thatcher. Fans of stuff are stupid, but they are rarely that stupid. At
least two articles have, nonetheless, engaged with an imagined backlash
at the news that the Anglo-American actor is to take on the role of the
Lincolnshire Milk Thief in the fourth series of The Crown. "You can
still like Gillian Anderson, even if she makes a great Thatcher," the
Guardian tells us. Everyone knows that.

We asked several experts to consider how the future of aviation might be
shaped by huge forces transforming the world today

We know what has already happened, say, in the past decade – or at least
we think we do. What’s coming in the future – the next decade, for
example – we obviously can’t know. But to make best guesses is human
nature, not to mention the underpinnings of corporate management and the
consultancy industry. How we make those best guesses, though, is fraught
with uncertainty. Armed with data and experience of the past, we tend to
extrapolate and typically describe a future that – comfortingly – is
very much like the past.
