Generation Z adults are slightly less likely than older Americans to
trust brands, and are comparable to *Generation X* in showing a
pronounced distrust of corporate America, according to a
multigenerational study by Morning
Consult[https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.mediapost.com/uploads/Morning_Consult_The_State_of_Consumer_Trust.pdf].
The researcher asked for consumer opinions about 100 major brands.

Twelve percent of U.S. adults ages 18 to 22, the first cohort of
Generation Z to reach adulthood, said they don't trust the average brand
to varying degrees. They show a greater distrust of corporate America,
with 58% saying expressing some level of distrust. Young adults tend to
put more emphasis on ethical matters, like how well companies treat
their employees.

Two of my children have just declared they want to become vegans. Our
eight-year-old and 16-year-old daughters want to save the environment,
which I’m all for, obviously, except I’m not really sure what to feed
them while they are doing it. In desperation I have turned to YouTube
for tips and, after watching many “Vegan teens: what I eat all day”
videos, my head is now full of purple and orange vegetables, peanut
snacks called Lärabars and anxiety-inducing images of slothlike
adolescents leaving the lids off smoothie makers. I’m also haunted by
the question of whether almond milk might be causing the death of
millions of honeybees. It’s all so confusing for a *generation X* parent
who isn’t an adventurous cook.

The youngest of my four has been swayed by reports about Veganuary on
CBBC’s Newsround. And No 3 was a veggie, but we didn’t quite get it
right and she was prescribed iron tablets.

Technology moves so fast, doesn't it? Especially where it concerns
communication, something we all use every day.

I feel like my own *generation (X*, if you're wondering) has pretty much
given up on email, outside of work, whereas those younger never even got
started on it.

Are you at ease with physical contact, or does the idea of brushing arms
with a stranger/friend/relative bring you out in a cold sweat?

A new study, launched this week, will look into how we answer those
questions[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2020/01/21/do-like-touched-bbc-launches-biggest-ever-study-find-wake-metoo/].
Goldsmiths, University of London, has teamed up with the BBC to ask
people how they feel about touching others, how much they need touch,
and how comfortable they are with it. Researchers will drill down into
the answers to see whether people of varying nationalities, cultures,
ages, disabilities, sexualities, and genders feel differently.

"I hate being bipolar. It's wonderful." This is the legend that
decorated the cover of Ye, the album released in 2018 by the rapper,
entrepreneur and self-proclaimed demigod, Kanye West. Days before the
album's release, its author was being medianed and confirming that he
had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Rap, a style hitherto
virtually refractory to dealing with mental health issues, was
introduced into a new universe, a paradigm in which its figures spoke
openly about their head problems and were fragile and vulnerable.
Kendrick Lamar confessed to suffering from Survivor Syndrome, a kind of
guilt complex, every time he visited his Los Angeles neighborhood,
Compton, and checked how the living conditions of his friends and
neighbors remained just as harsh, while he he amassed gold records and
even a Pulitzer Prize. He even claimed to have thought of killing
himself during the recording of his album To pimp a butterfly (2015).

There's a scintillating insight buried in Deloitte's new "Human
Experience[https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/347229/price-vs-experience-here-are-some-multiples-fo.html]"
report that should get the attention of brand marketers and agencies
looking for opportunities in American lifestyle changes.

The report, which focuses mostly on the relative value of brand
experiences, also identifies an "increase in free time," or at the very
least, a perceived increase in the free time available to American adults.

If you haven’t heard of PUBG, you are obviously living under a rock. The
multiplayer first person shooter game is after all the big rage in the
gaming circles. While video games mostly get a bad rap, some for good
reasons, it’s now bringing in a new millennial trend in to the office –
rage-quitting. FYI, rage-quitting is a gaming terminology that is a
condition in which gamers, who, through steady provoking and not being
able to handle losing, leave mid-match. It is categorised by violent
behaviour like throwing away the controller, punching seats, yelling and
cussing. In the workplace, rage-quitting is quitting without notice out
of pure anger.QUIT IN STYLE?It has also become the fodder for viral
videos. For instance, former flight attendant Steven Slater cursed out a
rude passenger over the PA system, grabbed two beers, deployed the
evacuation slide and slid down the chute.

Hulu's 'High Fidelity' is for people who love to watch a square peg get
painfully hammered into a round hole. The sound of a needle scratching
across an entire side of a beloved vintage LP also comes to mind.

It's a 10-episode dramedy series (streaming Friday) that's based on Nick
Hornby's well-received 1995 novel about the lovesick pangs of a
resolutely dyspeptic London record-shop owner trying to get over his
ex-girlfriend. John Cusack, one of *Generation X*'s preeminent hangdog
crushes, starred in the enjoyable 2000 film adaptation, which relocated
the story to Chicago, introduced the moviegoing public to Jack Black (as
a hyperactive clerk) and turned out to be a fitting ode to a particular
strain of music geekdom that was already marked for extinction. The
story, which was also made into a stage musical, was only ostensibly
about how men and women navigate relationships in their early 30s;
mostly it was about how much some people loved record stores.

Dhaka, Jan. 24 -- Some are fascinated with her: they see her as a hero,
as a Joan of Arc of modern times or as a Mafalda, with a political
agenda to preserve planet Earth and as such, represents the younger
generations as more intelligent than that of their parents. Others are
angry: they see her as a naive puppet of opaque adult interests and they
make fun of her.

Young ecologist, Greta Thunberg became a new global figure and depending
on the political point of view of observers, she is either defended or
hated. On September 20, 2019 the #FridaysforFuture movement, inspired
and encouraged by the Swedish teenager, celebrated its largest mass
mobilisation. In almost every country in the world, young people and
adults took to the streets. It is estimated that about 4 million people
mobilised around the world.

2020 FEB 17 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at
Journal of Engineering -- Investigators publish new report on
Information Technology - Cloud Computing. According to news reporting
originating from Zaragoza, Spain, by VerticalNews correspondents,
research stated, "This study provides new evidence on the differences
between generational cohorts in terms of the effects of
technology-related attributes and previous negative privacy and security
experiences on users' propensity to pay for cloud services. Previous
negative privacy and security experiences have been examined as a source
of different protection behaviors, but little is known about their
effect on payment for a premium version of the product or service."

Financial supporters for this research include MINECO, Government of
Aragon, European Social Fund (GENERES Group).

In the current turbulent global political climate, a job or a career for
life for those just starting out in the workplace is no longer
guaranteed — or even desirable. Add in the climate crisis and wider
anxiety about the future, and the feeling of worry and lack of control
could potentially become overwhelming.

SEOUL, Feb. 6 (Yonhap) -- Less than half of young Americans, known as
millennials, favor the use of military force if North Korea invaded the
U.S. ally of South Korea, a survey showed Tuesday.

The Chicago Council on Global Affairs conducted the online survey from
June 7-20 on 2,059 adults and found that only 49 percent of millennials,
those born from 1981 to 1996, were in favor of deploying U.S. troops if
North Korea invades the South.

How much retirement savings will you need for a comfortable life once
you retire? And how do you reach that goal if you're not already on track?

Lots of people never try to figure out the
answer[https://news.northwesternmutual.com/planning-and-progress-2019]
to the first question because they're afraid the number will be too big.
It would scare them. It would make them give up trying to save enough.

1. MINI-CRUISES No, not bath-tub-sized ships. In 2020, we expect to see
more passengers opt for short, two-to-five day trip durations as holiday
trends change. 'Micro-travel', as it's increasingly termed, not only
fits busy schedules better than traditional seven-plus day itineraries;
it also allows first-timers a taste of cruising without a big-time
commitment. Combined with a short flight (to Southampton or Barcelona,
say), it could be the perfect excuse to give cruising a try...

2. YOUNG BLOOD Forget stereotypes of the newly-wed, over-fed and nearly
dead. Attitudes to cruise holidays are changing, according to research
by the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), which says Irish
passenger numbers grew 20pc in 2019. "More than 66pc of *Generation X*
and 71pc of millennials have a more positive attitude to cruising than
two years ago," it adds.

"The Virtuous Midlife
Crisis,"[https://proxylibrary.hse.ru:2346/articles/the-virtuous-midlife-crisis-11578830400]
a Wall Street Journal article about how today's 40- and 50-somethings
are skipping the stereotypical sports car and Vegas weekend and pushing
headlong into fitness and mindfulness instead, led readers to recount
their own midlife reinventions.

Readers wrote about career changes, finding purpose by serving others
and learning to feel grateful for what they have. There was spirited
debate, too: A few said they'd still take the sports car. Here are
edited excerpts of some of their comments.

WASHINGTON – With more than $58,000 in student loan debt from Northern
Arizona University and a full-time job that barely got her from paycheck
to paycheck, Kaitlin Kump never thought she would be able to buy a home
in her 20s.

Kump buckled down, working three or four jobs at a time and living in
her grandfather’s spare bedroom rent-free for several months until she
had finally saved enough money to buy her very own condo.

A couple of weeks ago, one of my teenage daughters casually mentioned
that she had created a TikTok - a short video on the platform owned by
ByteDance, the Chinese company - that had gained 114,000 views in a
matter ofdays.

"A hundred and fourteen thousand?" I repeated, wondering if I hadmisheard.

Today's young adults are starting their lives on drastically different
financial footing than their parents did decades ago. Necessities cost
far more and wages have flattened; as a result, many young families have
to dig through mountains of debt before they can even think about
growing their wealth.

A data point from the Federal Reserve, highlighted recently in a special
report on housing by the Economist, underscores the differences between
millennials' financial trajectory and those of earlier generations: In
1990, baby boomers, whose median age was 35, owned nearly one-third of
American real estate by value.

Finding women, mid-career and low-income employees are the most at-risk,
Greenspring Advisors suggests ways plan sponsors, providers and advisers
should enhance the support and resources they offer.

A survey by Greenspring Advisors conducted during May 2019, with the aim
of providing a comprehensive, multi-dimensional assessment of employee
perceptions about their financial well-being, found mid-career employees
(ages 35 to 55) are in the toughest position.

How can we adapt to the stage a literature as absolutely torrential,
intimate, disgressive and feverish as that of David Foster Wallace? This
challenge is faced by the Argentine Juan Navarro in At the Top Forever
in the Teatre Lliure in Barcelona, a triptych starring Gonzalo Cunill,
Gemma Polo and Rodolfo Castagnolo and based on Short Interviews with
Repulsive Men.

Navarro himself acknowledges that DFW's literature is "atypical, poetic
and untheatrical", but his enthusiasm for the American author, who
committed suicide in 2008 becoming a myth for several generations of
readers, could give him more. "I have always been attracted to him that
being such a fragile author is so powerfully exposed. I had difficulty
getting into reality and that's why I turned it into fiction. He was,
above all, a humanist who sought the honesty of experience. As Fresán
says, he was an experimental author who, in search of a code and style,
found a language of his own, the DFW language," he explains.

Give new Illinois Senate President Don Harmon (D-Oak Park) some credit.
He’s made a few very solid moves since Jan. 18, when he was elected to
his chamber’s top job.

Harmon won a majority vote of his caucus before the full Senate voted.
He had at least some support from just about every Democratic faction.
Kimberly Lightford is an African-American, but Harmon received several
votes from people of color. Downstaters voted for both candidates, as
did women.

HANOVER, N.H. (AP) — New Hampshire voters are poised Tuesday to re-order
the field of Democratic presidential candidates. But as important, they
will also send a message about what kind of change they want their party
to stand for to challenge President Donald Trump.

Will it be the call for revolutionary change offered by Sen. Bernie
Sanders of Vermont, a democratic socialist who wants to dramatically
re-engineer the U.S. economy, or the one for generational change by Pete
Buttigieg, who says his plans are rooted in realism?

*HD* 	It's not just older voters who are giving Joe Biden his lead with
black Americans

Conventional wisdom has emerged that former vice president Joe Biden's
lead with black voters is due in large part to older black voters who
are familiar with the former lawmaker.

Since Biden launched his campaign, multiple polls have regularly shown
that he is popular with black voters. But the photos of him campaigning,
particularly in states such as South Carolina, regularly show him
embracing older black women in churches or shaking hands with older
black men on the trail who are throwing their support behind the man who
was the number two for America's first black president.

From seasonal lattes to ethical coffee beans, this year it’s all about
maximising your hot drinks and tapping into a growing market

For centuries Brits have been renowned as habitual tea drinkers.
Morning, noon and evening – a cup of char was the linchpin of culture –
until now. In the past 10 years, the UK’s daily coffee consumption has
increased by 35%, from 70m cups a day to a staggering 95m – just 5m shy
of our daily tea intake.

The number of people applying to study medicine has increased by over
6%[https://www.gmc-uk.org/-/media/documents/the-state-of-medical-education-and-practice-in-the-uk---workforce-report_pdf-80449007.pdf]
in the last year, with many medical schools receiving over ten
applicants for every university place. And so you might think that the
UK’s future supply of doctors is in excellent health.

By Matias Ortegamortega@ambito.com.arOne trend that can no longer be
ignored by companies, and which is increasingly ingrained in the new
generations of work, is that young people expect much more from their
jobs than a good income and "make a career" within a company. The
importance for them between the balance of their professional and
personal life is an issue that has been talked about for a long time and
you can no longer look to the side, nor think of the employee as he was
decades ago.

Today’s young adults are starting their lives on drastically different
financial footing than their parents did decades ago. Necessities cost
far more and wages have flattened; as a result, many young families have
to dig through mountains of debt before they can even think about
growing their wealth.

A data point from the Federal Reserve, highlighted recently in a special
report on housing by the Economist, underscores the differences between
millennials’ financial trajectory and those of earlier generations: In
1990, baby boomers, whose median age was 35, owned nearly one-third of
American real estate by value.

Employees need to feel seen and appreciated, and managers can use tech
hacks that recognise employees as individuals.

DURING the days when I was running a recruitment business, the Chinese
New Year (CNY) period used to be the busiest, given the tendency among
employees to jump ship at this time.

NEW YORK, Jan. 23, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- 5W Public Relations, one of the
15 largest independently-owned PR firms in the U.S., has learned that
health and wellness ranks as the top category Millennial consumers are
most likely to save on, determined by their 2020 Consumer Culture
Report. In contrast, experiential purchases ranked first, with things
like electronics, beauty, personal care, shoes & accessories and snacks
falling in the middle.

"Our data shows that 68% of Millennials don't see the importance of
investing in their health early on," said 5WPR CEO and Founder, Ronn
Torossian. "Younger generations are attracted to instant gratification.
They want to spend their money on immediate experiences rather than
invest in their future."

When asked to pick the top three biggest issues confronting the nation -
out of a potential list of 19 - 41 per cent of participants in an online

their top three, up 10 percentage points since last month.

Spending others' money as if it were one's own isn't successful
politics. Yet notwithstanding Congress' current appetite for
trillion-dollar annual deficits, there are limits to federal
spending--especially on Amtrak, which labors perennially for but a
miniscule portion.

Presidents Reagan and both Bushes recommended zeroing-out Amtrak
funding, Presidents Clinton and Trump sought 23% cuts, and Amtrak
opponents in Congress are too numerous to list.

The Target Group Index (TGI) study of Kantar IBOPE Media, revealed that
only 19% of the total people interviewed attended the cinema in the last
30 days and 14% once every 2 or 3 months.

However, cinemas - compared to other activities such as going for a walk
or a meal - are among the top 10 activities that Chileans usually do. In
the case of young segments, going to the cinema is in the top 5 of
activities.

At a bar in the East Village in early December, Doug Potash, who has
white hair and a bit of a beer belly, takes the stage and does his best
Mick Jagger impression. Performing a cameo with a Stones cover band
called the Blushing Brides, Potash claps and points, pouts and shakes
his hips, spitting out the words: "Huh, shidoobee, shattered, shattered!"

Judging from the reaction of the crowd of 150 fellow Rolling Stones
freaks, captured on video, you'd think Mick himself had stormed the
stage. Sporting the famous red Stones tongue logo — on shirts, pants,
jackets and a few tattoos — the audience members sing, dance, clap,
laugh, shout and point back at him.

India, Jan. 13 -- My friend's octogenarian grandmother had recently come
from the pristine hills of the Himalayas to spend a few days in the
comforting plains of Chandigarh. The whole family rallied around her. A
car and a driver had specially been stationed for her.

Very soon she started missing her usual dose of physical activity, and
grew weary of the over-relaxed lifestyle of netizens. Everything was a
click of a button away. She hardly had to lift a finger and things were
done in a jiffy.

A couple of weeks ago, one of my teenage daughters casually mentioned
that she had created a TikTok - a short video on the platform owned by
ByteDance, the Chinese company - that had gained 114,000 views in a
matter of days.

"A hundred and fourteen thousand?" I repeated, wondering if I had misheard.

Is $6,933 the new goal for 22- to 37-year-olds?

A recent opinion column in the New York Times argued that the millennial
generation, contrary to popular reports, “gets a gold star for
retirement
preparedness[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/31/opinion/sunday/student-loans-retirement-millennials.html].”
This argument was based on comparing 401(k) holdings at ages 22-37 of
$6,933 for millennials to $3,970 for members of *Generation X*.

Bradley Corp. has released the findings of its latest handwashing
survey, conducted annually for more than a decade. According to the
organization, Americans' concerns about contracting the flu have grown
over time; 60% of respondents are extremely or quite concerned about
catching the flu this year, as compared to 32% who felt that way 4 years
ago. Among all age groups, Mil-lennials expressed the most concern about
getting sick, according to Bradley.

In addition, the survey found that in response to flu outbreaks,
Americans become more conscientious about handwashing when they are in
public spaces. Nearly 80% say they wash their hands more frequently,
more thoroughly or longer after using a public restroom. On the first
survey conducted in 2009, only 45% said they increased their hand
hygiene in response to virus outbreaks.

Online multi-carrier insurance brokerage, Ensurem, points out that as technology enthusiasts age and devices become ever more alluring, vision maintenance may emerge as an increasingly urgent concern for seniors. 
 

CLEARWATER, Fla., Jan. 27, 2020 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- A new study by the
University of Michigan's Kellogg Eye Center shows that 92 percent of
Medicare beneficiaries wear eyeglasses. Eyeglasses and contact lenses,
however, are not covered by Medicare, leaving the aging population on
their own to deal with the cost of vision correction.(1) "This fact says
Dave Rich, CEO of Ensurem LLC, means people need to be aware of their
options regarding vision care." Rich, whose company is an online
multi-carrier insurance brokerage, adds, "What we're seeing with
Medicare beneficiaries age 65 or older, in the future, we may see across
the entire society."

Comment

So we’re nearly halfway through January (I know! Already! Where is the
time going?). The decorations have come down; the council has at long
last relieved us of our overflowing wheelie bins and black bags, and
sad, wanton pine trees lie abandoned on pavements up and down the land,
evicted from the warm, cosy houses in which they were once the centre of
attention. Christmas festivities and new year’s revelry are, alas, but a
warm memory; it’s time to tighten our belt buckles, eat less and revert
to restraint.

News | The Opinion Matrix COMMENT FROM HOME AND ABROAD EXORBITANT
TUITION FEES

The Guardian The truth is that *Generation X* graduates got lucky, and
luck is never fair. We didn't have the gnawing anxiety I see in students
now, who can't afford to miss a single lecture; who spend their holidays
frantically chasing internships, because they want to get good enough
jobs to make it all worthwhile. Tuition fees haven't just shaped their
finances, they have shaped the way they live their daily lives. If I
could bring back one thing from the 1990s it wouldn't be free tuition
but meanstested maintenance grants to cover student living costs, so the
young people whose parents can't afford to subsidise them well into
their 20s don't feel forced to go straight out to work. (Gaby Hinsliff)

Before social media and the explosion of viewing options, the stars of
1970s and 1980s films and TV shows carried greater mystique and broader
recognition.

This meant actors like Donny Most (Ralph Malph on "Happy Days") and Didi
Conn (Frenchy on "Grease") became iconic to *Generation X* and baby
boomers alike. They may not have been headliners like Ron Howard or
Olivia Newton-John, but they were stars in their own right.

Lou McDonald and Sinn Fein.

"I just can't be in the same room with him. I don't want to be. There is
just something about him that I recoil from. He has his hand in too many

End of form. The more financial education, the greater the creation of
wealth and the greater the "business" component in investment
portfolios. The business component is investments in stocks (stocks). A
recent study on the portfolio composition of higher-net-worth
individuals in the US indicates that, once a net worth of $100 million
is reached, the stock market component accounts for approximately 50% of
the net worth. While the $100 million target is ambitious, the message
is blunt once again: stock investment has been and will continue to be
the best way to build assets.

BLACK HOLES could soon be simultaneously observable in both
gravitational waves and X-rays – revolutionising our understanding of
the most extreme entities of the universe.

University of Birmingham researchers have told astronomers “to buckle
up” for an exciting new period of black hole discovery. The announcement
follows the European Space Agency recently revealing its two major space
observatories of the 2030s will have their launches timed for
simultaneous use.

In 1988 a very young actress with features of an innocent woman or an
eternal girl, marveling at everyone in the film Beetlejuice. He was only
17 years old, but he's already showing his talent. He will be hit by
just a few films to become a favorite of directors and an Oscar nominee.
Just a few smiles will suffice for the cutest actors of the moment to
love her. They will serve you just a few changes of clothes to transform
into a style icon, but a minor theft will destroy - in part - your
career. She, one of the most talented actresses of her time, has an
American city name and an alternative musician's surname: Winona Ryder.

From a young age, Winona showed that she was an ordinary girl with
unusual characteristics. His mother was a video producer and called
herself a Buddhist. His father, a renowned publisher and bookseller,
declared himself an atheist. The daughter manifested herstay in honor of
her Holocaust-murdered relatives.

Love is in the air and Nigerian bank users have spoken. ‘Who is the love
of your life? Who is your crush? Your side boo? Your worst ex? Who will
you break up with?’ Here at Ciuci Consulting, our annual banking report
– What Retail Banking Customers Want for 2020 has started on a ‘love
note’ with the #BankLoveChallenge.

This challenge was conducted to discover the love-hate relationship
between Nigerians and their banks. The favourite banks of respondents
across all age groups were listed with the reasons why they melt their
hearts and fill their tummies with butterflies. The survey conducted by
Ciuci Consulting in partnership with The Guardian used a random sample
of 1,023 respondents across Nigeria. The results showed that the top 5
most loved banks are GTBank, Zenith Bank, Access bank, First Bank and UBA.

A new generation entering the labour market and shaking up old habits is
nothing unusual. But the fast pace of technological change, combined
with the number of generations working together at the same time (baby
boomers, *generation X*, millennials and generation Z) creates a new
situation.

The increase in life expectancy results in an ageing population and
longer working lives, especially with an increase in legal retirement
age in many countries. These two trends are reshaping the labour market
in different ways. Most significantly, it's no longer conceivable to
stop learning and developing skills at 20 or 25 years old. The massive
acceleration of technological progress and digitalization makes lifelong
learning and training imperative.

It's never too early to start thinking about saving for your retirement.
But if you're a part of *Generation X* or a young Baby Boomer, the need
to start putting away money for your Golden Years is more urgent.

Many financial advisers tell investors to move more of their money into
conservative, safe haven investments like bonds and money market
accounts as they get older.

The U.S. Postal Service, Amazon and Google are among the most-trusted
brands in America, although young adults showing greater suspicion
toward big companies, researcher Morning
Consult[https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.mediapost.com/uploads/Morning_Consult_The_State_of_Consumer_Trust.pdf]
found in consumer surveys. No brand was trusted by most Americans.

About two out of five (42%) adults said they trusted the USPS in a list
that mostly included consumer packaged goods brands like Hershey, Dove
and Tide, along with a few tech names such as Amazon, Google and PayPal.
The Weather Channel, Netflix and National Geographic were the most
trusted media brands.

Over the decades, as metropolitan cities in India were flooded with
migrants, the influx led to growing shortfalls in civic facilities. As
the number of residents rose every year, living conditions gradually
went from bad to worse. Conversely, property rates kept rising with each
passing year, making most people’s chances of owning their home a
distant dream. Metros such as Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai and
Bangalore, etc. all became progressively difficult to live in because of
overcrowding, chaotic traffic, soaring pollution, crumbling civic
facilities, etc.

High valuations don't always bring fame in the world of venture-backed
consumer unicorns.

San Francisco-based vaping business Juul Labs, for instance, is among
the most highly valued consumer unicorns, but its brand was known only
to about 36 percent of people surveyed for a report from McGuffin
Creative Group
Inc.,[https://www.mcguffincg.com/best-known-unicorn-brand-statistics/]
