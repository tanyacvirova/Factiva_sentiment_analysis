EVERY day the battle between the generations seems to rage harder than
ever. Baby boomers are demonised, millennials mocked, and poor old
*Generation X* is stuck in the middle.

But what sets the generations against each other? From Brexit to pop
culture, it seems the age gap means we just cannot agree about anything
anymore. Why? What is it that defines each generation? What makes them tick?

In 2013, Sheryl Sandberg (born in 1969, a member of *Generation X*)
published the best seller Lean In, which encouraged working women to ask
themselves: "What would you do if you weren't afraid?"

Yes, a global pandemic has become another generational division. The
headlines have targeted Generation Z and millennials for their inability
to stay home, punished boomers for not taking the threat to their health
more seriously, and celebrating *Generation X*'s talent for hanging out
and doing nothing.

It seems that some millennials and seniors have not been so concerned
about the risk of getting COVID-19: before and even at the beginning of
total quarantine, many young people continued to go to bars and
restaurants despite the need to social estrangement.

*Generation X* craves happy hours and yoga class as much as anyone but
insists it can recapture a time before all that

Is *Generation X* — the legion of latchkey kids for whom the waning Cold
War still forced futile school drills — better able to self-soothe under
the confines of a coronavirus quarantine than Gen Z, millennials and
baby boomers?

In her early 40s, Ada Calhoun found herself racked with doubt about past
and future decisions. Despite a long marriage and professional success
as a journalist and author of the book Wedding Toasts I'll Never Give,
she lay awake at night worrying about credit-card debt and evaporating
job opportunities. She had heavy periods and crying jags. There was a
sketchy mammogram and she was gaining weight. Her response to her image
on her smartphone, even after putting on makeup and changing filters:
"Still house of horrors."

"I knew I felt lousy, but I didn't yet fully understand why," she writes
in the introduction to her new book Why We Can't Sleep: Women's New
Midlife Crisis. As the title suggests, the book is her attempt to answer
that question.

Why are so many *Gen X* women suffering a midlife crisis? And why is it
different for them?

You come to this place, midlife. You don't know how you got here, but
suddenly you're staring 50 in the face. When you turn and look back down
the years, you glimpse the ghosts of other lives you might have led. All
your houses are haunted by the person you might have been.

*Generation X* - the so-called 'squeezed middle' - are facing a painful
retirement without adequate pension provision, guaranteed inheritances
or independent financial advice.

A study among people aged 39 to 54, carried out on behalf of Dunstan
Thomas among more than 2000 Britons, has shown *Gen X* faces a bleak
future when it comes to retirement, with the loss of defined benefit
schemes, a reduction in the number of advisers since the Retail
Distribution Review, and financial pressures on all sides.

Read almost any article about mil-lennials and you'll come away with the
distinct impression that this generation is royally screwing up.

That they're suffocated by student debt. That they spend frivolously.
And that they're behind on everything from owning a home to starting a
family.

From the left: Dems Aren't in Love With Joe

To supporters, Joe Biden exists more "as an idea" than a "candidate,"
Alex Wagner sighs at The Atlantic. During the early primaries, almost no
Democrats said they would vote because someone, "especially Biden," made
"their hearts sing." Bernie Sanders' backers said they would vote for
Biden reluctantly, to stop Trump. Union members weren't "fired up" by
any Democrat but saw an "existential threat" from President Trump. Even
before the pandemic, the sense of voter "anguish and urgency" was
striking: Democrats were "terrified" at the prospect of four more years
of Trump. "Biden was never really convincing anyone," says Wagner. His
"political power" amounts to an "idea" about how to beat the president.
The trick for Dems now is to "keep that idea convincing enough, for long
enough," for the "corporeal man to actually win."

2020 JAN 31 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at
Economics Week -- As the oldest members of Generation Z move into the
workforce, a recent study by First Insight, Inc. the world's leading
technology company transforming how retailers and brands make product
investment, pricing and marketing decisions, found that they are making
more shopping decisions based on sustainable retail practices than even
Millennials and *Generation X*. Further, the study found that Baby
Boomers are far less concerned with sustainability when it comes to the
items they buy, even less so than their predecessors, the Silent Generation.

A lmost a Mirror is in some ways a love letter, or rather a mix-tape, to
*Generation X*. Kirsten Krauth's second novel marks the cultural
touchstones of growing up being enamoured of the pop and punk scenes of
the 1980s.

Stephanie Swanz was in a dark place when her friend and fellow chef Joe
Dodd called.

Swanz, the owner of Empamamas, was in despair over the closure of
Armature Works, where Empamamas sells empanadas, tacos and chicken
tenders inside the Heights Public Market. She agreed with Armature Works
ownership that the property needed to close — it draws thousands of
people every week, and public health officials are encouraging social
distancing to slow the spread of coronavirus — but she had 17 employees
who were now without work.

turkey carving, and you’re braced for Easter because you know
conversation won’t be about chocolate coins but real ones, you are not
alone: social research firm McCrindle named the #OKBoomer meme one of
the highlights of 2019.

Animoto survey breaks down where different generations are watching,
discovering, and buying in 2020

NEW YORK, March 31, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Animoto, the company that makes
it easy for anyone to create professional marketing videos, released new
data detailing consumer purchase behavior broken down by generation. The
consumer study showed that 70% of millennials trust brands with videos
about their products more than brands without videos. The survey also
revealed browsing and purchasing habits for Gen Z, *Gen X* and baby
boomers. Those metrics are key for businesses looking to zero in on a
particular customer base.

Angry and disaffected, the ''Prozac Nation'' author, who died this week
at 52, found new peace and purpose in her later years.

With Kurt Cobain, Tupac Shakur, Elliott Smith and Jeff Buckley gone,
that undersized, underwhelming demographic known as *Generation X* was
already short on idols. And after the death this past Tuesday of
Elizabeth Wurtzel, the ''Prozac Nation'' author and 1990s-angst poster
child, our confused, self-contradictory cohort may have lost the most
*Gen X* member of us all.

More men than women are stockpiling groceries and cutting back on
spending during the COVID-19 pandemic.

That’s according to a consumer survey from digital product testing and
decision-making platform First Insight, which found gender and
generational differences have a lot to do with how shoppers are
responding to the virus outbreak. The survey also revealed that news of
the COVID-19 virus is impacting the shopping behavior of 75% of
respondents, up from 45% compared to a survey fielded in late February.

A recent study by Queendom.com reveals that while perfectionistic tendencies tend to decrease with age, each generation still struggles to live up to personal and social standards. 
 

MONTREAL, March 7, 2020 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- International Women's Day
is a celebration of the societal barriers that women have fought long,
and fought hard, to break down. Simone de Beauvoir dared to challenge
the patriarchy's belief of a woman's role, and rights, in society. Frida
Kahlo spurred conversation on forbidden topics through her artwork. Mary
Church Terrel wasn't just one of the first African American women to
earn a college degree, she was also a strong advocate for women's right
to vote. In spite of the progress women have made in the fight for
equality, research from Queendom reveals that many still feel they are
not enough ... they believe that in order to be loved, respected and
accepted, they need to be better, look better, do more, be more, give more.

Expectations for more sustainable retail practices are growing as the
oldest members of Generation Z move into the workforce, a new study has
found.

According to 'The State of Consumer Spending' by technology firm First
Insight, 62% of Generation Z survey participants prefer to buy from
sustainable brands, on par with Millennials, while 54% of *Generation X*
and 44% of the Silent Generation said the same. However, only 39% of
Baby Boomers agreed, pointing to a vast divide between Baby Boomers and
younger generations.

In her early 40s, Ada Calhoun found herself racked with doubt about past
and future decisions. Despite a long marriage and professional success
as a journalist and author of the book "Wedding Toasts I'll Never Give,"
she lay awake at night worrying about credit card debt and evaporating
job opportunities. She had heavy periods and crying jags. There was a
sketchy mammogram and she was gaining weight. Her response to her image
on her smartphone, even after putting on makeup and changing filters:
"Still house of horrors."

"I knew I felt lousy, but I didn't yet fully understand why," she writes
in the introduction to her new book "Why We Can't Sleep: Women's New
Midlife Crisis." As the title suggests, the book is her attempt to
answer that question.

Do young people save just like their parents? Do you manage your economy
in the same way? The education received conditions the relationship with
money, but really, the context, customs and economic situation determine
the saving capacity of each generation. Each age group therefore has its
own way of understanding money, which is conditioned, above all, by the
economic situation. According to the VI Savings Barometer of the Inverco
Observatory, forum for analyzing the investment dynamics of savers, each
generation also saves for a different purpose. Children under the age of
26, known as centennials, as claimed by content creator Alex Puértolas,
save mainly to grow their capital, while millennials (ages 26 to 38) and
*Generation X* (ages 39 to 50), make up the bulk of the active
professionals and those who have enjoyed a better standard of living, do
so to face unforeseen expenses.

Three years ago, Ada Calhoun couldn’t sleep. The 41-year-old writer
stared at her ceiling wondering why her hard-won accomplishments had
left her feeling exhausted, anxious and wanting. She had written two
well-regarded books and a long list of magazine articles. She was
married and her son had just been accepted to a great public middle
school. From the outside, she knew, her life looked good.

Yet she was kept awake by freelancing assignments that had fallen
through, corporate job opportunities that had evaporated and her
family’s looming credit card debt. When she looked in the mirror and saw
wrinkles and a wider midsection, she asked herself “whose body is this?”
After decades of doing everything right, growing up at a time when women
were told they could do everything, this was not how life was supposed
to go.

We live in a generation that is transfixed by the here and the now.
Quick fixes are increasingly becoming a way of life. The era of
*Generation X* (*Gen X*), born between 1965 to 1976, created more
thought leaders due to the longevity of one person in one particular
job. *Gen X* was more likely to have one career path over their
lifespan, due to the value of service, and by the time they retire, they
would have amassed knowledge in a particular profession; they naturally
became subject experts.

This traditional path of service has seen a great fall in numbers in
recent years. Manuel Grenacher, a serial tech entrepreneur from
Switzerland, states 'The younger generations aren't looking for the same
rewards or financial incentives from their jobs as older generations.
Rather than wages and stability being the anchors that help retain them,
they're driven by purpose and flexibility'.

Derailed by the Great Recession as youths, US millennials fear the
financial toll of the pandemic.

New York, United States - Thirty-nine-year-old Jon Bernier is the owner
of Tiny Fish Printing company in Rochester, a city in northern New York
State. Last week, he laid off all of his 32 employees after business
plummeted 90 percent following Governor Andrew Cuomo's order to shutter
all non-essential businesses to halt the spread of
coronavirus[https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/events/coronavirus-outbreak.html].

Pia Loeb has been waking up restless at 5 a.m., her mind swirling with
questions about where her mother should live and how to keep her young
family safe from the coronavirus – although it sometimes seems like
she’s the only one of them worrying.

Until last week, her septuagenarian mother was still playing tennis in
her thrice-weekly clinic. And on the same day she was pleading with her
mother over the phone to stay put at home in her apartment in New York’s
Westchester County, Ms. Loeb found out her tween daughter, who was sent
to school to pick up her things before it shuttered and come right home,
had instead gone to the local shopping center with a group of friends.

On a recent Saturday afternoon, I stood with my 13-year-old son in a
long line stretching over the West Side Highway, cars careening below
us. He was waiting to take an entrance exam for a specialized high
school, a sacred moment, and yet I kept glancing at my phone to check
the time. I had to meet my mother to tour an apartment because my
childhood home in the East Village had burned down the week prior—a
month after my father was diagnosed with late-stage lung cancer. My
parents, who are in their 70s, were too overwhelmed to handle the
logistics of finding a sublet on their own. On that day, and just about
every day these past few months, I had to choose between caring for one
family member or another. With so many crises under way, caring for
myself hasn’t really been on the table.

Book review "Why We Can't Sleep," by Ada Calhoun; Grove (267 pages, $26)

I remember seeing it on Facebook, shared by seemingly every woman my age
in fall 2017 - hundreds of thousands of times in a few days. A viral
Oprah.com essay, in which writer Ada Calhoun described the "new" midlife
crisis hitting *Generation X*. She wrote about women who were exhausted,
overwhelmed, pounded by a unique combination of family and financial
stress and widely overlooked by a country obsessed with baby boomers and
millennials.

More than a decade ago, I was on the phone with a demographer. The call
got rescheduled more than once, thanks to me. I was working freelance,
but I was also a parent to two small children and, well, I don't even
remember what went wrong. Was it a playground fight? A child home sick?
A medical emergency with my parents? When we finally managed to connect,
she told me, "You know what the problem with your generation is? You are
expected to do more than twice as much as your parents and grandparents,
with less than half the support."

We all have our eureka moments. Mine came secondhand.

2020 APR 4 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at
Investment Weekly News -- A new study on Business Management is now
available. According to news reporting originating from Zaragoza, Spain,
by VerticalNews editors, the research stated, "The objective of this
paper is to analyze the existence of generational differences in work in
a series of variables that affect job satisfaction, distinguishing
workers born before the 70s, known as Boomers, and those born after that
date, *Generation X*. Design/methodology/approach - Methodologically an
earlier analysis is extended with the application of a Univariate
General Linear Model that allows measuring the differences of a
collective with respect to the base group. The work expands the
explanatory capacity of a previous work in which linear regressions was
applied to each of the two groups, Boomers and *Generation X*.

Bhubaneswar, March 10 -- Bhubaneswar: Holi is an ancient Hindu festival
that celebrates the colours of victory of truth over evil. But the
spirit of the festival this year seems apparently under seize by an evil
virus - the COVID-19.

In less than a month, the virus has entered into as many as eight
states. Pune (Maharashtra) and Punjab are the new additions yesterday.
COVID-19 positives were earlier detected in J&K, Karnataka, Delhi, UP
and Kerala. The positive count in India is fast inching towards the 50
mark as the numbers touched 47 yesterday late night.

If you ever wondered why you don’t see this colleague or that friend on
your Instagram feed, it might be because almost every other post is an
ad. At least it seems that way. Twitter is also loaded with promoted
posts, and your Facebook feed is filled with notices that tout so-and-so
liked something or other (their soft advertising entrée). Whether users
like them or not, those ads are having meaningful results for brands.

Marketers spent more than $89 billion on social media ads in 2019, a
figure that’s expected to increase 8.7 percent to reach $102 billion
this year, according to Sprout Social, a social media management and
optimization platform. The bulk of that, about $74 billion, is expected
to be generated via mobile advertising, while the remaining $27 billion
is projected to come from desktop ads, according to Statista.

The U.S. Census Bureau reports that all of the baby boomers will be age
65 or older by the year 2030. That is an estimated 73 million people
that were born after World War II from 1946 to 1964. The upcoming 2020
census will put an updated frame on this picture, but the next decade
could redefine how the entire workforce functions, including HVAC.

Just like the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks changed how airline
companies operated, similar changes will ripple across the housing
industry due to the rapidly spreading coronavirus.

That's what Cliff Long, CEO of the Orlando Regional Realtor Association,
sees in the future for the residential real estate market.

Every generation has a dark period they can vividly recall and narrate
to a future generation, but millennials in Kenya have endured more than
enough. From the HIV-Aids scourge to political upheavals of the 1980s
and 1990s to joblessness occasioned by state-sanctioned graft to the
Covid-19 pandemic, one cannot deny that my generation, the millennials,
somehow arrived on this world at the wrong time.

We are the generation that was born on the advent of the HIV-Aids
pandemic and grew up when the stigma associated with it was more
ravaging than the infection itself. Hundreds lost their breadwinners
-fathers and mothers -and a host of relatives who would have cared for
them once their parents departed. Being orphaned and re-orphaned
condemned dozens to a life of squalor in the streets and slums where
survival for the fittest was the mantra.

Mumbai, March 25 Variety Even as corporates are taking steps to tackle
issues like gender bias and even homophobia, ‘ageism’ or bias against a
person for their age, is becoming the new rogue at Indian workplaces,
according to a survey.

About 33 per cent of Indian employees face or have faced age-based bias
at their workplace, followed by 17 per cent who faced bias because of
their physical appearance and 15 per cent of others have faced bias on
the basis of their culture or religion, a survey by JobBuzz noted.

If your family Christmas always includes generational tension during the
turkey carving, then brace for the video calls this Easter, when thanks
to COVID-19, conversation won’t be about chocolate coins but real ones.
Because yes, Boomers know things.

Social research firm McCrindle named the #OKBoomer meme one of the
highlights of 2019, but company principal Mark McCrindle (right) says
these points of generational disconnect have always existed.

Gen Z are born to be digital; Gen Zers are digital natives, born between
1996 and 2010, they are studying in our higher Ed institutions now.
These students grew up not only with computers and internet access, but
also with smart phones, social media and mobile devices. It‟s time to
rethink and restructure the education system for these digital natives.
*Gen X* and Gen Y teachers, who have been using chalk & talk approach,
need to reshape curriculum and content delivery differently. Being
distracted learners, current students concentration span is low. We need
to make their learning experience rich and engaging, to empower them.

The outbreak of novel coronavirus has created an unprecedented situation
around the world, never seen in our lifetime. The shutdown is very
painful; staying at home and staying safe is the top priority. Amidst
this uncertainty and disruption Covid has brought in, there are
opportunities to initiate some positive changes in the field of education.

Never accuse Alex Garland of thinking small.

From his *Gen-X* touchstone novel "The Beach," to his mind-bending
science-fiction movies "Ex Machina" and "Annihilation," the British
writer and director has spent his career exploring grand ideas like
utopianism and artificial intelligence, in multiple mediums. Now he's
attempting television with "Devs," an eight-episode technothriller on
Hulu's new FX hub (it also airs on FX Canada Thursdays at 10 p.m.).

convey to younger than *Gen X* how nicely ubiquitous he and the team
were when we were growing up. They'd be on Wide World of Sports a few

Targeting different demographics just got easier.

While there’s about a 30-year difference between Generations X and Z,
the two cohorts share a number of similarities that affect the way they
respond to marketing—and an expert is recommending that brands and
retailers use the crossover to their advantage.

Physicians ages 40 to 54 experience a higher rate of burnout than
younger or older physicians, according to a recent survey of more than
15,000 physicians who cited administrative tasks and work hours as key
drivers of their stress.

Nearly half of *Generation X* physicians reported feeling burned out,
compared with 38% of millennials, ages 25 to 39, and 39% of baby
boomers, ages 55 to 73, surveyed. Roughly half of all the doctors
surveyed also said that they would be willing to take a substantial pay
cut to achieve a better work-life balance.

When we hear the word disruption, most think of it as a bad thing. In
the swine industry disruption comes in many forms: environmentalists and
animal rights activists are negatives. Disruption also comes as new
technologies, management practices and even people that can all be
positive for the industry. Millennials, especially are being referred to
as disruptors in the workplace and not always in a positive light but
shouldn't we be focused on the positives?

Young employees now entering their prime working years are so far
proving as loyal to employers as the generation before them, despite a
hot job market.

In January 2018, 70% of workers between the ages of 22 and 37, commonly
known as the millennial generation, had worked for their current
employer for 13 months or more, according to an analysis of federal data
by the Pew Research Center. By comparison, that number was 69% for
workers who were in the same age group in 2002 and are known as
*Generation X*.

We’re ‘the lucky generation’ – healthier, richer and more independent
than at any time in history. So why can’t we sleep at night? Author Ada
Calhoun has some surprising theories

At first I thought it was just me. Several scheduled freelance jobs had
evaporated and my husband and I had amassed a considerable credit-card
debt. I’d wake up in the middle of the night and not be able to get back
to sleep. I’d lie there thinking of all the things I really should do,
or should not have done, until it was time to get up. From the outside,
I know my life looked enviable; so why was I so miserable and anxious?

Older generations are fond of bemoaning the sad state of affairs in the
generations following them. Boomers found *Generation X* lazy and
slothlike, buoyed by a healthy economy and relative peacetime. *Gen X*
thought millennials, addicted to their screens and Facebooks, are
entitled and judgmental. 

(It goes the other way too — see: “OK, Boomer,” aptly defined in our Gen
Z dictionary toward the front of this issue.)

to do it herself—with a little help from the app store.

She uses the Venmo app to pay for drinks when she goes out with friends,
and downloaded Stash the first time she wanted to invest after friends
told her it was easy to use.

The ubiquitous DDoS-mitigation and CDN provider, Cloudflare, announced
that its latest *Gen X* servers implement AMD EPYC processors ditching
Intel Xeons with its older Gen 9 servers. Cloudflare uses
multi-functional servers (just like Google), in which each server is
capable of handling any kind of the company's workloads (DDoS
mitigation, content delivery, DNS, web-security, etc.). The company
minimizes server hardware configurations so they're easier to maintain
and lower TCO. The hardware specs of its servers are periodically
updated and classified by "generations."

Until several days ago, some bars and restaurants were still crowded for
St. Patrick's Day. The beaches were full. It seemed that many young
adults were taking time to take steps to stop the spread of coronavirus.

"I kept hearing that 'eighty percent of cases are mild,'" said Christian
Heuer, a 32-year-old angel who tested positive for the virus last week
and has had a low fever for six days. "But this isn't just sneezing with
runny nose. It's serious. You're really sick."

smart working practices are negatively impacting their work-life balance.

The survey shows that three quarters (72%) of employers believe tech
helps to improve workflow and overall staff productivity. The biggest
fear from employees is the expectation to “always be on.” Further
concerns include the struggle to learn and apply new technologies (31%)
and the fear of technologies replacing jobs (22%).

Bret Easton Ellis was 21 and had not yet finished his college studies
when his first novel, Less than Zero (1985) starring disaffected
teenagers, rich and white, revolutionized American narrative from his
Los Angeles base. Three years later, from New York, on the other coast
of the country, Jay McInerney completed the demolition work with Neon
Lights. Disenchantment, nihilism, unrest, glamour, sex, rivers of
cocaine, pessimism and irony within the privileged class.

Three months after Lehman Brothers shut its doors in September 2008,
Kate McGaughey got a call from the company she worked at doing legal
research on oil-and-gas leases. She was being laid off.

With no savings after only five months in her first job after college,
she had to take on four part-time positions and sell her bicycle, laptop
and musical instruments to keep a roof over her head. She used to joke
that her liberal-arts education had gotten her a bachelor's in unemployment.

A federal judge in the Eastern District of Washington sentenced a couple
to prison for fraud and making false statements to the government in
connection with a renewable energy fraud scheme, the U.S. Department of
Justice said in a Jan. 24 new release.

After pleading guilty in June 2019, Hector Garza Jr., 49, was sentenced
to two years in prison followed by a three-year term of supervised
release for making false claims to the IRS, according to the release.
Tammy Garza, 38, who also pled guilty, was sentenced to four months in
prison and one year of supervised release for aiding and abetting false
statements. Their companies, HTG Trucking LLC and Freedom Fuel Inc.,
were placed on probation for three years, and the defendants were
ordered to pay restitution to the U.S. of $284,546 plus a $100,000 fine.
