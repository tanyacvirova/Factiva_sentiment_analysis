The gender-job shift is one of the most important social issues of our
time. It goes to the heart of our determination to provide equal access
to jobs. The argument being that over time women have been largely
excluded from male-dominated jobs and that imbalance is being corrected
in a process called the great gender-job shift.

This is an important issue for the property industry because, if a
gender-job shift is under way, then women will have a rising capacity to
independently buy residential property. This could create a market
nuanced to female needs — for example, greater security features.

If you look carefully at the downtown Minneapolis skyline you can see
Carl Runck’s influence.

Throughout his 12-year career, Runck has led more than $500 million in
downtown development projects, including the redevelopment of Block E
into Mayo Clinic Square, the $72 million, 319-unit Latitude 45
Apartments, the 168-unit Maverick North Loop Apartments, and the
41-story, $251 million Eleven luxury condominium tower. He was named
director of real estate development at Minneapolis-based Ryan Cos. US
Inc. about five years ago. Prior to that, he served as vice president of
development at Minneapolis-based Alatus.

A circus story told inside a bigtop circus tent, a show staged in a
nearby coffee shop to ponder what happens to your online presence after
death and an East Coast-style kitchen party.

Those are just three of the 10 shows in the Grand Theatre's 2020-21
season, which also includes the holiday classic Annie; a new production
of Blyth Festival's controversial hit In the Wake of Wettlaufer,
starring renowned Canadian actor R.H. Thomson; the Shaw Festival's
acclaimed production of the comedy classic Cyrano de Bergerac; the
Broadway hit In the Heights; and a return of playwright-director-actor
Rick Miller with Boom X, a new instalment of his 2015 hit Boom.

Are you a doomsday prepper? Are you ready if the COVID-19 pandemic turns
into a worse-case scenario that has all of us clinging to a wing and a
prayer? It's tough to imagine. This is not meant to induce panic, but to
introduce a new survey by Finder.com that asked 1,200 random Canadians
across the country if they are prepared to handle the worst if it comes.

The pandemic has certainly spawned a lot of weirdness - strange polls,
bizarre talk-show segments, wild rumours and new slogans - amidst the
legitimate concerns of the average Canadian, including those living
beyond the anonymity of big cities.

Driverless vehicle
technologies[https://www.jpost.com/Tags/autonomous-vehicles] have long
promised to transform our societies and urban experiences, eliminating
traffic jams and fatal road accidents. Yet the key to handing over
control of the steering wheel might not be a question of technology, but
rather a matter of trust.

In a 2017 study carried out by the American Automobile Association
(AAA), 78% of Americans said they were afraid to ride in a self-driving
vehicle. Researchers found that baby boomers (85%) were more likely to
be afraid than millennials (73%) and *Generation X* (75%) drivers, and
women (85%) were more likely to be afraid than men (69%).

Millennials are more loyal to specific brands than any other category of
shoppers, a new survey shows, debunking the stereotype on shopping in
this age set.

With the increased usage of smartphones and internet-supported devices,
the Millennials’ needs and expectations have been a nightmare to
businesses as they seek ways of attracting customers in this demographic.

A new era of hold baggage screening started at Gatwick in August 2019
with the whole airport operating the latest Explosive Detection Systems
(EDS) Standard 3 technology, which can look for a new generation of threats.

Gatwick was the first large UK airport to achieve this landmark and the
programme was completed more than a year ahead of the EUs deadline for
compliance. As a consequence, the airports baggage experts are now in
high demand from airports across the world as they too start integrating
new scanners into their baggage systems.

Biohackers have often been seen as obsessive cranks – but the COVID-19
pandemic is making people look again at developing a routine of exercise
and medication that can help people live 'forever'

Human life expectancy has increased steadily for nearly 200 years – but
it could reach as high as 180 in the future once the world survives
beyond the coronavirus pandemic.

Young people take a more sensible approach to job hunting, and
everything else

"Times are bad. Children no longer obey their parents, and everyone is
writing a book". Cicero, to whom that line is attributed, was not the
last to look at a younger generation and see a bunch of feckless
narcissists. It is no different for Generation Z, those born between the
mid 1990s and early 2010s. Their image is one of perpetually offended
"snowflakes" who refuse to confront facts they find uncomfortable. Yet
research shows that there is a steely eyed pragmatism to Gen Z,
particularly when compared with the generation before them, the millennials.

attorneys — who currently make up only 1 percent of legal practitioners
across the state.

In three trenchant, enjoyable acts, Mike
Bartlett[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2017/10/04/doctor-foster-creator-mike-bartlett-interview-want-everyone/]’s
Love, Love, Love (2010) delivers a provocative punch to the guts of the
Baby
Boomers[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/features/11002767/Gen-Z-Gen-Y-baby-boomers-a-guide-to-the-generations.html].
Whether in revival in 2020, it can be described as a well-timed one is
another matter.

The play traces the Beatles generation’s trajectory from apparent
idealism and carefree hedonism in the Sixties, to midlife domestic
upheavals (born of a resurgent free spirit) at the end of the
Thatcher[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/11006181/Thatcher-gene-is-key-to-needing-less-sleep.html]
era, winding up in a blasé, cushy retirement period in 2011, with the
Tories back in power (sort of).

UK director Alex Garland thinks Parasite’s recent sweep of the Oscars is
proof positive that audiences are smarter than studios give them credit for.

Ahead of the release of his new sci-fi series, the cerebral,
mind-bending Devs, Garland says that film and TV viewers are being
“patronised” by a studio system that’s propped up by superhero movies
and action blockbusters and over-reliant on focus groups to the point
that new and original ideas struggle to get a look-in.

The average American spends close to 2,000 hours at work each year.
That’s around 250 lunches eaten at desks or at the nearest fast food
outlet, or maybe skipped altogether under a deadline crunch. In other
words, it’s a lot of opportunities for employees to practice poor
nutrition, and that’s bad news for employees and employers alike.

New Delhi, March 21 (IANS) During the late 1990s and early 2000s when
the millennials were still taking baby steps and *Generation X* were in
awe with classic flip phones, Samsung did bring one such device called
SGH-X426 which became popular with a lot of people for two simple
reasons: pocketable form factor and that unforgettable pride in flipping
the phone open in the air to accept a phone call.

Flip phones are back -- upwards of Rs 1 lakh -- and Samsung which
initiated the new-age foldable war with Galaxy Fold is back with Galaxy
Z Flip that folds into the size of a wallet, so you can easily fit it in
your pocket or clutch bag, like a make-up compact.

With many New Year’s resolutions to lose weight already abandoned, Dr.
Andres Acosta is hard at work developing new treatments to fight the
growing epidemic of obesity.

Acosta has spent much of his career studying gastrointestinal physiology
and is founder and CEO of Mayo Clinic spinout Phenomix Sciences where he
has raised more than $1.5 million to develop a new precision-medicine
approach to treat obesity. The company is creating a blood test that
helps patients determine how best to lose weight and stay healthy based
on their individual genotypes. In addition to raising some of the funds
on equity crowdfunding site Wefunder, Phenomix won $500,000 at the MEDA
Million Dollar Challenge and $45,000 at the MN Cup.

Washington (dpa) - With the coronavirus outbreak sweeping across parts
of the US, there are signs the sale of legal cannabis is on the rise,
with areas of California designating the dispensaries as essential
services which may stay open despite wider shutdowns.

The industry has also been urging users to consume marijuana safely, to
avoid vape pens and sharing joints, saying the switch to edible cannabis
might be the best option at the moment.

With the rise of companies like The Real Real, ThredUp, Poshmark and
more, it seems as if consumers are moving away from fast fashion and
toward a more sustainable way of
styling[https://www.adweek.com/retail/whats-your-fashion-footprint-thredups-quiz-will-tell-you/]
their closets.

And a new report from Poshmark provides some clarity to these
assumptions. The report, which surveyed 8,000 shoppers in the U.S. and
Canada, provides insight into who’s using the Poshmark platform and how
different generations are thinking about resale, secondhand and fast
fashion. For example, 16.5% of Gen Z closets are made up of secondhand
items. Millennials are close behind with 12.5%, *Gen X* is even higher
with 14%, and baby boomers are closing in at 9.5%.

*HD* 	Millennials Make Up Lion's Share of U.S. Home Buyers; The older
end of the generation is less likely to look at real estate as an

Millennials now represent a significant majority of U.S. homebuyers,
according to the National Association of Realtors (NAR), though there
are notable demographic differences between older millennials (which NAR
describes as those between 30 and 39 years old) and younger millennials
(between 22 and 29 years old).

According to NAR's 2020 Home Buyers and Sellers Generational Trends
Report released Thursday, older millennials and younger millennials
represent 25% and 13% of buyers, respectively, compared to Gen Xers
(ages 40 to 54) who made up 23% of the market.

According to Finder’s latest drunk shopping survey, almost a quarter of
American consumers shop while intoxicated. Which is good news for
retailers, like Nordstrom, who have in-store bars.

While the percentage of Americans who admit to shopping under the
influence decreased slightly in the past year to 22.9 percent, compared
with 26.4 percent in 2019, the average spending on drunk purchases has
increased from $674.96 to $768.58. In total, Americans spent $44.9
billion on drunk purchases in the last year.

The Government is facing a real challenge at the moment, and it's not
just coronavirus and Wednesday's budget. At some stage it has to
consider exactly what it is binding online publishers to when the new
duty of care is decided upon.

A final decision is probably several months away because there will
likely be a far-reaching public consultation on what, in particular, the
social media giants will be expected to protect users against.

Members of digital-native Gen Z are particularly engaged by multifaceted
content — meaning content rooted in recommendations that comes from a
diverse set of channels and formats, confirms a new multi-generational
media consumption study from video tech company Connatix.

"For Gen Z, media consumption is about having more of everything to
minimize a piece of content," notes the company's CEO, David Kashak.
"Gen Z wants more video, more audio, and more feedback loops integrated
into their content. They have a high regard for curation and
recommendations, and will use these features in concert with social
media and UGC as a North Star for the stories they ultimately delve into
more deeply on publishers' sites."

In his session at the second edition of Star FLOW, Philipp Kristian
Diekhoner, trust futurist and innovation strategist, author of The Trust
Economy, spoke about making trust your superpower in the digital age.

In the beginning he mentions that trust is often daunting and
uncomfortable. But he says this can be changed. "When people trust your
stories, everything changes. And that is what marketers should do - tell
simple and interesting stories. But don't tell stories you can't own."

Ask any of your *Gen-X* working mother mates what they would most like

THEY are the “Wallpaper Millennials”: Gen Y homeowners who still don’t

Coined by demographer Bernard Salt, the term refers to a new generation
of home buyers forced to navigate the two great home-owning power blocs
– *Gen X* and Baby Boomers.

Dresses, dogs, even friends… These days everything is for rent-and
midlifers are hiring up a storm. Novice Hannah Betts, 48, tries it out

A Monday night in
Mayfair[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/united-kingdom/england/london/central/west-end/mayfair/]
and I am cowering in a doorway, sheltering a diminutive bundle from the
rain. Look fleetingly, and you might imagine that I’m shielding a baby
under my coat; look closely, and you will see that it is actually a
small Chloé bag, embroidered with prancing horses. My face and hair may
be drenched, but my arm candy remains unsullied. ‘Lady, you must really
love your handbag,’ proffers a passing youth. ‘I do, yes! Only it’s not
mine, it’s rented, so I must guard it with my life,’ I reply, before
wrapping a cashmere scarf around it and making a run for a cab.

WASHINGTON,– A number of the homebuying characteristics of younger
millennials are replicating the buying desires of those in the silent
generation.

This is according to the latest study from the National Association of
Realtors®, the 2020 Home Buyer and Seller Generational Trends report,1
which researched each generation to examine the differences of recent
homebuyers and home sellers.

At age 30, Andy Kocemba became president, CEO and co-owner of Calhoun
Cos., a brokerage firm that specializes in connecting buyers and sellers
of small to mid-size businesses. He's been making a significant impact
on the Twin Cities business community ever since.

Now 39, Kocemba has modernized the century-old business' brand, created
more strategic alliances, initiated new sales processes, and launched
innovative customer-relationship management tools. That's resulted in
agents closing nearly 300 deals — representing a total value of more
$250 million — in the past five years alone.

We may be facing a fast-moving health crisis among older generations
that mostly doesn't directly impact the health of younger ones, a kind
of age-based trolley problem.

There's a lot we don't know about Covid-19, but one dynamic appears
clear: The health danger is highest for older people and those with
preexisting health conditions, such as asthma, cardiovascular disease,
and diabetes. In South Korea, where there is a lot of testing and a
strong public health system, not a single person under 30 has died from
the disease. Only two people under 50 have died out of 3,263 South
Korean cases reported on March 8. On the Diamond Princess cruise ship,
out of 705 coronvirus cases, there have been 8 fatalities — and none of
these were under 70.

Generation Z in Thailand are more entrepreneurial, more concerned with
financial success and more open to diverse viewpoints than their
counterparts in Western countries, says a study by Stamina Asia, a
Bangkok-based research company.

The results of the "Meet the Zers" study found Thai Generation Z share
most of the features with their contemporaries in the West: they also
want to challenge the status quo in terms of values, environment,
technology and relationship with brands.

The days when a relative minority of people can invest and manage their
money effectively are coming to an end, rapidly brought about by new
technologies. Alongside this, the behavior of a new generation of
investors will reshape investment in ways we can’t even currently
imagine – they are the drivers of a sea change in the wealth management
industry.

From the perspective of the banks, there has long been a vast untapped
source of opportunity among consumers of certain demographics – for
example, those commonly referred to as “mass affluent”. According to
Accenture, past attempts to target the mass-affluent market have largely
failed because of high servicing costs. There is truth to this: wealth
investing has traditionally been conducted face–to-face through a
relationship manager, and the costs of managing a portfolio manually
mean that the minimum amount needed to invest can be prohibitive for some.

Eventually, the economy and the stock market will recover and COVID-19,
the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, will be contained. Yet the
current pandemic and its economic consequences could devastate the
retirement prospects of some Baby Boomers, while permanently changing
the attitudes of many more.

“This is going to leave a real imprint on the minds of people who are
near or in retirement,’’ says Joseph
Coughlin[https://www.forbes.com/sites/josephcoughlin/#30f979a8398a],
director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
AgeLab[https://agelab.mit.edu/]. “It’s a personal health 9/11 for much
of the country.”

WHETHER they’re already in retirement, or heading that way, Baby Boomers

This weekend, in a parallel universe not currently experiencing a global
pandemic, our doppelgangers are heading out to advance screenings of the
new James Bond film No Time To Die which, in our universe, got moved to
a more fiscally responsible release date some time after the fall of
modern civilisation.

Much of the big-screen releases we've been looking forward to have
followed suit, and so we turn to the small screen to fill the long weeks
ahead.

The weekend leading up to Super Tuesday (March 3) saw first-time

(MN) Amy Klobuchar, each having gained national traction, abruptly call
it a day and throw their support to former vice president and
frontrunner of the moment, Joe Biden.

Australia’s business leaders need to step up and be vocal about
important issues like climate change, according to Atlassian co-CEO and
billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes, who says workers — particularly
millennials — will leave businesses that don’t fit their personal values.

Tech outfit Atlassian commissioned a study from PwC that found 39 per
cent of employees agreed or strongly agreed that if their employer was
to act in a way that didn’t align with their values, they would quit
their job.

one of the leading noncommercial stations in the country.

“Leave the playground better than when you arrived.” That was the advice
given to Trisha Sieh by her mother and she lives by it still today.

In college, when Sieh switched to an engineering major, she was told,
“Girls can’t be civil engineers.” Not only is Sieh a professional
engineer in six states, she became an owner and office practice leader
at Kimley-Horn and Associates Inc. — a national planning and design
consulting firm — at age 35.

The Sacramento region's workforce is increasingly intertwined with the
gig economy, a trend that's likely to continue.

That's according to Valley Vision, a locally based research an advocacy
group, which conducted a recent survey of the region's workforce
alongside California State University Sacramento's Institute for Social
Research. The two groups compiled the findings from 826 survey
respondents from Sacramento, Placer, El Dorado, Yolo, Sutter and Yuba
counties.

Usually this time of year, reporters and critics for The New York Times
are busy covering dance, theater and musical performances at a breakneck
pace. Not so this season, shut down this month by the coronavirus
outbreak. Instead, we asked writers to share suggestions for what to
watch, read or listen to while we're housebound this weekend.

ITALY

New statistics from Italy, the ­centre of the coronavirus pandemic in
Europe, have shown that while it is overwhelming very old people who are
dying of the disease, Millennials, *Gen X* and medical workers also face
a significant risk of being hospitalised.

While salary remains to be the top driver of attracting the work force,
Filipino talents who prefer working in SMEs, start-ups, and
province-based companies look for jobs that offer flexibility, social
involvement, less bureaucracy, job security, among others.

In 2019, JobStreet Philippines, the No. 1 online job portal in the
country, reveals salary/compensation, career development, and work-life
balance as the top 3 drivers of attraction among the Filipino work force
based on their recently conducted extensive study, Laws of Attraction,
with more than 18,000 respondents. However, JobStreet Philippines
believes that attracting and retaining young professionals and top
talents are more than just providing competitive compensation. With
varying business setups in the country, LOA unveils possibilities for
enterprises to understand the work force and effectively modify their
approach in hiring talents.

*HD* 	Fear of missing out: Int'l wealth firms rush to tap new client
segment

As the international wealth management industry looks to attract new
generations of wealthy clients over the next decade, a growing number of
the world's wirehouses, private banks and advisory boutiques are
restructuring their wealth businesses to appeal to clients in the lower
end of the wealth spectrum so as not to miss out on these future revenue
generators.

Last November, under the new leadership of international wealth
management boss Philipp Wehle, Credit Suisse revamped its core private
banking international unit as part of its wider strategy to streamline
its services to the high net worth and mass affluent tiers. The
restructure of the three-year-old unit, which had historically
prioritized Credit Suisse's ultra-high net worth and strategic clients,
the latter of whom are mostly billionaires, saw Wehle urge the firm's
private bankers to move international client accounts with $20m or less
to the newly restructured unit, which previously had serviced clients
with $5m or less.

AILSA CHANG: A lot of rock music is made by young people about being
young. But as rockers enter middle age, is there a graceful way for
their music to age? Stephen Malkmus made his name as the frontman for
the band Pavement, which he started in his 20s. Their slacker
anti-establishment vibe was an influential part of the underground '90s
rock scene.

When I wake up in the morning, I practice mindfulness and meditate in
bed for about 15 minutes to ground myself. I then check my emails,
double-tap a few photos on my Instagram feed, get out of bed, brush my
teeth, do my (nauseously long) skincare, walk to work, make a homemade
almond milk latte in my silicone carry away cup (again, to save the
environment) and get to work.

If I ever start to feel sick, I’ll chug a kombucha from the local bodega
in hopes that it will kill any bug in me. Despite my mom’s insistence, I
loathe going to the doctor because I’d rather spend my money and time,
well, anywhere else. More often than not, I end up in urgent care,
proving my mother right once again.

Workers won’t have to choose between paying off their student loans and
saving for retirement with a new benefit from CommonBond, a student loan
repayment benefit provider.

The company launched a new product earlier this year that allows
employees who aren’t saving for retirement to receive an employer
contribution to their retirement fund — as long as they’re paying off
student debt. The program, called Retirement Contribution, tracks and
verifies employee student loan payments so they can qualify for employer
contributions.

Coldwell Banker left transactional ads in the dust long ago, moving past
the category trope of showing real estate agents shaking hands with new
homeowners in front of a “sold” sign.

Instead, the brand has tugged at consumers’ collective heartstrings,
focusing for the past several years on its pet rescue
program[https://www.adweek.com/creativity/coldwell-bankers-adorable-somebody-to-love-ad-extends-commitment-to-pet-adoption/].
And now, coinciding with its first rebrand and logo makeover in 40
years, the company taps into the magnetic pull of home and the profound
joy of arriving there with a spot set to the classic ballad “Homeward
Bound” from Simon &
Garfunkel[https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/owning-up-to-its-scandals-volkswagen-seeks-a-light-out-of-its-darkest-era-in-new-ad/].

It’s no secret that different generations view current events with
different perspectives. Sometimes these differences lead to strife, but
pollster John Zogby and his son, Jeremy, have chosen to take advantage
of their generational perspective gap.

With their podcast, “The Zogby
Report[https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-zogby-report-real-and-unscripted/id1494638311],”
they discuss the news through the lens of a baby boomer and a
millennial. In today’s episode of The Daily Signal Podcast, the Zogbys
share why they decided to start the show and some of today’s most
pressing topics, including America’s growing fascination with socialism.

Soma Tah The one work culture that clearly differentiates *Gen X* people
from Gen Y and Z people is the latter’s clear apathy for the 9-to-5 work
culture. Internet connectivity, and the cloud and mobile-based
collaboration tools have eased their problems out to a great deal, by
enabling them to get their work done without being shackled to the
confines office spaces.  Studies have also shown that working outside
the offices makes people more social, agreeable, empathetic, and
trustworthy, and which organization would not want these qualities in
their employees? Hence, organizations made a note of that and decided to
dangle the ‘flexible work’ carrot to woo the young talents.   Workforce
collaborations are an imperative requirement in the modern-day workplace
and millennial workforce.

I know it doesn't feel like it right now, but business is still getting
done in New Mexico.

The Covid-19 virus has changed nearly everything in our day-to-day
lives, and that won't change soon. There is an incredible amount of
uncertainty, and my advice, when the ground beneath you feels like
quicksand, is to hold on to something sturdy and try to move forward.

Philippines' independent power producer First Gen has filed an
application with the Department of Energy (DOE) for a temporary offshore
LNG terminal at its complex in Batangas city. The project requires
modification of First Gen's existing jetty that will allow it to receive
large- and small-scale LNG vessels and to build an adjacent onshore gas
receiving terminal.

With the DOE's approval, First Gen's subsidiary FGen LNG would be able
to deploy a 5 million ton/yr floating storage and regasification unit on
an interim basis, which would accelerate its plan to introduce the first
LNG to the Philippines.

On unity

After the tragic events of a year ago, the Prime Minister said “we are
one”. Oh I wish that were true. While the divisive rhetoric of Shane
Jones continues it shows how much there is still to do.

The author's kids, Jack and Juno, with their art creations: a racecar
and a TV

My third-grader Jack had only an hour's final exam for Math left before
school was called off, while my preschooler Juno's classes end late
April. Everyone was thrown for a loop, but during these uncertain times,
it's usually the moms who must add the impact to their mental load.
