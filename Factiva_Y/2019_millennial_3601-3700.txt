Changes in consumer attitudes, more competition among drink choices, a
sudden global glut of grapes and increases in productin costs have cast
some clouds over a wine industry that has grown accustomed to sunny
outlooks over the last few decades.

The U.S. wine market is still growing, but at a lower rate than before,
notes Danny Brager, senior vice president of the beverage marketing
practice at the Nielsen Co. Annual sales of wine cases rose by just 1.2
percent in 2018 to nearly 410 million cases, slowing a trajectory of
annual growth that reached as high as 6 percent in 2011, according to
bw166, which tracks the beverage alcohol industry.

has won $500,000 of backing from Radius Bank, Barclays, Techstars,
former Goldman Sachs managing director Alex Wohl and others.

Radius is already thinking about partnering with Gatsby and offering its
app to customers of the bank. Gatsby's mission is to let ordinary
people, especially millennials, make options trades.

*HD* 	WHY YOUR *MILLENNIAL* KID WON'T PICK UP THE PHONE

It's funny, I always thought I'd grow out of my hatred of talking on the
phone. I thought it was one of those insecure teenage behaviours, like
wearing a full face of makeup to leave the house, that would just
disappear as I became an adult. But while I'm now a functioning adult
who's happy to hit Countdown wearing no makeup (and a unicorn onesie), I
still struggle with taking and making calls.

On the surface, it's baffling why I have this incredibly specific,
first-world phobia. I don't have any deep-seated psychological fear of
conversation via phone. I wasn't beaten, electrocuted or trapped with a
cellphone in a jail cell for all of 2002 listening to the Crazy Frog
ringtone. And yet I'm a grown woman who pays bills/waters plants/drinks
almond milk . . . but puts off for two days calling her mum back.

Things are changing very rapidly in the European branded coffee shop
market. The 5th wave of coffee shops, urbanization, digital technology
and the needs of Generation Z will be important drivers of growth and
change. Market growth will continue across the continent.

These are some of the insights shared by Jeffrey Young, CEO & founder
Allegra Group, as he presented the Allegra Project Café Europe 2019
annual study at the European Coffee Symposium held on November 28-30,
2018 in Milan, Italy.

A continued slide in sales of the Harley-Davidson motorcycle in most of
its big markets, including Australia, has added to the poor sentiment
surrounding ASX-listed MotorCycle Holdings, which runs several big
Harley dealerships in Australia and is finding it harder to attract
*Millennial* customers.

The fresh evidence of a global downturn in the appeal of the famous
motorcycle brand came in a sales update to the New York Stock Exchange
which showed that sales in the Asia-Pacific region were 6.2 per cent
lower in the December quarter last year compared with a year ago.

The hardest-working man in America is the DJ at a midsize Philadelphia
concert venue called District N9NE. It's the Saturday after
Thanksgiving, and it has been an agonizing three hours since the doors
opened. This poor DJ is trying his hardest to distract hundreds of
fans—none of whom appear to be over the age of 22—from the glaring
absence of Juice WRLD, the year's newly minted hip-hop superstar.
They've come to see their digital hero in the flesh, but excitement has
curdled into restlessness, and after restlessness comes agitation. So
many Juuls have died that some fans have resorted to lighting up real
cigarettes inside the venue. For a moment, the DJ is able to pacify the
crowd by playing “GUMMO,” the viral New York street-rap anthem from the
then newly incarcerated Tekashi 6ix9ine, but the crowd's fury prevails.
“Juice WRLD will be here in five minutes,” the DJ announces in a tone
that's not exactly convincing.

Three or four times a year, Mercury appears to loop back on itself for a
period of about three weeks before continuing on its journey. The
smaller planet doesn't actually go backward. It just looks that way
because we're orbiting the Sun at a far slower pace. All the planets can
appear to us to be traveling in reverse. Mars, for example, was
retrograde this summer, in a gorgeous transit that made the planet glow
like a portentous red eye, low on the twilight horizon. To the ancients,
the bright, mysterious, meandering planets told a story. Mercury's has
endured into the present to become the kooky spiritualist's go-to
excuse. If the Roman god of communication, tricksters, and travelers is
caught in a loop, heaven help us mere mortals.

Jeff Spicoli did it. So did Dirty Harry, Batman, the Sundance Kid, and
Meathead. All actors really just want to direct. It's a cliché as old as
Hollywood itself—or at least as old as Charlie Chaplin's first
experiments with the form. So when Phil from The Hangover ascended to
the canvas-backed throne for what would become the most talked-about
movie this awards season, he was following in the footsteps of so many
who had come before him—some to great success, some to far less. For
Bradley Cooper and A Star Is Born, the results have been both box-office
gold ($370 million worldwide and counting!) and, mostly, critical
adoration—so it's easy to forget that a rookie directing himself and
Lady Gaga in a countrified retelling of Hollywood's central creation
myth wasn't such a sure bet this time last year.

An ‘MOT’-style career check-up for older staff could energise
undervalued employees

Jane Lockwood had a mini-epiphany last year. She realised that her age —
54 — had dented her professional self-belief. “I tend to be less
confident about going for promotions . . . I’ve limited myself [and]
thought that the promotions are for the young guys. I’ve always thought
about getting my staff up the ladder but lost that aspiration for myself.”

* The Shanghai Stock Exchange's new tech startup board will have broader
daily trading limits than existing exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen,
Reuters reports. Stocks will be allowed to fall or rise 20% in a day
before trading is halted, compared to 10% in other boards. The new
trading board is set to become China's first platform where pre-profit,
high-tech startups and companies with dual-class shareholding structures
would be able to conduct IPOs and be traded publicly.

Experts predict that by 2020, millennials (those who reached adulthood
around the turn of the century) will make up 35 per cent of the global
workforce, with Generation Z (born mid-90s to early 2000s) accounting
for a further 24 per cent.

With younger generations set to make up more than half the total
workforce population, businesses need to do what they can to attract and
retain these individuals.

It's an awkward question. Some kind person has put you up for the night,
or perhaps you're in a bijou boutique hotel. You come down to breakfast,
and your host asks: How did you sleep?'

My usual reply is, on the left-hand side with occasional forays to the
right to punch the Grumpy Yorkshireman to stop him snoring. I have been
known to strike out to that side even when sleeping alone, so ingrained
is the ­habit. Mind you, the rumbling Northerner has his uses. On one
occasion, I fell out of bed precisely because he wasn't there to stop me
rolling over.

Early contenders for the Democratic Party’s nomination for the 2020
presidential race are the most diverse in US political history,
reflecting the changing demographics and power equations of a party in
ferment.

Nine have declared their candidacy thus far, including four women one of
whom is of Indian and Jamaican parentage, an openly gay small town
mayor, a Taiwanese American and a Hispanic American. More are likely to
join in the coming months and the field could swell to more than 20.

Merchants will have to be everywhere — and do everything — to compete in
the future.

Mastering the brick-and-click art of omnichannel is just the start. To
thrive, brands will also have to know how to market to more than just
Millennials, better understand their core demographic and become expert
at leveraging data.

Justin Trudeau wants his fans (and leftish voters) to think he's nothing
like Stephen Harper. Stylistically, that's true. And the current prime
minister is as nonchalant about deficits as his predecessor was obsessed
by them. But if you think about it, their headline economic policies
aren't so different.

Team Trudeau's favourite sop to the middle class, the Canada Child
Benefit, is a modified version of a big present that Harper gave to
voters with children. The Liberals cut the small-business tax rate to
nine per cent, fulfilling a Harper promise from the 2015 campaign.
Canada was among the first group of countries to ratify the
Trans-Pacific Partnership because the party that Harper led for a decade
allowed rapid passage of the enabling legislation.

This is definitely a First World problem, but recently I went to two
restaurants hoping to write about them. The food was pretty meh at both,
and since I write about restaurants I can recommend, I was stressed. As
deadline approached, I beelined to a third.

Relief might have influenced my enjoyment of Mangia Cucina and Bar, but
I don't think so. It's a cosy little restaurant in a semiindustrial area
in Mount Pleasant in a blushing red vintage house. It's not to be
mistaken for Caffe Mangia and Pizzeria, which preceded it. Alessandro
Riccombono took over the restaurant four months ago and he strikes very
pleasant chords.

Independent Advisor Alliance, based in Charlotte, is looking to change
the way firms leverage technology to serve advisers in the finance industry.

Robert Russo founded IAA in 2013. The firm, although a separate entity,
is connected to LPL Financial Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: LPLA), as part of
its registered investment-adviser platform. It works with regulators on
behalf of financial advisers in reviewing infrastructure, compliance and
surveillance issues, Russo says.

FLORENCE — A vibrant bustle animated the hallways of the Fortezza da
Basso venue during the three-day trade show, which ended here on Jan. 25.

The 84th edition of the fair, which showcased yarn collections for the
spring 2020 season, drew 4,300 buyers coming from 50 countries,
registering a performance in sync with last year’s January edition. In
particular, key markets for the trade show were the U.K., France, the
U.S., Switzerland, Russia, Spain and Turkey while the number of Japanese
and German buyers slightly decreased.

It’s a weekend night and I have two dinner invites. But instead of going
I’m staying in.

I’ve got big plans. I’m thinking a home-cooked meal, maybe a good bottle
of red, a film, or maybe a board game with my boyfriend. Certainly
nothing that will involve leaving the house, engaging with strangers or
shouting over loud music. This is now what I look forward to. I fact,
staying in is my definition of luxury.

The Number One travel rewards credit
card[http://www.rewardscanada.ca/topcc2019/] in Canada is the American
Express Cobalt Card, according to RewardsCanada. What makes this choice
interesting is that this is not a card designed to appeal to high
earning, frequent flying executives and professionals.

Without making a big deal about it, Cobalt is pitched at millennials. It
offers five points per dollar spent on restaurant food and drink, two
points per dollar spent on travel and transit, and one point per dollar
on other purchases. Instead of charging annually, it has a monthly fee
of $10. For a generation used to paying monthly subscription costs for
Spotify and Netflix, that makes sense.

Economist Says

China's deep-seated economic problems will motivate its government to
make concessions intrade talks with the United States to avoid further
tariffs from the Trump Administration, but Beijing will draw the line on
any compromise it said would infringe on its sovereignty, a leading
economist said today.

The outlook for the U.S. economy is directly correlated to the talks'
outcome, said Donald Ratajczak, who runs the professor emeritus program
at Georgia State University and who has spent decades as a global
economist. The U.S. economy could fall into recession during the second
half of 2020 as many of today's warning signs of slowing domestic
activity become more prevalent, Ratajczak said. However, a substantive
resolution to the U.S.-China trade dispute would be bullish for U.S.
prospects and probably lead Ratajczak to shelve his recession call, he
said at the SMC3 winter meeting in Atlanta.

A group of businesses and environmental leaders jointly launched the
Plant Based Products Council (PBPC), a group of organizations working to
guide the global economy toward more sustainable and responsible
consumer products and packaging through greater use of plant-based
materials. The launch was announced at the California Air Resources
Board’s California Bioresource Economy Summit.

Recognizing that the ever-growing global demand for consumer goods and
convenient packaging poses a serious threat to the environment, the PBPC
promotes the adoption and use of products derived from renewable
biomass. The group will advocate for private sector programs and
government policies to encourage use of renewable materials and
feedstocks, including policies to reduce carbon emissions, improve water
quality and soil health and curtail solid waste destined for landfills
by purposeful closed loop end-of-life strategies through recycling and
composting.

process. Recent surveys of hiring managers and staffing firm employees
from CareerBuilder, Inavero and the American Staffing Association (ASA)

Dogfish Head Craft Brewery, known for beers made with exotic ingredients
that often boast high alcohol levels, is on a health kick.

The Milton, Delaware-based brewer will soon release Slightly Mighty IPA,
a low-alcohol ale (4 percent ABV) with only 95 calories and 3.6 grams of
carbohydrates, a profile rivaling that of post-workout favorite Michelob
Ultra (95 calories, 2.6 grams of carbs).

Four employees reportedly siphoned Rp 314 million (US$22,000) from the
finance loan company they worked for in Bekasi, West Java, doctoring the
ownership documents of stolen vehicles that they used as collateral.

Bekasi Police chief Comr. Parjana said that the four employees, all in
their 20s, purchased the vehicle ownership documents (BPKB) of stolen
vehicles on Facebook. They applied for loans by using the BPKBs as
collateral and forging the owner`s identity [using their own names],
Parjana said on Tuesday as quoted by kompas.com.

I started noticing it a few years ago: Seemingly every young person on
the internet was selling something. Not in the way that we're all
selling ourselves now, cultivating our personal brands on social media.
They were selling actual stuff. Shipping hoverboards from China and
unloading them in their American high schools. Running parody Twitter
accounts that fed into viral ad networks. Posting sponsored content on
Instagram for pocket money and freebies.

Occasionally these youthful businesses evidenced a casual relationship
with grift. The hoverboards literally blew up. The Twitter accounts
stole jokes from struggling comics. Teenage influencers started
concocting fake brand deals so they could appear worthy of corporate
sponsorship.

Arianne Phillips, the Oscar-nominated costume designer who became a
public name thanks to her work with Madonna, hit her long dark night of
the red carpet soul a few years ago.

''I was completely burned out on GoFundMe and tired of feeling like a
resister solely on social media,'' she said on the phone from Los
Angeles, where she had just finished working on ''Once Upon a Time in
Hollywood,'' the new Quentin Tarantino film. ''I kept thinking: What
does all this waste and excess amount to?''

A quarter of a century has passed since Lee Chang-dong broke into films
with his screenplays for Park Kwang-su's To the Starry Island (1993) and
A Single Spark (1995). He made his directorial debut with Green Fish
(1997) before making a mark on the festival circuit with Peppermint
Candy (2000) and Oasis (2002). However, he cemented his reputation as
one of South Korea's leading auteurs with Secret Sunshine (2007) and
Poetry (2010), which respectively earned Jeon Do-yeon the Best Actress
Prize at Cannes and presented the iconic Yoon Jeong-hee (who was part of
the so-called 1960s `troika' with Moon Hee and Nam Jeong-im) her first
screen role in 15 years.

If a *millennial* uses the word 'aesthetic' in any context, even if
you're standing near a trash can, please just take it as a compliment.
For, when we walk into an eatery and bar in Kala Ghoda with a couple of
friends on a weekday, that's the word they stop at. "Duh, this place is
called Millennials for a reason," we reply. Our friends have arrived
after scouting through Colaba for clothes, we've crossed the
Bandra-Worli Sea Link after a hectic day at work — you get the drift,
we're really hungry.

When it comes to eating habits, millennials have a clear preference for
clean.

Research from New Hope Network shows that millennials are more likely
than the generations before them to see food as medicine—a way to manage
their health conditions and detoxify their bodies. As a result, they’re
more likely to buy food that’s grown to maximize nutrition, for example,
food that’s local, organic or grass fed. In fact, while 66 percent of
millennials do so, just 39 percent of baby boomers do.
