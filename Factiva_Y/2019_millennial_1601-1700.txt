METRO PLUS Chef Kelvin Cheung talks about his Netflix cooking show and
the soup his mother used to make Chef Kelvin Cheung and TV personality
Rannvijay Singh bond seriously over chicken lollipop. While the latter
gives wings to his fiery-red ‘Chindian’ (Chinese-Indian) recipe, the
former does a proper gourmet-style chicken wings, and all this over
casual chit chat.

This is a slice from the You Got Chef’d series featured on Gobble’s
YouTube channel. One of the most popular food channels on the digital
entertainment platform, Gobble has over 2.8 million followers on
Facebook. The series, hosted by Cheung, was launched in December, and is
sort of a *millennial* cook-off, where guests — all social media
celebrities — cook popular dishes and Cheung does their gourmet versions.

Her fake Twitter account poking fun at ‘snowflake culture’ has 188,000
followers. Now Titania McGrath has a book out. Here’s how to be on message

Meet Titania, a 24-year-old poet who has become a social media
phenomenon — and yet nobody knows who she is. Her tweets Her tweets
lampooning right-on social activists, or woke culture, have caused a
sensation, but is she the alter ego of the satirist Lisa Graves or, as
some have speculated, is she written by a man? It’s the latest
“literary” mystery . . . I was born woke. My wokeness is innate. It
flows through me like a magical elixir, keeping my soul purged and
poised for the fight. In many ways, I am a modern-day Joan of Arc:
indomitable, precocious, fluent in French.

Kensington Palace has stepped with remarkable alacrity to deny what had
appeared to be a plausible report in the American glossy, Vanity Fair,
that the Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle, was intending to bring up her
baby as “gender fluid”.

A palace spokesman said in an emphatic statement: “This story is totally
false.”

talking about bridging the pay gap between men and women or attaining
equal parental leave … but this is still high stakes.

I’m talking about equal opportunity in fashion.

NEW DELHI: The 10-year challenge, capturing the change in one’s physical
appearance from what it was a decade ago, has got social media in a
frenzy. While it can make you feel good, there is not much to this. On
the other hand, if you set a 10-year financial challenge, it could make
a qualitative difference to your future.That is what Mumbai-based
finance professional Sandeep Singhal, 29, has done. The *millennial* set
himself the challenge of prepaying his ₹40-lakh home loan, which has a
balance tenure of 18 years, within the next 10 years. Instead of paying
the prescribed equated monthly instalment (EMI) of ₹37,500, he has
decided to direct ₹70,000. The probable result? He will ace the
challenge if he sticks to his plan over the next six years. Given his
earlier track record of saving for five years in a disciplined manner to
arrange for the ₹19 lakh down-payment for his home in 2016, he is
confident. “I avoided buying assets that are depreciating in nature.

At a time when online food ordering has become the new normal for
millennials and working couples, piping hot biryani has come out of the
oven in a big way, emerging as the most-loved comfort food across Metros
and suburbs in the country.

Like the way pizza and burger orders flourished, online food delivery
platforms have now crowned biryani as the king of most-craved dishes.

DESIGN Online trends can peak and disappear in an instant

Interior design concepts, once disseminated sluggishly via coffee table
books and glossy magazine spreads, now zip around the world thanks to
the chic multitudes who feed photo-friendly platforms like Instagram and
Pinterest. On the latter, only food, crafts and women’s fashion compete
with home decor for clickability and fascination.

Dozens of media players have lined up against technology giants Google
and Facebook, calling for the competition regulator to police the
digital platforms that have undermined the industry’s businesses.

The comments were made as the first wave of submissions to the
Australian Competition & Consumer Commission’s landmark review of the
market power of the technology giants was released.

The job of telling people right from wrong can be a powerful and
lucrative business - as the church, legal system and various governments
throughout history can attest to.

Balenciaga looked like everything — and nothing — you've seen before.
While Hermès quietly thrilled

The Balenciaga set was a vast black box that stank of asphalt. The
collection reeked of street. It was brilliant, bold and contemporary —
and there wasn't a sneaker to be seen.

Many Workplaces Are Opting for More Casual Dress Codes

For decades, dress codes in business environments were simple - suits or
jackets, ties, dresses, nylons. But there's been a shift in recent
years, at companies both large and small, toward a more casual dress
policy that projects professionalism through slightly more casual wear,
a trend often summed up in the phrase `dress appropriately.' The result,
proponents say, are more comfortable - and, hence, happier - workers,
which is something any company wants.

Jacques Panis is looking to do for Troy-based lab-grown diamond startup
New World Diamonds LLC what he did for Shinola/Detroit LLC: create a
sought-after luxury brand.

The odds are in his favor, given that Shinola was known as an old shoe
polish brand before Panis turned it into a high-end watch, bicycle and
leather goods brand.

Banana Republic is plugging its vegan suede jackets. J. Crew's Madewell
brand is urging consumers to turn their "old jeans" into "new homes"
through its denim recycling program. Even fast-fashion giants, such as
H&M and Uniqlo, which by definition are the opposite of ethically
sourced apparel, are touting organic collections or recycling
initiatives. Nearly every apparel marketer is following consumer demand
by leaping onto the green wagon.

WASHINGTON — Facing a showdown vote as early as this month over the
embattled “Green New Deal,” Senate Democrats are preparing a
counteroffensive to make combating climate change a central issue of
their 2020 campaigns — a striking shift on an issue they have shied away
from for the past decade.

Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, outlined the
new strategy in an interview last week, casting it as a way to mobilize
*millennial* voters, a key part of the Democratic constituency that the
party will need to turn out to win in swing states.

It's been a week since Olivia
Colman[https://www.hellomagazine.com/tags/olivia-colman/] won big at the
2019 Oscars, scooping up the Best Actress award for her stellar
performance in The
Favourite[https://www.hellomagazine.com/film/2019012266896/the-favourite-olivia-colman-rachel-weisz-ending-explained/].
But the star will be making her return to the small screen on Monday
night in the highly anticipated second series of Fleabag, a comedy
written by and starring Killing Eve showrunner Phoebe Waller-Bridge. The
series opener airs on BBC 1 at 10.35pm, with Olivia returning to her
starring role as the titular character's nameless Godmother. Hilarious
and passive aggressive, Olivia perfectly plays the character you love to
hate, even earning the actress a TV BAFTA nomination for her
performance, eventually losing the accolade to her co-star, Phoebe.

Although it's too early to predict what changes will come to Sprint
Corp.'s Overland Park headquarters campus once its sale to Occidental
Management is
completed[https://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2019/03/01/sprint-occidental-management-overland-park-campus.html?iana=hpmvp_kan_news_headline],
a market researcher notes that any shift will not have an immediate effect.

That's because space on the roughly 4 million-square-foot campus has
been for lease to outside companies since 2009, with about 1 million
square feet of the space already leased as of August.

Acknowledging that “change is never easy,” Kevin Tsujihara, Warner Bros.
chairman and CEO, assured employees that the WarnerMedia reorganization,

meaningful relationships with our fans and consumers.”

As for the possibility of layoffs, Tsujihara told The Hollywood

as a better alignment of resources. We are not going into this with a
head-count target of what we need to do. We want to grow profits."

The very first episode Bravo’s latest reality series Mexican
Dynasties doesn’t waste any time when it comes to breaking stereotypes
of the Mexican culture. Produced by Jaime Davila’s Campanario
Entertainment, the show follows three affluent Mexican families in
Mexico City (the Allendes, the Bessudos and the Madrazos) and right off
the bat, the families make it known that the Mexicans are more than
housekeepers, gardeners, busboys and other stereotypes Hollywood tends

A few years ago, Tom, my brother-in-law in the United States, was laid
off from work. He was an engineer for Motorola, a reputable electronic
gadgets (mobile phone) manufacturer. He was summarily terminated from
employment after his many years of productive and loyal service to the
company. He was principally responsible for over a hundred patents where
his technical competence was put to good use by the product development
team of Motorola. Already in his 50s when he was let go, Tom had to move
out of state, from Florida to Texas, so he can be gainfully employed.

Only after a few years with Dell, another reputable electronics company,
Tom was again laid off. With debts to pay, as well as the responsibility
to financially shoulder his children's college education, Tom persevered
and never wavered. He is now employed, though in a company not as big as
Motorola or Dell.

<th>One of the Instagram ads for Extend Fertility, a New York–based
egg-freezing service for women, presents two images. First, there’s a
hand with freshly manicured nails, followed by a sassy pink cartoon of a
human egg with big eyes and long lashes. “If you can afford this,” text
reads above the nails, “you can afford this,” referring to the cartoon egg.

CA-48: Former OCGOP Chairman Scott Baugh won’t challenge Rep. Harley
Rouda (D) in 2020. He came in fourth in the June top-two primary in 2018
when he challenged 15-term Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R), “trailing Rouda,
the race’s eventual winner, by only 2,585 votes.” Baugh said “the timing
and circumstances aren’t right” for a run, but declined to say why.

“Baugh, who served in the state Assembly from 1995 to 2000, said he’ll
spend the next couple years trying to grow business at his law firm and
travel with his family.” He did not rule out another congressional run
in another cycle. (Orange County

President Trump “faces formidable obstacles in his bid for re-election,”
according to a new NBC/WSJ poll (Feb 24-27th, 900 RV’s, +/- 3.3%).

“Just four in 10 voters say they would re-elect him next year; 58% don’t
think he’s been honest and truthful regarding the Russia probe; and 60%
disapprove of his recent national emergency declaration to build a
border wall.”

Credit cards are considered both as a boon and a curse in this
*millennial* era. Having a credit card can prove to be financially
helpful. However, if it is not used wisely, it can rake up debt along
with additional charges that can affect your financial portfolio. Credit
card activities such as repayment of credit form a significant part of
one's credit score and help an individual build his/her CIBIL score.
CIBIL score helps in getting bank loans and bigger credit with ease.
However, what most people ignore is that credit cards do not come for
free. There are hidden charges on your credit card that banks generally
do not mention. Experts suggest these little-known charges need to be
understood to avoid penalties, excess payment charges, and heavy
interest rates later.

Find out some of the different charges that are applicable to your
credit card:

Student loan debt is forcing young Americans to put off major life
milestones, including marriage, home ownership and parenthood.

That’s according to a
Bankrate[https://www.bankrate.com/loans/student-loans/student-loans-survey-february-2019/]
survey on student loan debt. The survey was done in February and had a
total sample size of 3,885 U.S. adults, per Bankrate.

President Donald Trump clearly thinks he has a winning argument against
Democrats in 2020 and it comes straight out of his Baby Boomer childhood.

Trump and other Republicans have spent the past few weeks arguing that
Democrats would rob Americans of consumer comforts like cars and
hamburgers, using a definition of socialism that borrows from a time
when that ideology -- in the form of communism -- posed an actual
existential threat in a nuclear standoff with the Soviet Union.

Business Week -- Veridium, a leading developer of user-centric
authentication solutions, announced the findings of its Biometric
Consumer Sentiment Survey of more than 1,000 U.S. adults who have
experience using biometrics to log into their accounts. The survey
reveals an increased appetite for the technology, with 70 percent of
respondents reporting that they would like to expand the use of
biometric authentication into the workplace. Consumers cited speed (35
percent), security (31 percent) and not having to remember passwords (33
percent) as the primary reasons for liking biometric authentication.

*millennial* and sub-*millennial* climate variability during past low
eccentricity interglacials similar to the Holocene is important for
forecasting the evolution of climate and natural variability. The Ideate
section (Montalbano Jonico, Southern Italy) studied here provides one of
the best records of MIS 19c, the closest orbital analog to the Holocene."

Gone are the halcyon days of puffing away behind the bike sheds in sixth
form. Ministers are reportedly considering raising the legal smoking age
from 18 to 21 following the release of a report by a cross-party group
of MPs.

Reading their recommendations, you’d be forgiven for thinking they were
seeking to protect winsome 12-year-olds from the dangers of tobacco.
Except these young people are not children. A 20-year-old is meant to be
an adult.

Millennials like me are being credited with soaring sales of the
pendulous blooms. It’s one of the ways we can convince ourselves we are
in control of our lives

One of the hardest things about being a *millennial* is that when you
kill something, like doorbells or fabric
softener[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/01/dont-worry-we-millennials-dont-need-living-rooms-anyway],
people won’t stop banging on about it – yet when you bring something
back, you don’t get so much as a thank you. So it is cheering that the
Royal Horticultural Society has publicised the part we have reportedly
played in the resurgence of hanging baskets.

I went to visit a friend last weekend. She's just moved into a new flat
in Kentish Town in northwest London and had invited a few of us over to
see it. We did the usual: brief tour; a bottle of wine; some dinner. And
then we were off to find the local boozer. She's 23, I'm 27, the rest of
us somewhere in between, but we all had the same thing in mind: what
better way to spend a Saturday evening than with a few pints at the pub?
( And an excellent one at that, we
discovered[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/food-and-drink/pubs-and-bars/pineapple-london-nw5-pub-review/]
).

It was cosy, relatively affordable – for London – the atmosphere
buzzing, the soundtrack terrific. At least half the clientele were
millennials (members of what is also called Generation Y, roughly aged
between 22 and 37). The pub was full, as was every other watering hole
in the vicinity – and there are countless in that particular corner of
of the capital.

There was a moment during Michael Cohen's testimony about his 10-year
employment with President Trump that made my blood boil.

It wasn't what the former personal attorney for Trump said but what a
white congressman implied, which was that in no way would a black person
ever work for a known racist.

Nine Entertainment has backed calls for the ACCC to patrol digital
giants Google and Facebook, as well as new rules for Australian media
businesses to retain control of their own content.

The company, which now owns all of the media properties formerly owned
by Fairfax including The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, said the
market dominance of Google and Facebook meant regulatory intervention
was required to ensure publications and their journalists are adequately
paid for content.

Move over, millennials, there's a new kid looming on the legal beat.

Seemingly born with smartphones in hand, Generation Z is a generation of
digital natives. Its members grew up alongside the internet, and
technology has been a part of their lives from the very beginning. They
may share some characteristics with their *millennial* counterparts,
including a commitment to social justice, but the next crop of lawyers
will present unique challenges for their future employers. With the
oldest members of Generation Z currently making their way through law
school, life in Big Law is on the horizon. Are law firms ready?

As of the morning of Feb. 28, about 14 apartments were leased out in the
newly completed Vantage on the Park near downtown Milwaukee.

The tenants already run the gamut in terms of age, said Michael Klein,
president at Klein Development. There are older couples moving to the
downtown area after selling houses in Shorewood and Whitefish Bay, and
young professionals, Klein said.

The Children's Place is buying the rights to the Gymboree and Crazy 8
brands from bankrupt clothing retailer Gymboree Group for $76 million,
and Gap Inc. is shelling out $35 million for the company's upscale Janie
and Jack line and other assets. The results of an auction for Gymboree's
assets were
released[https://pdf.inforuptcy.com/pacer/vaebke/700227/dockets/455.00000/1-138C9710-3CAF-11E9-A36D-ABC6ECB863A2?mod=article_inline]
Saturday by the bankruptcy court of the eastern district of Virginia,
Richmond division. The court still needs to approve both transactions.

The Children's Place will also "take over a contract with
Singapore-based Zeavion Holding. In 2016, Zeavion acquired the
retailer's Gymboree Play & Music business, which operates
independently,"

From preadolescent my parents took me to very strange things, the same
to watch movies that were programmed for other ages (I still do not
recover from Canoa) that to spiritualist sessions of Latin American folk
music and, of course, to see works in the old building of Mascarones
where the band of Cleta made his own. There I met the work,
contestataria and provocative, called The puppet, created by the
well-known Enrique Cisneros, better known as El Llanero Solitito, which
was publicly left, when it was not as easy as demanding counterweights.

Today, *millennial* friends who do meme activism, maybe they will accuse
you of being a fifí or a conservative, but in the old days they just
pushed you to Tlaxcoaque or some military camp where the unspeakable
happened.

He says the main reason why, is inventory.

Much of your focus will be on creating a bedroom that fits the bill

As our collective thirst for photo-ready interiors is baited on
Instagram and Pinterest, so is it quenched by the myriad design hotels
and members clubs materialising across the globe. From the international
Hoxton chain to largely *millennial* pink, velvet-centricindependent
joints, the modern western metropolis cannot compete in the hospitality
sector without such spaces.

Britons are working longer hours than ever before, but does it pay? The
latest data from the Office for National Statistics shows there are now
more people in work than ever and average weekly earnings in real terms
are on the up.

However, we are working 30 minutes more a week than a decade
ago[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/02/20/victim-presenteeism/] .
On top of this we are putting in more than 17 unpaid hours a week,
according to Maxis Global Benefits, a network of insurers, as
"presenteeism" is on the rise.

shopping center.

next to Interstate 75 to build a 315-unit apartment community. The
company said the units will have granite counter tops, stainless steel
appliances and a mix of vinyl-plank wood and carpet flooring. The
complex will have 12 buildings anchored by a 2.5-acre park. Amenities
for the complex call for a fitness center, swimming pool and deck and a
clubhouse.

Love it or loathe it, Nineties style footwear is going to be huge this
year, says KATIE WRIGHT

IT WAS bound to happen eventually. With the return of just about every
Nineties trend - from crop tops and chokers, to bucket hats and
backpacks - it was only a matter of time before square-toed shoes
stomped back into fashion.
