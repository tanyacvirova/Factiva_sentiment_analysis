On your first day at a new job, do you: a) drink an Ensure and hang up
photos of your grandchildren while sitting quietly at your desk awaiting
instruction; b) arrive at work before the boss, in order to make a good
impression, but have difficulty figuring out how to turn on your
computer; c) wear a Sonic Youth T-shirt under your suit, kicking
yourself for working for “the man”; d) send a picture of your new
participation trophies to the group text; or e) FaceTime in from your
couch while recording the meeting to upload to TikTok later? Answer
honestly: Your response will help your workplace determine which
generation you’re from, what sort of worker you might be and how to get
you in the door at the company.

*HD* 	Authentic Brands Group sees revitalizing Forever 21 as its gateway

When Forever 21 went bankrupt at the end of 2019, it was clear what the
issues[https://www.glossy.co/fashion/the-odds-are-not-in-their-favor-forever-21s-chances-at-a-post-bankruptcy-future]
were: The company had over-extended itself to 800 stores without the
foot traffic and revenue to support them. But Authentic Brands Group,
which just acquired the company in a joint venture with Simon Property
Group and Brookfield Property Partners, has a plan in place to turn
things around.

A representative for ABG said there are two main priorities for
revitalizing Forever 21: restructuring the brand’s brick-and-mortar
footprint and cleaning up its supply chain. The company is first
focusing on revamping Forever 21’s store investment, potentially by
switching from an owned store model to something like a franchise model,
where each store is licensed out to an individual owner.

On July 16, 1999, a single-engine Piper plane plunged into the Atlantic
not far off Martha’s Vineyard. Five days later, three bodies were pulled
from the water. The pilot was John F. Kennedy Jr. and the passengers
were his wife, Carolyn, and her sister, Lauren. The three had been on
their way to the wedding of John’s cousin, Rory Kennedy.

Monthly dose of
laughter[https://www.namibiansun.com/news/monthly-dose-of-laughter2020-02-21/]Second
installment promises to be bigger and better Nam Comedy Circle at the
Hilton Hotel's Kalabar has since its inception assumed something of a
cult status. The last Wednesday of the month is comedy time again! Five
comedians of repute – Taap The Guy, Cassie Jessica, Kris With A K, Erich
Nepembe and Joh White – will set the Hilton Hotel's Kalabar alight with
laughter.

Jessica is the new kid on the block, who only recently started making a
name for herself on the live comedy circuit. She comes across as a
go-getter, a *millennial* with a mission who does not shy away from real
or imagined taboos within her community. On stage, she bubbles like a
fountain, releasing bursts of comedy in her vernacular, Oshiwambo, which
she mixes with English to get the message across. She can further be
described as a refreshing new character on the local comedy scene.

Addressing a large audience of English-speaking Israelis on Monday, Blue
and White Party leader Benny
Gantz[https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/Anglos-flock-to-hear-Blue-and-White-heads-Benny-Gantz-Yair-Lapid-617972]
made a promise that he cannot possibly keep. This isn’t what made his
vow laughable, however. It’s par for political candidates to give
utopian guarantees to prospective voters, particularly during the final
countdown to an election – or, in this case, the last days leading up to
a third round of Knesset elections on March 2, which are likely to
result in the same impasse as the previous two.

MEXICO CITY, February 20.- The *millennial* generation is at its highest
and increasingly encompasses land in various aspects of the national
sphere. One of them is the real estate sector, because for this year
more than half of the homebuyers are expected to belong to this age group.

Vivanuncios, eBay's real estate portal, developed research on
millennials' participation in the purchase of living properties, the
result of which was that over the next few years they will be the main
buyers of real estate in Mexico. By 2020 alone, 63% of those who buy a
home will be of this generation.

Sutton’s got a wedding to plan but she’s feeling the pressure. In this
EXCLUSIVE preview of the Feb. 20 episode, Sutton vents a little to
Oliver and wishes Richard was with her to help.

While Oliver doesn’t think it gets any better than getting paid to plan
your own wedding, Sutton is feeling the stress in this EXCLUSIVE preview
of the Feb. 20 episode of The Bold Type. “I do wish Richard was here,
though,” Sutton tells Oliver. “It is our wedding.” Planning a wedding is
hard for any bride to take on without her groom by her side.

Retirement is an issue that we Mexicans should know since we started our
working life, but few know the requirements and steps to take to obtain it.

First of all, the pension must be differentiated from the pension,
because terms are often misused as if they were synonymous and there is
nothing further from reality.

There is plenty of beauty in Jane Austen's most recent adaptation of
Jane Austen's "Emma," from her campira naian palaces with her art-filled
galleries and manicured gardens, to the exquisitely detailed costumes
(with those feathered headdresses!) to star Anya Taylor-Joy, whose
porcelain skin and blonde curls look like they came from a Botticelli
painting.

But what is that red that we see emerging in an unsightly nose-like
during a romantic climatic scene? Is Emma having a nosebleed in the
middle of her pristine beauty?

HE may see himself as the future of music but Harry Styles’ stage
outfits come from just One Direction – the past.

At the Brit Awards on Tuesday, the singer, 26, wore a yellow suit by
designer Marc Jacobs. But it got us thinking that we’d seen it before –
on Rolling Stones star Mick Jagger in the 1970s.

When Wakefield Pork employees were recently asked to describe in one
word what it's like to work for the Gaylord, Minn.-based producer, the
word that came to mind most often from their 275 employees was "family."

Mary Langhorst, along with her husband, Steve, and son, Lincoln, owns
Wakefield Pork, which cares for 55,000 sows and markets more than 1.4
million hogs each year. She acknowledges the pork production system has
been able to retain a strong, talented base of employees over the years.

Brands are constantly fighting for our attention. The winners understand
that aesthetics alone won't cut it. They invest in more than just visual
assets, and build equity through other human senses.

Sight. Sight is a staple for any major brand, but the best brands push
past their primary touchpoint, typically their product, and brand more
of the customer journey with distinctive visual cues.

They are unstructured but influence each other via the Internet: racists
and supremacists from around the world expand their actions and pose a
growing threat to their heroes and martyrs.

The double shooting that caused nine deaths in Hanau, Germany, and which
appears directly related to "xenophobic motivations," occurs after a
long list of murderous acts committed in the West by individuals seeking
the defense of the "white race," to which threatened by migration,
globalization and Islam.

If there's one thing that characterizes the much-lied, hyper analyzed
*millennial* generation, it's that it's been marked by an absolute
immersion in social media, especially through Instagram, and that it
feels an unstoppable attraction for nostalgia. That, in part, is what
marks the imaginary of Colectivo Da Silva, a ensemble reminiscent of a
boy band of the 90s in the way he dresses and with his poses; and that
through a synthesized pop with a naif style and large doses of bad
slime, they reflect on the day-to-day life of a young man of his time.
They have just been confirmed at Bilbao BBK Live and can also be seen at
a festival in Low, Benidorm.

INTERNATIONAL lovers face all kinds of challenges on TLC's "90 Day
FiancÃ©." Besides having to tie the knot in just three months so they
can live together, couples confront age differences, racial tensions,
language barriers - and, as of this weekend, sexuality.

On Sunday, the franchise's spinoff, "90 Day FiancÃ©: Before the 90
Days," introduces the series' first-ever same-sex couple: Erika Owens,
from Australia, and Yonkers resident Stephanie Matto. "Before the 90
Days" focuses on couples in the early stages of cross-border dating.

Colombians who decide to save usually start this process in February,
which makes this month the period of the year in which consumers save
the most. That's one of the findings from a study by Fincomercio,
analyzing growth in savings plans throughout the year. For example, when
comparing February 2018 to the same period in 2019, last year's savings
growth was 12%. The analysis of the data confirmed that this trend has
continued for the last 3 years, with cumulative growth of 21% per year.
According to Fincomercio partners, the cause of the good savings
dynamics in the second month of the year is that in January they pay the
debts generated by Christmas expenses and in February begin with the
fulfillment of their goals of the year. According to user responses, the
three most common reasons for saving are home buying, traveling, and
paying for study-related responsibilities.

QUEEN Elizabeth II had "the last laugh" over Meghan Markle and Prince
Harry's decision to step down after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex made
a "fundamental mistake", commentator Rowan Dean claimed.

Queen Elizabeth II is believed to have warned Meghan Markle and Prince
Harry they will not be allowed to use the Sussex Royal brand to launch
their new foundation after they step down from their senior positions in
the Royal Family in March. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were expected
to use the Sussex Royal brand to conduct their business after investing
time in building their social media presence under the royal banner and
launching a new Sussex Royal website. Sky News AU host and commentator
Rowan Dean praised the Queen for how she managed Harry and Meghan's
departure as he warned the couple a "fundamental mistake" marred their
attempt for a clean break from the family.

Royal Family's millenial members. The couple's ceremony takes place in
May, and could see a cast of the Royal Family's youngest constituents
involved.

Just as we fill up on empty calories throughout the day, we load our
shopping carts full of useless junk. Some days, to be sure, we do better
than others.

But what if a savings tool could keep our head in the game – and our
money in our bank accounts – just a bit longer?

*Millennial* investors have shorter time horizons than ever before, as
apps allow them to act first and think later, without having a human to
bounce their ideas off of.

The final part of our inaugural Selector Tapes series shines a light on
how generational shifts in how we interact with technology could have
major implications for investment.

Young employees now entering their prime working years are so far
proving as loyal to employers as the generation before them, despite a
hot job market.

In January 2018, 70% of workers between the ages of 22 and 37, commonly
known as the *millennial* generation, had worked for their current
employer for 13 months or more, according to an analysis of federal data
by the Pew Research Center. By comparison, that number was 69% for
workers who were in the same age group in 2002 and are known as
Generation X.

'How do you play a guy - a guy similar to those who we see in power
today - who is racist, homophobic, misogynistic, arrogant, narcissistic,
entitled and supremely ignorant, in a way that is both funny and
compassionate?" Well, you could do a lot worse than getting the guy
posing the question to play him.

fashionable again

Bread, pasta, rice - no, this is not a list of "banned foods" you should
have eliminated from your diet, it's all the carbs making a 2020
comeback. Waitrose is reporting a bread bounce - sales of sourdough are
up by 30 per cent in three years - and searches for potatoes are up 12
per cent, too.

TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - The Indonesian Solidarity Party (PSI) deputy
secretary-general, Danik Eka Rahmaningtiyas, said that a lot of her
party’s works were inspired by Basuki Tjahaja Purnama (BTP) or
familiarly called Ahok.

“In Jakarta, PSI is striving to save the city's budget, ensuring that no
public money is corrupted or wasted. As I recall, that’s what you [Ahok]
fight for in Jakarta. Isn’t it right, Pak?” said Danik, mentioning Ahok
in a video sent by the PSI’s sec-gen Raja Juli Antoni to Tempo on
Wednesday, February 19. Tempo has obtained the permit to quote the video
footage.

It's Valentine's eve, and Philip Cruz and Carlos Chan are looking
pleased as they survey the early-evening crowd that is starting to
stream into their Bloom Caf + Bar, in that high-traffic corner of
Greenbelt 2 where Nuvo bar used to be.

There was some slowdown in business just days prior, on their fourth
week of soft operations, owing to the COVID-19 scare, construction and
mining magnate Cruz tells us. "But that looks to be over now. Only those
in that area made reservations," he said, pointing to a large group of
Japanese expats on the mezzanine. "Everyone else is walk-in."

Sunny Leone walked the ramp for designer Swapnil Shinde on Day 1 of
Lakmé Fashion Week Summer/Resort 2020. In a Cinderella printed tee with
an oversized jacket and knee-high boots, Sunny looked every bit a

after 5 years. The Telegraph caught up with Sunny after the show...

Your outfit for Swapnil Shinde has a Disney princess on it. How would

Celebrity twinning fashion moments have become a common thing in B-town.
Taking inspiration from different designers or opting for one is the
latest trend. Not only the actors but also the stylists are getting
influenced these days, trying to recreate the best looks for their
stars. However, their uncanny resemblances of fashion fads later give
rise to many comparisons. The recent face-off was between Ananya Panday
and Sara Ali Khan who were spotted wearing a pretty 3D ensemble at
different times.Ananya was seen dressed in a beautiful lavender hue 3D
bustier dress at the Femina Beauty Awards last night. The strapless
dress featured silver embellishments in bodice while the latter was
filled with attractive striped 3D fabrication. She finished her dazzling
by accessorising with diamond-studded earrings and tied her hair up in a
sleek ponytail. The fuschia eyeshadow, and nude-toned lipstick
complimented the entire look.

Imtiaz Ali's latest directorial 'Love Aaj Kal', which starred popular
*millennial* stars Sara Ali Khan and Kartik Aaryan, did not live up to
the buzz that was created ahead of the release. Senior trade expert
Taran Adarsh, in an exclusive interview with ETimes, opened up about the
film's box office debacle. From Sara-Kartik's upcoming projects to
comparing both the 'Love Aaj Kal' films, here are the answers to all the
questions about the film's box office rejection.Sharing his thoughts
about the film witnessing a dip in collections and it impacts on
Sara-Kartik upcoming projects, Adarsh said, "Well, I feel that 'Love Aaj
Kal' has been rejected by the audience. Kartik had a couple of hits in
the past while Sara, on the other hand, had 'Kedarnath' and 'Simmba'
which were both hits, so that has come to their fault."Furthermore, he
added, "Having said that I would also like to add that the upcoming
releases of Kartik as well as Sara are interesting and big films.

Sara Ali Khan marked her big Bollywood debut in 2018 with the film
'Kedarnath' and since then there was no looking back for the young
actress. However recently while talking about the early days on a web
show, she remembered an incident when she wanted to escape a meeting by
faking a cardiac arrest. But her mum Amrita Singh didn't give her
permission.While speaking on the talk show the *millennial* actress said
there was this one time. She did not elaborate much about the scene but
came to the point and shared that she went to the restroom with her
phone and told her mom, 'Look, I know that we are all professional and
we should be thankful for these opportunities. But can I pretend to have
a cardiac arrest? Is that allowed?'. Quickly her mother replied no, so
she asked, whether she can faint?

From colas and toothpaste to travel and fashion, the actor has become
the go-to endorser for brands of all shades

What does a 60-plus brand do when it needs to infuse fresh energy into
its promise? Or a youthful cola brand look for when it needs to ratchet
up the engagement on video-sharing platforms, or how does a stodgy
electrical goods maker find a *millennial* connection? Increasingly,
over the past year and more, brands across disparate categories and
target audiences, have chosen actor Alia Bhatt for the job.

NINE years on from the ­release of Friday, the viral earworm that in
many ways ­defined *millennial* meme ­culture, singer Rebecca Black has
written a heartbreaking post in which she detailed the mental health
struggles she endured after she became the butt of an internet joke
which she says destroyed her early reputation as a singer.

“Nine years ago today a music video for a song called Friday was
uploaded to the ­internet,” she wrote.

The value public-sector employees place on retiree health and pension
benefits is worth the effort of finding solutions to keep offering them.

Roughly half of public-sector employees surveyed (46%) are worried that
the health care benefits they were promised in retirement will evaporate
when they need them most, according to the 2020 Keeping Benefit Promises
Study by Willis Towers Watson.

(GlobeNewswire) - The Tylt, a digital media company that helps brands
navigate consumer sentiment, trends, and interests, has published its
first comprehensive consumer opinion and insights report Clothespin
Shopping: How the Decline of Trust Among Gen Z and Millennials Leaves
Them Looking For a Brand Fandom. The study identifies the burgeoning and
powerful cohort of young consumers as The Clothespin Generation, who
currently hold their nose and buy from brands that do not align with
their social consciousness, due to lack of optionsbut not for long. As
new competitors rise up and meet these shoppers expectations, they will
cancel their relationship with many of todays brands forever.

The study leverages The Tylts proprietary data and sentiment analysis,
combined with third-party research, and keen insights from brand
leaders, to underscore the emerging consumer narrative on Gen Z and
Millennials.

An advert on the metro in Paris caught my eye recently.

In large orange letters, the promotion for a French design and visual
communication school read: "My son, you'll be a banker." The word
"banker" was crossed out, made to look like spontaneous graffiti, and
"web designer" was scrawled underneath.

The final scene of Hulu’s High Fidelity seems poised to play out a
classic rom-com moment: The lonely record-store owner Robin, a.k.a.
“Rob” (played by Zoë Kravitz), shows up at the apartment of her love
interest, Clyde (Jake Lacy), who’s been avoiding her calls since a
falling-out a few episodes back. The inevitable seems to be coming:
She’ll confess her feelings, he’ll accept them, and they’ll be together.

But none of that happens. She doesn’t propose a relationship—just a
friendship. “Look, I’ve been figuring out a lot of stuff, I think,” she
says. “Stuff like how to stop living in the past and how to stop taking
shit for granted and people for granted and how to stop being such an
asshole. I was hoping that we could just, you know, start fresh.” He
turns her down, at first, but eventually concedes there’s a slim chance
they could be friends again.

Rare would be medieval monastery that did not have in its library a copy
of the Naturalis History of Pliny the Elder (23-79), perhaps the first
encyclopedia of all time. Pliny the Elder was only old compared to his
nephew, Pliny the Younger, because two millennia later those age
differences impress rather little and, unlike the nephew, Uncle Pliny
was an innovator in Nero's Rome, not as torpedoasist as Ne himself more
influential in the long run, as evidenced by its *millennial* impact on
agriculture.

With brassy quips and state-centric memes, @NJGov is trying to burnish
New Jersey’s much-maligned reputation.

The two women who run New Jersey’s official state Twitter account, Megan
Coyne and Pearl Gabel, know all about the reputation their home state
has developed over decades.

The 1.6-million-square-foot former Montgomery Ward catalog house at 600
W. Chicago Ave. in Chicago was recently renovated at a reported cost of
around $20 million by the Sterling Bay real estate development firm, a
project that included the addition of a retail/dining mix called
Farehouse Market operated by local food service management company Quest
Food Management
Services[https://www.food-management.com/top-50-contract-companies/2019-fm-top-50-33-quest-food-management-services].

The more than a dozen tenants in the building include online deal vendor
Groupon, Big Ten Network, chocolate/cocoa manufacturer Barry Callebaut,
Echo Global Logistics, healthcare firm Tempus and Jump Trading. The
total building population is around 7,500, and since the surrounding
area has scant dining resources, the onsite B&I dining mix is a critical
component of tenant services.

While 2019 was a seller's market, for this year there are several trends
that support a shift toward the buyer. At the same time, there are many
issues still overhanging from last year that push the needle towards the
seller.

While mortgage rates ended 2019 lower, home inventory was restricted,
which contributed to home values appreciating in many U.S. metros. That
made for a challenging environment for buyers.
