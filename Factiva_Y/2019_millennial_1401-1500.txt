New Delhi: Korean giant Samsung has worked out fresh strategies to beat
the steep competition from the Chinese brands in India, said DJ Koh,
global president of $100-billion IT and mobile communications division
of the company. While in China, the company has been relegated to
fringes, in India, Samsung continues to be a behemoth, with revenue
leadership in mobile devices, though it has lost the volume game to
China’s Xiaomi.Despite a renewed thrust with fresh products and new
technologies, there is no scope for complacency, Koh said. “If we take a
nap, we will die. I don’t want to die,” he said with a smile.

Indian women have outpaced their male counterparts when it comes to
taking loans from formal sources like banks and NBFCs. A study by credit
bureau TransUnion CIBIL shows that India has witnessed a 48% growth in
successful credit applications among women borrowers between 2015 and
2018. In comparison, the growth among male borrowers is slower at 35%.
The data also reveals that 8.6 million new –to-credit women borrowers
are opening new loan accounts per year, and 66% of these women are from
five states: Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and
Karnataka.“The increase in credit demand and uptake by women is an
opportunity for the credit industry to customize products and services
that can cater better to the financial requirements of women borrowers.
“ said Harshala Chandorkar, COO, TransUnion CIBIL.

India, March 8 -- Women are often stereotyped and associated to being
"emotional."

On International Women's Day, Kara Rivers, programme manager of Snapchat

self-expression, making it a place to portray one's true self.

MELBOURNE’S water storage levels are almost half-empty and will trigger
an expensive desalination plant order likely to cost at least $70 million.

A record water order of 100 billion litres is firming after a dry
summer, with concerns about poor dam inflows that have dropped to only 5
per cent above average *millennial* drought inflows.

Joanna Bassett is an associate at Taylor Wessing

When future generations reflect on the architecture of the early-21st
century, it will likely be seen as the age of the skyscraper. Huge
statements of wealth and power are positioned throughout major cities
across the globe. These were constructed to cement their owner's legacy,
much as the pyramids and the Taj Mahal were. But what our successors
won't see are the eclectic structures that occupied the footprint of
these buildings for a few short years, which perhaps offer a more honest
reflection of our time.

The song — catchy, peppy, and familiar — is the ideal soundtrack for a
credit card commercial targeting young professionals. We see them
bowling and buzzing on go-karts, smiling in a whirl of *millennial*
exuberance and gleeful consumerism.

But the song in the Capital One credit card commercial is Michael
Jackson's “Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough," and when I saw the
commercial last week I didn't think, “I want that credit card so I can
go bowling." Instead, I felt a chill.

'We have an army," Senator Edward J. Markey declared during a meeting
with the Globe's editorial board last month as he professed his faith in
the Green New Deal.

“There's a green generation out there," he stressed, touting the merits
of the resolution he announced alongside rising congressional star
Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

young woman from a working-class Ghanaian family find common ground with
her reverse mentee, global managing partner Andrew Ballheimer?

While actors are often the focus of Equity fair pay campaigns, designers
face similarly poor conditions and crippling overheads. Lighting
designer Robbie Butler says it's time to join a union and demand higher fees

We need to talk about money. For a while, I've been wanting to scream my
lungs out about low fees - and even apparently fair fees - offered to
designers and technicians, who have frequently been hesitant to speak up
for fear of being blacklisted as troublemakers. But Shona McCarthy's
recent comment about the impossibilities of "fair pay" on the Edinburgh
Festival Fringe was the straw that broke the camel's back.

Another reason not to work on Wall Street

Occasionally, I look at my payslip and wonder why I don’t work at
Goldman Sachs. Then I look at the news, and remember that there are so
many good reasons. This week’s revelation is that Goldman — the famously
uptight Wall Street bastion — will allow staff to wear casual clothes
sometimes. Or as the bank’s leadership put it: “we believe this is the
right time to move to a firmwide flexible dress code”.

You're one of my tribe and it's dwindling. A joke going around is that

SAN FRANCISCO — Big wealth doesn’t come in monthly paychecks. It comes
when a start-up goes public, transforming hypothetical money into
extremely real money. This year — with Uber, Lyft, Slack, Postmates,
Pinterest and Airbnb all hoping to enter the public markets — there’s
going to be a lot of it in the Bay Area.

Estimates of Uber’s
value[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/03/technology/uber-ipo-legal-issues.html]
on the market have been as high as $120 billion. Airbnb was most
recently valued at $31 billion, with Lyft and Pinterest around $15
billion and $12 billion. It’s anyone’s guess what prices these companies
actually will command once they go public, but even conservative
estimates predict hundreds of billions of dollars will flood into town
in the next year, creating thousands of new millionaires. It’s hard to
imagine more money in San Francisco, but the city’s residents now need
to start trying.

When it comes to sustainability and transparency, the fashion industry
has taken its share of hits.

While older generations may not have known about, or paid attention to,
issues like factory conditions, processing pollution, or the
decomposition time for synthetic fibers, younger generations are taking
note. Now, the conversations that were started by millennials are being
taken up and acted on by Gen Z.

At some point during the winter break last month, someone covered the
playground of a public school in the Rego Park section of Queens with
swastikas and other anti-Semitic sentiments. Either poor spellers or
unfamiliar with the exact phrasing of the Nazi salute, whoever was
responsible inscribed the words “Hail Hiter” on the ground in chalk.

Chairwoman Waters, Ranking Member McHenry, Members of the Committee,
thank you for the opportunity to testify today.

In March of 2011, I had the honor of joining the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau, and that is where I would like to start today--by
recalling what this country looked like in 2011. Because if we are to
have any meaningful discussion around the mission and future of the
Bureau, it is important to recall what people's lives looked like--what
this nation looked like--as the CFPB opened its doors.

FT'S LEXBoring old banks have the edgeFinance workers adore technology
when it makes their jobs easier. They like it less if it takes their
jobs away. For a while, fintechs threatened to do that. Venture
investors pumped billions of dollars into the nascent sector. But UK
online bank Revolut has shown newbies can have some old-world
problems.The first is regulation. Revolut has attracted the attention of
UK watchdogs. The fact that Revolut is licensed by the Bank of Lithuania
may give some customers pause for thought. It offers services in the UK
using an e-banking licence, which allows it to act more as a payment
system than a full-service bank. Some other neo-banks, such as Monzo and
OakNorth, have UK banking licences with full depositor safeguards.Any
cost savings for Revolut have not helped the business swiftly turn a
profit. The group reported a & xA3;14.8m loss at the end of 2017, when
it had 1-million customers. That is fair enough.

The overcrowded Democratic field is finally starting to shrink. Already
this week, Michael Bloomberg, Eric Holder, and Jeff Merkley have
announced they won’t run for president. Of those, only Bloomberg was a
real surprise. Then came the big one: On Thursday, Sherrod Brown
announced he wouldn’t run either.

Brown’s choice followed a decisive reelection campaign in November, and
then a widely publicized “Dignity of Work” barnstorming tour of the
early primary and caucus states. The senator from Ohio acknowledged he
was thinking hard about running. But he told America’s best-named
newspaper, the Youngstown Vindicator, that he decided the Senate was the
best place for his message.

Time — and a $1 million nest egg — will do the hard work

At the age of 24, I woke up to find $2.26 in my bank account. I was
unemployed and living back at home with my parents. They in turn were in
their mid-50s and chasing a far-off retirement, like most of their
friends. That morning, I decided to pursue retirement on my own terms —
terms that meant not waiting until I was 65, 60, or even 55.

CITY OF MEXICO (Expansion). The employment penalty linked to maternity
increased 34.8% in the last decade in the world, says the report 'A
decisive step towards gender equality', presented by the International
Labor Organization (ILO). "Mothers of young children face, in
particular, a penalty in leadership positions. They register the lowest
rates of participation in the managerial positions, only 25.1% of the
personnel (in these functions) are women with children under 6 years of
age, "the document points out. For Mónica Flores Barragán, president of
ManpowerGroup Latin America, the problem begins with the fact that
organizations do not develop training strategies and sponsor activities
aimed at women reaching leadership positions. "Only 2% of organizations
offer that opportunity," he says.

ShareSubscribeTweet Hawaii policymakers might not have noticed, but
millennials across the country are moving to the suburbs, where housing
is less expensive.

Not surprisingly, those suburbs generally are not in Hawaii, so if we
want to make it possible for our own younger generation to stay in the
islands, then we, too, will need to create the conditions that allow for
more suburban housing. As Grassroot Scholar Randal O’Toole has written,
this means building “out,” not “up.”

Anti-Semitism -- the prejudice that refuses to die -- has once again
burst onto the global scene, and Americans are struggling to figure out
what to do about it. The hatred may be ancient, but the response so far
in the United States has been very much of our time: dominated by
partisan finger-pointing, defensive recriminations and accusations that
only the other party is to blame.

Judging by how intensely Republicans and Democrats reject anti-Semitism
by members of the opposite party, they should be able to agree on a
common approach to tackling a problem that is already growing at an
exponential rate[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46439194] in
Europe and has a *millennial* history of devastating societies that let
it fester.

More than 56,700 Americans are expected to be diagnosed with pancreatic
cancer like the ‘Jeopardy’ host this year — and their odds often aren’t good

This form of cancer is the third deadliest in the U.S., and is expected
to kill approximately 45,750 Americans this year because it is so
difficult to detect early.

When actress Halle Berry netted the best actress award at the 2002
Oscars she dedicated her gong to "every nameless, faceless woman of colour".

Being both Caucasian and female I could, of course, have taken huge
offence at her remarks. Why didn't Berry consider my skin tone (winter
white even after a week in Tenerife) to be part of her politically
correct palate?

TORONTO - One of the fastest-growing demographics in Canada and around
the world has long been ignored by mainstream businesses and
politicians, but that may be about to change.

"Society is geared toward families," says Jean-Pierre Bissonnette, a
52-year-old single medical physicist at the Princess Margaret Hospital
who counts himself as part of a growing cohort of people who choose to
live the single life.

A reader in his mid-70s has asked for some advice on how to get his
spouse to take more of an interest in their finances. “Being three years
older than her, I’ll probably hit the dust first,” he wrote in an
e-mail. “I worry about her complete lack of knowledge about personal
finance, banking, investments, taxes, etc.”

By coincidence, a couple of bloggers have written on this topic
recently. Mark Goodfield of The Blunt Bean Counter offers six
ways[http://www.thebluntbeancounter.com/2019/02/bridging-financial-literacy-gap-with.html]
to improve your spouse’s financial literacy that focus for the most part
on talking about money. Review the family budget together, discuss
annual investment reports and discuss daily financial events, he says.
And make sure your spouse has met your financial adviser, if you have one.

*HD* 	Gregg Araki Wants to Make America Gay Again

The first thing you notice about the filmmaker Gregg Araki is his hands.
It is two weeks before the premiere of his first foray into television,
“Now Apocalypse,” and he’s sitting on the walled-off patio of a
Starbucks in North Hollywood as unseen cars whiz behind him. While he
describes the show as the “culmination of every movie I’ve ever done,”
his legacy is tattooed across his knuckles: “NOW HERE.”

The tattoo is a reference to “Nowhere,” his seminal 1997 portrait of
Gen-Xers raised in the shadow of the H.I.V.-AIDS crisis: having sex,
getting high and getting obliterated by an unexplained reptilian menace.
Films like “The Living End,” “Mysterious Skin” and “Kaboom” further
cemented his preoccupation with, in Araki’s words, “sexually confused
young people” in End Times America.

Don’t blame the denim market for Diesel USA’s trip to bankruptcy court.

Structural shifts in retail, high rents, changing consumer habits and
the convenience of shopping online have left many brick-and-mortar
retailers in bankruptcy — including Sears Corp., Nine West, Charlotte
Russe, David’s Bridal and most recently Payless ShoeSource.

BuzzFeed brought its content to a different format yesterday — not a
podcast or new licensed product line, and no virtual reality. The
digitally native entertainment and news company tackled analog,
publishing a print newspaper for one day only.

BuzzFeed handed out 20,000, 12-page newspapers for free. It included
reviews of noise-canceling headphones, a printed version of a BuzzFeed
quiz and printed screenshots of a gif of Glenn Close's reactions at the
Oscars.

Gaming now makes up 26% of all media consumption hours and is considered
more important by the *millennial* age group of 24-35 rather than
teenagers, according a report by mobile telecoms equipment company Ericsson.

The report said that the future of gaming will be augmented reality (AR)
and the *millennial* generation that grew up with PlayStations and
Xboxes considers gaming to be a far more important aspect of their lives
than teenagers, who only view games as a way to kill time.

How to make a great first impression, from the people in the know

How photogenic is your porch? In the age of Instagram it matters more
than you might think, much to the irritation of residents of Notting
Hill in west London. Bloggers and influencers are queueing to take
fashion-shoot photographs outside the city’s most colourful and
*millennial* pink-painted homes to post on social media.

Household net worth fell in the fourth quarter for the first time in
more than three years after the brief stock-market nosedive to close the
year.

The Federal Reserve on Thursday reported in its financial accounts of
the United States
[https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/current/default.htm]that the
net worth of households and nonprofits fell by $3.73 trillion, or 3.5%,
to $104.33 trillion in the fourth quarter. That’s the first fall since
the 1% decline in the third quarter of 2015, the Fed said.

Inspired by her husband’s porn stash, the artist’s explicit work
horrified galleries and customs officials. Now the world can’t get
enough. We visit her New York studioWarning: adult content

Betty Tompkins sits slumped in her chair, knees wide apart, cheerfully
reading from the phone in her hand with an attitude of scoffing
amusement: “‘The venerable’, ‘the brilliant’, ‘the incomparable’, ‘the
great living legend’ … ” She breaks off to frown and mutter: “How old am
I?” Then she continues: “‘The famous and infamous’, ‘inimitable’,
‘iconic’, ‘pioneering’, ‘mega artist’, ‘the fabulous’, ‘coolest old lady
artist did not come to play.’” She looks up, grins and says: “I’ve been
collecting these.”

The modern manners of sexual fluidity get a rigorous workout in
filmmaker Gregg Araki's series "Now Apocalypse," premiering Sunday on Starz.

It's a half-hour mash-up of *millennial* relationship shenanigans
interrupted by the suggestion that the world will soon be overrun by
libidinous lizard monsters who find humans good, giving and game. At
least, that's what I gather from the five episodes (out of 10) made
available for review.

Having explored the lot of the migrant in his supernatural debut,
Shelley (2016), Iranian-Danish director Ali Abbasi focuses on a customs
officer in Border, a genre-bending hybrid adapted from a short story by
John Ajvide Lindqvist, whose novel, Let the Right One In, was filmed so
evocatively by Tomas Alfredson in 2008. A trans subplot has aroused ire
in certain quarters, but this blend of social critique, mythological
horror and Nordic noir is on much safer ground in its exploration of
otherness, conformity, duty and the crises facing human civilisation.

With her Neanderthalic features, Tina (Eva Melander) stands out from her
colleagues on the customs barrier at an unnamed Swedish port. As the
passengers go by, she scents their fear and her colleagues have come to
trust her instincts, as she stops an underage kid with a bagful of
alcohol and a smug suit (Viktor Åkerblom) trying to smuggle child
pornography into the country on a memory card hidden in his phone.

The first taping for Season 45 of “Austin City Limits” kicked off with a
twang on March 3, as rising country star Kane Brown brought his
radio-friendly voice and talented full band to the Moody Theater stage
at ACL Live. The crowd was equal parts devoted fans and curious
newcomers who had never heard of Brown before, but by the end of the
show, one thing was for sure, no matter who you were: Ladies love Kane
Brown.

The artist had his female admirers jumping out of their seats swaying,
singing, clapping, stomping and even doing a little hip thrusting, as he
crooned perfect country love song after perfect country love song. What
girl doesn’t want to be told she’s better than literal heaven (as Brown
sings on the appropriately titled “Heaven”)?

The customer, a petite European redhead, has just been poured a glass of
Chablis by her nervous waitron. Taking a sip, she says appraisingly,
“It’s like you. Promises a lot, then disappoints.”

The same could be said about “Greta,” a stalker-cum-Bluebeard story with
a twist. The customer happens to be the title character, Greta (Isabelle
Huppert), a sixty-something widow living in Brooklyn. Her server is
Frances (Chloe Grace Moretz), a fresh-faced newbie to the city,
currently sharing a trust-fund loft in Soho with her roomie from Smith,
Erica (Maika Monroe).

MUMBAI: Myntra announces the launch of a wide-ranging content campaign
titled 'Straight Outta Street', aimed at enhancing its position as the
powerhouse and the ultimate destination for contemporary fashion. The
multi-faceted campaign on street fashion in India has just begun with
the launch of a film, which is also the fifth in the Myntra
Unforgettables series that highlights and celebrates people's passion
for fashion.

The campaign is focussed on contemporary street wear, a popular new
phenomenon and a mind-set of many a *millennial*, espoused even by
Bollywood, with the likes of Gully Boy. Hip-hop dancing, rap and street
fashion have come together to create a new identity for teen-agers and
young adults across cities and towns and Myntra has captured this new
spirit through an inspiring video, shot in the heart of Mumbai.

A middle-aged father and his adult daughter sit across a wooden table
from one another near dusk on a late February Friday at a tavern on the
South Side. Their voices are at full throat, amplified by the pints
before them. Fingers wag. Veins tighten in forehead and neck.

The source of their animated discussion is not related to any simmering
familial resentments nor any political tempest du jour. Rather it has to
do with fish sandwiches. Fried fish sandwiches. Because Lent is nigh,
and "The Codfather" is having a sit-down with his top lieutenant.

Most lawyers are familiar with the catch-all term "firm culture," and
the related term "collegial work environment." These phrases, which
appear in nearly every firm's marketing materials, are used to convey
that attorneys at that firm are happy. Individuals within firms,
however, can often have vastly different perceptions of their work
environment depending on a variety of factors, including the
individual's own personality, the geographic location of the firm, the
size of the firm, and the dynamic of a particular department or practice
group, among many other factors. Given these variances, what does the
term "firm culture" mean in practicality?

Barbie turns 60 on Friday. The Mattel fashion icon isn't nearing
retirement, however: She's being strategically reinvented to reflect
today's increasingly diverse world.

diverse Barbie dolls are in. And, accompanied by messaging that promotes
progressive values, the diverse dolls are poised to become central to
the brand's image.
