This is the amuse-bouche." Massimo Bottura arrives in the room in his
chef's whites. "It is most important that you understand this, because
it is talking to you in the beginning and telling you where we are
coming from, where we are going, what to expect." I glance down at the
plate, at its centre what looks like a big yellow snowflake hogging the
light, topped with a quenelle of what might be coffee ice-cream.

"Okay!" Bottura says, pulling up a chair. "My father is from north of
Modena, on the Po River, where the farmers have lots of potatoes and
still fish the local freshwater fish. They fry and preserve them very
aggressively in carpione sauce: vinegar, onion, salt, sugar, herbs. It
was always too heavy, too aggressive, so I've turned it into
[ice-cream]. They originally served these in autumn with crunchy bread.

MILLENNIALS are the worst offenders when it comes to throwing away food,
research suggests.

The report reveals that Australians wasted about $8.9 billion of food
last year, about $890 per household.But it is a significant improvement
on previous years, a reduction of $700 million from 2017 to 2018,
equating to a saving of $160 per household a year. Gen Z and *Gen Y*
were the worst wasters, binning more than $1200 in 2018, while Baby
Boomers binned $430 worth, the survey, commissioned by Rabobank, found.

Unlike earlier generations, for whom owning a home was a major life
goal, accessibility to experiences and a sense of community are more
important than ownership of property for millennials.

Recently, some entrepreneur friends and I were discussing an interesting
advertising campaign that called on millennials to join the British
Army. The posters had generated a lot of buzz on social media, kicking
off countless debates on stereotypes surrounding people in their 20s and
early 30s. "Me me me millennials", "binge gamers", "phone zombies",
"snow flakes", "selfie addicts" - is that how we really see the
millennial generation?

New research has revealed that the younger generation is more likely to
splash out on a new car as their first vehicle than previous generations.

A new survey by Gumtree Cars has found that about 24 per cent of
Millennials bought a new vehicle as their first car. This compares to 15
per cent for Gen X and 14 per cent for *Gen Y*.

*HD* 	Do you have a favourite bank for savings and GICs? Plus the 411 on

A reader asked me recently if I had a preferred bank for parking money
in a savings account or guaranteed investment certificates. Short
answer: no. While I don’t own any GICs, I have savings accounts at five
different banks and have found almost all of them useful in one way or
another.

I have a bunch of accounts at EQ bank because it used to be a high rate
leader and still offers a very good rate of 2.3 per cent. I like their
website – it’s slick and user friendly when used on a smartphone and
desktop, though a bit slow to load on my computer. Alterna Bank pays
2.35 per cent, but has a more dated online interface and an app I’m not
crazy about. Tangerine, now paying 1.25 per cent, is way behind on
rates. But its website is one of the best out there for guiding you
through transactions quickly and clearly.

THE emergence of new technology brought by the Fourth Industrial

a top official of the Bohol Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BCCI) said.

Marietta Gasatan, BCCI vice president for external affairs, said in a
forum organized by state think tank Philippine Institute of Development
Studies (PIDS), that the digital age had provided huge opportunities for
those in the tourism business to expand their markets, enhance customer
satisfaction and improve services.

As the sea breeze swept over the marginal seat of Coogee yesterday,
voters expressed their desire for a breath of fresh air.

It will take just a 2.9 per swing for 32-year-old Labor candidate
Marjorie O'Neill to knock out the Liberal Party's Bruce Notley-Smith,
who has held the seat for eight years. If successful, she will be the
first female member for the electorate.

By Sandeep DuttaOnce upon a time, when the world was gentler and more
graceful, brands were supposed to present a vision of life that is
sweet, wholesome and almost perfect. Everyone at that time believed that
people only want to experience positive emotions and pretend that there
was no dark side to life. Today people are conscious of the fact that
the world is far from perfect and are willing to embrace the realities
even if they are ugly, undesirable and unacceptable. The millennials and
*Gen Y*'s are less-easily shocked, outspoken and are increasingly
getting comfortable with a culture that is daring and see through.
Recently, as consumer researcher I was involved in a study whose purpose
was to get under the skin of the millennial and understand all aspects
of their lives, the good, the bad and the dark. ‘Confession booths’ were
created to encourage participants to share their dark emotions
especially those that led to buying and consuming.

Vidyut Jammwal is all praises for the Baaghi 2 actor

Like most genres, action, too, packs a punch at the box office. So, it's
not surprising that whenever there's more than one hero specialising in
that genre, talk of rivalry amongst them is imminent. After he made his
mark with Heropanti (2014) and Baaghi (2016), Tiger Shroff became the
new-age action hero. Incidentally, a year before his debut, Vidyut
Jammwal had wowed viewers with his stuntbaazi in Commando (2013).

out to be a mutual admiration society.

Pune, March 22 -- Abhishek Shah is a second year student of Symbiosis,
pursuing his Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) and has been
living in a rented flat but recently he has started looking at options.
Similarly, Rhea Ramesh and her batchmate Ritika Patni too are looking
for better places to stay for their next academic year.

"The final year of my studies is crucial and I feel I am losing focus
with all the other things that I have to do myself, like bringing
groceries, looking after my laundry. These household chores doesn't give
me enough time to concentrate on studies," said Shah who is from Surat.
His friend told him about the a student accommodation which has been set
up in Vimannagar, Pune recently. Students say that they usually stay in
college hostels or in a paying guest accommodation. Most housing
societies not wanting to encourage students as tenants is a major
problem faced by the students, they say.

Do you have a go-to retail chain for buying household basics? I do not.
I use a mental algorithm to pick a store based on expected cost,
distance from home and the amount of time I expect to have to waste in
the checkout line.

A detailed cost

that if you really want to save, you shouldn’t have a go-to store. Each
of the three has its pricing strengths and weaknesses.

More women have decided to take wealth creation into their own hands and
buy property, rather than waiting for a white knight.

That's certainly what I'm witnessing. I'm surrounded by female clients,
friends and colleagues who have purchased property because of the
perceived stability it offers.

AS MUCH as I hate to say it, and as much I may disappoint my mother,
attempting to kick Fraser Anning out of parliament because of his
disgusting comments after the terrorist attack in New Zealand might not
be in our best interest.

The report, released by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) on Tuesday (March
19), was based on a survey done last year. It covered private sector
establishments and the public sector, which comprised government

Mexico's young population and growing middle class, including an
increasing number of new business owners, will likely push the country
to become a regional innovation hub in the coming years, a report by
business consultancy Frost and Sullivan said.

The financial technology sector, which has seen growth recently after
the approval of a trailblazing fintech law in 2017, could double in size
between 2017 and 2022 to reach US$68bn in valuation, the report added,
as Mexico has also seen high rates of broadband and smartphone adoption.

There were more famous, rich and powerful names of the list of March 12
indictments in connection with what's alleged to be the nation's largest
college admissions scam ever. But none was more ironic than that of Jane
Buckingham, a pioneer in corporate trend forecasting who has spent a
career, launched while still in high school, positioning herself as a
sensible, sagacious authority in discussions about the lifestyle
anxieties of adolescents and their parents — particularly those among
America's upper classes, who can afford to seek her counsel.

Buckingham, 50, stands accused of paying $50,000 for an ACT proctor to
take the test in place of her son Jack in July 2018, as well as
considering the same action for her daughter Lilia. “I know this is
craziness, I know it is,” she confided in a staffer involved in the
purported testing scheme. “I need you to get [Jack] into USC, and then I
need you to cure cancer and [make peace] in the Middle East.”

Here’s a reader question that captures the way a lot of people think
about real estate as an investment, especially in big cities. “My
husband and I have a block of cash ($200,000) – not enough to buy real
estate here in Toronto where we live. How else can we invest with
similar returns?”

Good news – getting similar returns to real estate is easy right now.
Toronto home prices gained 1.6 per cent on average in February compared
with the same month last year. A high-interest savings accounts could
have made you 2.3 per cent over the past 12 months, with zero risk. In
Vancouver, prices fell nearly 10 per cent in February. Across the
country last month, average prices fell 5.2 per cent on a year-over-year
basis.

in Australia in the first half of this decade went to those aged 55 or
older.

The net worth of an average Australian household almost doubled from

Household Income and Wealth

While it's true that FMCG brands must consider the needs of *Gen Y*,
they also need to keep an eye on who will follow - Gen Z.

E ach generation comes with a unique set of behaviors and presents a
unique set of opportunities for those looking to reach, engage, and turn
them into loyal consumers. For the last decade or so, Millennials, or
*Gen Y*, have been the generation for brands to engage with as their
spending power grows ever higher. But now is the time for fast-moving
consumer goods (FMCG) brands to shift their focus to the following
generation - Generation Z (12 to 21 years old). Why? In Vietnam, by
2025, Gen Z will account for around 25 per cent of the country’s
workforce, which translates into 15 million potential consumers.

By now, millennials are growing accustomed to getting blamed for pretty
much everything. The end of marriage, the end of divorce, the end of sex
and the end of relationships; the demise of cinema and the rise of PC
culture. The list goes on. But it's in the culinary world that
Generation Y suffers the most virulent accusations.

Everything from the decline of
pubs[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/food-and-drink/pubs-and-bars/clean-living-millennials-really-blame-death-pub-culture/]
to the end of tuna is routinely laid at the hands of those born between
1981 and 1996. The latest grumble concerns HP Sauce. According to a poll
by luxury hotel chain Guoman Hotels, just 14 per cent of 16 to
24-year-olds (most of whom, it should be noted, are not millennials but
Generation Z), would select the condiment as their favourite Full

Early last week, a major British tabloid reported on the eldest daughter
of Michael Jackson, who had been photographed emerging from her LA home
the morning after a documentary was broadcast in which her father was
accused of molesting two young boys. “Ashamed? Paris Jackson covers her
face with her hat as she refuses to answer questions about Leaving
Neverland[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/leaving-neverland-big-unanswered-questions-michael-jackson-james/],”
ran the headline.

It was subsequently edited hours later amid anger from commenters who
insisted that, of all the people worthy of shame in the continually
bleak Jackson saga, Paris wasn’t one of them.

UK financial planners should be giving serious consideration to a £150
per month fee model to serve millennial clients with planning needs,
decent incomes, but low or no investable assets.

That is the message of US financial advice guru Michael Kitces, in an
interview with New Model Adviser®.

If it wasn't for a strict house rule that anything costing beyond the
weekly allowance had to be paid for out of extra work, Marvin Tiu Lim
might not have evolved into the accomplished entrepreneur he is today.

The youngest of five siblings, Marvin was already business-minded as a
primary school student. During summer vacations, he engaged in online
games buy-and-sell and hawked groceries and cigarettes, as well. By the
time he reached secondary school, he had graduated to trading
high-performance laptops from the US, mainly used by online gamers. He
worked with an aunt, who lived on the Mainland and secured the
equipment, which he sold to classmates and friends. Laptop Kid, the
company he set up, still exists.

To contest or not to contest. This has been the question uppermost in
the minds of NCP regarding its supremo Sharad Pawar's entering the
electoral fray.

In an about turn of sorts, the NCP leader & Maratha strongman has
indicated that he would not be contesting in the upcoming Lok Sabha
Polls. The recent change of heart comes in the aftermath of his earlier
statement barely a month ago, in which he had very much shown his
inclination for a fight. One wonders if the decision has got more to do
with the local sentiment in Madha being more in favour of Vijaysinh
Mohite-Patil than the 14 time contestant himself that could have
triggered some resentment amongst the cadre & upset the larger poll
calculus. Or could it be a fait accompli, a *Gen-Y* takeover in a quid
pro quo sort of inner party shenanigans that allowed more members of the
Martha clan to bag tickets to both the state legislature & Parliament
elections.

Let's pretend today is sunny. Better than sunny - glorious. Writing this
column a week in advance, how would I know? I can't guarantee clouds or
rain events, but let's imagine the sky as duco-blue and you say, "What a
... !" What a what? That's the question.

Beautiful day? A peach? A corker? A trimmer? Maybe this weather gives
you all the feels. Perhaps it's smokin'? Bitchin'? The cat's pyjamas? Or
the surplus of Vitamin D, minus the swelter, is a belter, a gem, a
bobby-dazzler? Because you are what you speak, when the dust settles.
Just like fashion, or agendas, or shared experiences, your vocab is a
generational yardstick - just as yardstick (the word) is a yardstick.

KUALA LUMPUR, March 14 (Bernama) – Leveraging on the digital platform to
meet customer demand, Malaysia’s young entrepreneurs who dominated 40
per cent of the country’s population are becoming more powerful in
today’s business.

This new platform seems to work well with the government’s aspiration in
making the digital economy as the new driver of development.

The problem with rules telling people how much they will need to save
for retirement is that the numbers can be large and intimidating. People
are just as likely to disengage as be motivated by these numbers,
especially if they’re having trouble finding money to save.

Yet people do want and need guidelines for retirement saving, which is
one of life’s most important personal finance tasks. Here’s a fresh take
on retirement
saving[https://www.mauldineconomics.com/the-10th-man/how-much-do-you-need-to-retire-use-the-30-rule]
that was discussed recently in a U.S. investing publication: Multiply
the value of your home by 0.3 to get the annual income you’ll need in
retirement and then divide the resulting number by 0.04 to get the
dollar amount of assets you’ll need when you retire.

Negative Effects Particularly Felt among High Net Worth Investors

COSTA MESA, Calif., March 14, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Findings from the
J.D. Power 2019 U.S. Full Service Investor Satisfaction Study(SM)
provide compelling data about investors' increasingly negative
perceptions of their investment performance, which affects their future
investment intentions and, ultimately, firms' overall performance. The
study was conducted in December 2018 when market volatility was at a
four-year high and many investors were experiencing the worst returns
since the financial crisis. Not surprisingly, investor satisfaction
suffered, but amidst that struggle, important insights about what
separates the best advisors in any market have emerged.

TORONTO, March 13, 2019 /CNW/ - New technologies are rapidly changing
the way Canadians bank as more than three-quarters of Canadians (76 per
cent) use digital channels to conduct most of their banking
transactions, up from 68 per cent two years ago. This is among the many
findings in How Canadians Bank, a recent survey of 4,000 Canadians
commissioned by the Canadian Bankers Association (CBA).

AFL-CIO. As someone who has devoted more than ten years to work on
issues related to retirement income for working Americans, I am pleased
to have this opportunity to testify on the importance of Social Security
in today's economy and to add the labor movement's voice to the
increasingly louder call for benefit expansion.

I am here today on behalf of both the IAMAW and labor's umbrella
organization, the American Federation of Labor and Congress of
Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO). The IAMAW represents some 600,000
active and retired members, in a wide variety of industries and
occupations. The IAM is also a proud member of the AFL-CIO, which
includes 54 other unions, and, together, we represent some 12.5 million
American workers.

It’s not hard to find critics of FIRE—the acronym for the financial
independence, retire early movement. The central FIRE idea embraced by
millennials violates retirement-planning orthodoxy—namely, work for 45
years or so, save 10 to 15 percent of income and retire happily ever after.

FIRE folks aim to do it a little differently. They live frugally, aiming
to save up to half of their income while young and retire in their 40s.
OK—they aim to do it very differently.

My adventures trying not to flunk math in high school may explain why a
new book caught my eye recently. It’s called Math Hacks: Cool Tips +
Less Stress = Better
Marks[https://www.amazon.ca/Math-Hacks-Stress-Better-Marks/dp/1443163163/ref=sr_1_1?crid=27M0FND6KNNY&keywords=math+hacks&qid=1551880643&s=gateway&sprefix=keepcu%2Caps%2C160&sr=8-1]
, and it’s full of bite-size practical tips for young students and their
parents on how to be better at math.

I asked the author, Vanessa Vakharia, if she might have some math hacks
to help readers of this newsletter. “Here are my five favourite math
hacks to help you essentially monetize your everyday decisions,” she
wrote back. “Yes, that’s a thing.”

BANGKOK, March 12 (TNA) - The Ministry of Commerce says that Thai
organic farm products, particularly high quality Hom Mali organice
grains, have a bright prospect in the United States.

Caretaker Commerce Minister Chutima Bunyapraphasara made the remarks on
March 11, after returning home from leading a team of her ministry's
senior executives to participate in a grand trade fair, the Natural
Product Expo West 2019, in the United States during March 4-9, aimed to
expand Thailand's international trade networks and to explore more
market opportunities for the country's exports of organic farm products.

SINGAPORE — The Government’s announcement of the revamp of the Somerset
Youth Belt, the stretch of Somerset Road that encompasses spaces such as
*Scape, The Red Box and a skate park, has received mostly positive
responses from Singaporean youth who spoke to TODAY.

They said that it was a good idea to have a youth district that supports
the aspirations of young people in the arts, culture, dance, music and
other areas such as entrepreneurship.

Hard-working, socially aware and financially savvy – the Millennials are
now older, and considerably wiser, writes Angira Bharadwaj THEY are
frequently dubbed lazy, irresponsible, and party-obsessed but new
research has painted a new image of the infamous Millennial generation.
Born between the 1980s and 1990s, these are the Aussies who grew up
around the turn of the millennium and who are famous for spending too
much, saving too little, hopping from job to job, and partner to partner.

But Australia’s biggest study on the cohort – The Australian Millennial
Report 2019 by Millennial Future – reveals it’s time to forget
everything you thought you knew about the generation.

Mumbai: Adventure holidays that guarantee a rush of adrenaline are
apparently finding many takers among women travellers. A survey carried
out by a travel company found a 32% year-on-year increase in Indian
women opting for adventure holidays, with trekking and diving topping
the list of most preferred activities. “Driving the growth were
millennials or *Gen Y*. Most women from this age group are financially
independent. About 70% of them come from metro cities while the rest
from Tier-2,” said the survey by Cox and Kings, which studied booking
and inquiry trends from a sample of 2,000 women. Other preferred
activities were walking, cycling, biking, rafting and sailing.tnn

Quibi, the ambitious new digital-content startup founded by Jeffrey
Katzenberg, has announced that one of its buzziest launch titles will be
a series about the rise of Snapchat. Katzenberg revealed the news Friday
at his session at South by Southwest.

The project is based on Frat Boy Genius, a feature film screenplay by
Elissa Karasik, whose dark, funny take on the story behind the
social-media platform landed at No. 1 on the 2018 Black List. Like a
Social Network 2.0, the script, as the title suggests, presents a deeply
unflattering portrayal of Evan Spiegel, the app's 28-year-old founder.

Back in 1982, Helen Ball had to choose between heading to university or
taking her first steps on the career ladder. She chose the latter, and
her first week at Gloucester-based Trident Life provided her with an
experience that remains valuable today.

Having joined as a trainee on the management and development programme,
Ball was offered a variety of perspectives on life in financial
services. ‘I spent two days on reception and the next two with the chief
executive,' she says. ‘I remember having to cut out coupons for people
who had responded to our newspaper adverts.'

Karan Johar's Takht is yet to go on floors. However, his two heroes are
already locking horns. Aurangzeb (Vicky Kaushal) beat Dara Shikou
(Ranveer Singh) at the ticket windows recently. Of course, Ranveer is
still the hottest young superstar on the horizon and he proved this
three times in a span of a year by scoring a hat-trick with Padmaavat,

About 55 per cent of working women say they are being held back from
landing senior jobs by the need for more flexible working arrangements.

Yet only 33 per cent of working men agreed that this was an obstacle for
women, found an Australian survey coinciding with International Women's
Day (IWD) 2019 on Friday.

A reader in his mid-70s has asked for some advice on how to get his
spouse to take more of an interest in their finances. “Being three years
older than her, I’ll probably hit the dust first,” he wrote in an
e-mail. “I worry about her complete lack of knowledge about personal
finance, banking, investments, taxes, etc.”

By coincidence, a couple of bloggers have written on this topic
recently. Mark Goodfield of The Blunt Bean Counter offers six
ways[http://www.thebluntbeancounter.com/2019/02/bridging-financial-literacy-gap-with.html]
to improve your spouse’s financial literacy that focus for the most part
on talking about money. Review the family budget together, discuss
annual investment reports and discuss daily financial events, he says.
And make sure your spouse has met your financial adviser, if you have one.

After the success of Hindi Medium (2017) and Stree (2018), filmmaker
Dinesh Vijan has begun 2019 with a bang. His production house, Maddock
Films' latest offering, Luka Chuppi, starring Kriti Sanon and Kartik
Aaryan, has crossed Rs55 crore in five days (worldwide) and is also the
biggest opener for both the *Gen-Y* actors. The film follows the journey
of Guddu and Rashmi, two small-town lovers, who wish to live in
together. Ironically, they are forced to pose as a married couple when
his kin catches them. Things go hilariously awry as his large family
ends up moving in with the duo.

It seems women find travel liberating, more so when they travel solo, in
women only groups or when they opt for adventure activities. All these
trends are on a steady rise. There was a 32 per cent year-on-year
increase in women travellers opting for adventure across soft, medium
and extreme activities, according to an international travel company
which studied booking and enquiry trends of about 2,000 women travellers
in India.

The travel liberating also found a nine per cent increase in women solo
travellers as compared to 2017 and suggests women find such experiences
“liberating” as they merge nature, adrenaline and exploration. Driving
the growth, the women largely comprises millennials or *Gen Y*,
typically born between 1980s and 1990s. About 70 per cent of them come

SINGAPORE — The next time you bite into a sizzling Impossible Patty Melt
sandwich at Park Bench Deli, you might be surprised to know that the
“beef” patty you are eating is not real beef.

Instead, it is a plant-based “beef” patty which owes its meaty flavour
to heme, an iron-containing molecule found in living organisms.

If you follow the Canada Food Guide, then you are faced with a new
personal finance challenge.

The recently updated
version[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-new-canadas-food-guide-explained/]
of the guide emphasizes eating vegetables and fruit (there’s a picture
of a plate half-covered by fruits and vegetables, with one-quarter
devoted to protein and another to whole grain foods). But fresh produce
can be expensive for a couple of reasons. One, prices can spike higher
seasonally or if harvests are affected by bad weather (remember the $7
cauliflower[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/food-and-wine/food-trends/how-did-cauliflower-come-to-cost-as-much-as-a-pound-of-grass-fed-ground-beef/article28254460/]
?). Two, some veggies and fruit have a short shelf life and may rot
before you get your money’s worth.

The *Gen-Y* star is on a high after Luka Chuppi's super success

Luka Chuppi has proved to be Kartik Aaryan's career-best opener and
biggest weekend. It earned Rs32.13 crore on its opening weekend and even
passed the Monday test by raking in Rs7.90 crore, which makes it a total
of Rs40.03 crore in the first four days. Quite naturally, Kartik has
emerged as the new blue-eyed boy of the box-office. When asked how he
felt about his romcom's BO performance, the pin-up sensation said, "I
knew that we were making a film with good content, which would surely
appeal to the youngsters and a family audience. Luka Chuppi is

Varun Dhawan has been stationed in London for a 40-day schedule of his
forthcoming film, Street Dancer. He had wrapped up Kalank before heading
to the UK capital for the dance flick. No wonder, fans have been
requesting the Judwaa actor to give a glimpse of his multi-starrer in
which he teams up with a bunch of exciting actors. Though Varun couldn't
do so, on March 4, he tweeted, "Its coming soon i promise
#wewantkalanktrailer (sic)." And he sure is keeping his word. Varun will
air-dash to Mumbai on March 11 to unveil Kalank's first look. Says a
source, "The London schedule is hectic, so Varun could squeeze in just
one day to fly into Mumbai for the Kalank event, which will be held on
March 12." The *Gen-Y* hearthrob will be seen opposite his Student Of
The Year and Dulhania franchise co-star Alia Bhatt with whom he shares
amazing chemistry in the Abhishek Varman directorial, which is produced
by Karan Johar, Sajid Nadiadwala and Fox Star Studios.

Australia's workforce is ageing, with the date at which most people
retire being extended to later and later in life. So more employers are
confronting a new challenge - employees spanning more generations than
ever before. For many that means managing expectations and experience
for workers in their teens through to 60s, 70s and beyond.

LEIGH SALES, PRESENTER: Australia's workforce is ageing, with most
people retiring later in life. That means employers are confronting a
new challenge - a workforce that spans more generations than ever

Gen Z may be the first fully "hyper-connected" digitally literate
generation but it needs careful commercial handling. Only then can
business get the best results from a largely untapped array of
whip-smart technical skills.

Also known as Gen Zee - if some of an organisation's operations are
located on the other side of the Atlantic - such an individual is
typically born between 1996 and 2010.

Pushing the limits by ascending further and diving deeper is now making
Indian women travellers feel liberated. To understand women's
participation in adventure travel, the world's oldest and the leading
travel company, Cox & Kings, studied its booking and enquiry trends of

Dating apps such as Tinder and Bumble have changed two generations of
young people so much that experts fear it’s already beginning to hit
them where it hurts - the hip pocket.

While online dating networks have revolutionised the dating process,
they’ve also thrown a major spanner in the works for many people they
were initially designed to help, instead creating a loop of disposable
relationships - some of which don’t make it through a single night.

I went to visit a friend last weekend. She's just moved into a new flat
in Kentish Town in northwest London and had invited a few of us over to
see it. We did the usual: brief tour; a bottle of wine; some dinner. And
then we were off to find the local boozer. She's 23, I'm 27, the rest of
us somewhere in between, but we all had the same thing in mind: what
better way to spend a Saturday evening than with a few pints at the pub?
( And an excellent one at that, we
discovered[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/food-and-drink/pubs-and-bars/pineapple-london-nw5-pub-review/]
).

It was cosy, relatively affordable – for London – the atmosphere
buzzing, the soundtrack terrific. At least half the clientele were
millennials (members of what is also called Generation Y, roughly aged
between 22 and 37). The pub was full, as was every other watering hole
in the vicinity – and there are countless in that particular corner of
of the capital.

Charlie Croker the protaganist of Thomas Wolfe's novel, ‘A Man in Full',
offers simple advice for those aspiring to greatness: “Never apologise
and never explain.” At the risk of disappointing my kindergarten teacher
who had such high hopes for me, I'm going to have to strike greatness
off my to-do list. I'm not going to apologise, although I will try and
explain. Back in the days before Netflix, we survived on the lean
rations of a form of entertainment known as theatre. As bizarre as it
may seem to *Gen Y*, a few deluded souls researched, discussed and

Gaming has come a long way since the time youngsters held the plastic
controls wired to the TV sets and made the Mario and Prince of Persia
move, jump and run along the screens. The side-scrolling games made way
for technology that is reinvented every day. Today, you have high-end
graphic games like ‘Red Dead Redemption 2’ and ‘Spiderman’ that keep
youngsters hooked to their screens. Strategy, presence of mind, finger
strength (pun intended) are the key to gaming of the day. While gaming
competitions are held in high regard, the drawing rooms (or anywhere the
mobile phone goes for that matter) are the war zones for the chronic
gamers.It has become a common sight to see youngsters glued to their
PS4, Xbox and phones playing the latest. Games have now evolved beyond
the 8-bit arcade versions that used to be played in malls. There are
also competitions held for the most popular of the games that see avid
participation from youngsters.

banking users in Asean and the third-highest value of e-commerce in the
region, said Yuttachai Teyarachakul, managing director of United

subscriptions. Find any you’re not actually using and cancel them.

After reading this
article[http://money.com/money/5633415/quitting-subscription-services-psychology/?utm_campaign=money_moneymagazine&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_medium=social]
, I know that most people won’t cancel their unwanted subscriptions.
It’s not laziness – the problem is that the companies offering these
services make it difficult to unsubscribe. For example, they may tap
into your FOMO – fear of missing out – anxieties by showing what you’ll
be missing if you leave.
