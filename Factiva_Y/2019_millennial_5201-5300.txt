New Year, new you January's here! Everyone is insisting on dry January
to make this bleak month even bleaker. I'm taking a new approach — after
an incredibly busy 2018 launching Soda in the US, my resolution is to
work less hard, sleep more and generally take part in more organised
fun. Here are my top tips for tech-inspired new year resolutions.

?Grace is the founder and CEO of Soda, soda.shop, @gracergould Oura Ring
Prince Harry is a fan of this fitnesstracking smart ring. Oura tracks
your sleep and activity levels using infrared radiation, a NTC body
temperature sensor and a tiny accelerometer. It comes in matt black,
silver or a limited-edition Diamond version.

There are big uncertainties on the horizon in 2019 but you can plan for
changes that will leave some people better off while others may have an
even harder time making ends meet

A raft of changes affecting everything from income tax to pensions and
duty on wine will determine whether you are richer or poorer by the end
of 2019.

For its 2019 recruitment campaign, "Your Army Needs You," the army is

There's little doubt Wall Street is bullish on 5G wireless services as a
catalyst for tech stocks linked to markets such as the Internet of
Things, autonomous vehicles and augmented reality. 5G wireless networks
will boost data speeds by 100 times over current speeds, while
connecting to tens of billions more devices.

That's impressive stuff. The challenge for investors is in finding early
bird specials on companies likely to receive a near-term lift as the 5G
technology goes mainstream. The lift for some 5G business models, such
as those involving self-driving cars, to produce sizable revenue, could
be a decade away, some pundits say.

(PRWeb) - They see you when youre sleeping. They know when youre awake.
And, more than likely, they know where you live. Big Data, that is. So,
its no wonder that the growing expectation among travelers is for a
seamless and personalized travel experience in 2019. And thanks to Big
Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, and savvy online
marketing campaigns, consumers may get their wish, according to industry
experts who went One-on-One with ExpertFlyer just before the holidays.

Just selling a seat on a plane or putting a head in a bed is not enough
today, explains Gilad Berenstein, Founder and CEO of Utrip, which uses
AI technology and personal data to create a custom travel experience.
People plan all the time, across all devices. Thus, trip planning needs
to be more omnipresent and tools such as AI and personalization help
keep travelers engaged throughout their entire planning process.

If Republicans have a lick of sense, they are alarmed by a recent sign
of intelligent life in the other party. The sign is the election by
Democrats in the House of Representatives of Illinois Rep. Cheri Bustos
as chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. In November
she won a fourth term by 24 percentage points, the largest margin of any
Democrat running in a district Donald Trump carried in 2016. Her task as
chair, which is to cement the Democrats’ House majority in 2020,
involves this arithmetic:

The wedding industry is alive and well despite some news to the contrary.

"The way we see it, there's enough business to go around for everyone,"
said Toronto-based wedding planner Tracey Manailescu.

Last year was a lackluster year for legacy makeup brands in the mass
market. Despite turnaround efforts aimed at attracting younger
generations of consumers, brands such as Cover Girl, Revlon and Almay
all saw year-over-year sales declines and even E.l.f. sales dropped
sharply. L’Oréal’s stable of brands, including Maybelline, L’Oréal Paris
and NYX Professional Makeup, along with Markwins-owned Wet ‘n’ Wild, are
the exceptions when it comes to the big brands — each saw sales increase
last year. In 2019, mass-makeup brands are continuing to churn out new
products inspired by prestige trends and designed with Millennials and
Generation Z in mind, but in a market where consumers are faced with
increasing options in online and specialty, the jury is out on whether
they’ll bite.

When did gin become such a thing? Asked by a barman if I prefer
Tanqueray or Gordon's, I reply whichever is cheapest and, for my
unsophisticated palate, get a look of disdain. But tonic has a bitter
kick and once lemon is added, who honestly can tell. (My G&T tip, via my
restaurateur sister-in-law, is to use giant cubes which don't melt so
fast and dilute your drink.) Now the emperor's new tipple is "craft
gin": agricultural ethanol flogged at inflated prices by the addition of
"botanicals", a pretentious word for plants.

I'm reminded of the luxury vodka boom in the 2000s, when drinkers were
told some generic alcohol was actually made with glacial meltwater or
thrice-filtered through a Finnish virgin's thong. All because vodka has
no vintage years and doesn't improve with age, so the only way to
justify premium prices for moonshine is marketing. Ditto gin.

Konjac, water kefir, shio koji... foodies will have lots of new things
on their plates in 2019, says

Your chocolate fix With the sugar tax hitting chocolate bars, expect
many companies to follow the example of Cadbury, which is to launch a
Dairy Milk with 30 per cent less sugar this year. A more appealing
development will be the arrival in the UK this month of Tony's
Chocolonely (available in Selfridges, then Ocado). With its funky Willy
Wonka wrapper and bold promise to create slavery-free confectionery (the
cocoa trade is bedevilled by child labour), it's already the ethical
choice for Dutch consumers. And the milk chocolate almond honey nougat
bar is delicious.

The army has a new generation in its sights for its latest recruitment
campaign. Instead of hardened gym goers it is targeting gaming addicts
and "phone zombies" in the hopes of boosting the number of millennials
signing up.

A series of TV and radio adverts, alongside a billboard campaign, spin
negative stereotypes of young people, showing how they can be useful to
the service.

New Delhi, Jan. 3 -- We often wondered if the *millennial* women want
affirmative action at the workplace to ensure equality between men and
women, or use meritocracy as a reason to reject it. Affirmative action
in this case can be described as a policy or programme designed to
counter discrimination against women in areas such as employment and
education.

In previous decades, this has been one of the most popular strategies
for moving towards gender equality and creating opportunities for women.
Interestingly, an overwhelming 93% of our survey respondents-a sample of
urban, educated *millennial* women-said they believed in the power of
affirmative action, even today, drowning out the small voice of those
who believe it goes against gender equality.

New Delhi, Jan. 3 -- After MasterChef Australia judge George Calombaris
declared Saransh Goila's version of butter chicken as the best in the
world on the hit reality cooking show MasterChef Australia in 2018, it
catapulted Goila onto the global stage. "Ever since the show, there has
been a huge spike in orders in Mumbai, while we have people coming from
different parts of the world to try Goila Butter Chicken," says the
31-year-old, who runs three outlets in Mumbai and is working on
expanding the brand to Bengaluru, Delhi and Gurugram in 2019.

After Manyavar, Tata Capital asks ladkewale to share the expenses.

These days, ads relating to products/ services from the BFSI sector are
not without a deep rooted social message and often, they veer away from
overly tongue-in-cheek humour to get the message across to intended
audiences. However, that's not how Tata Capital, the financial services
arm of the $100 bn Tata Group, sees things. They recently rolled out a
social media campaign titled #WedEqual, starring stand-up comedian
Mallika Dua, that addresses the rather heavy task of figuring out
wedding expenses, and in particular, who's footing the bill.

Mobile money accounts — a stripped-down banking and deposit transfer
service offered by mobile carriers through banks — have done well
overseas, but have mostly failed to take off in the United States.

T-Mobile is looking to change that by launching a checking account

Why Juhi Godambe won't bank on the connections of her famous parents,
makeup artists Bharat and Dorris.

By the time she completed her post-graduate course in Buying and
Merchandising at London School of Fashion, Juhi Godambe was sure that
she wanted to start her own clothing brand. That was three years ago.
Within a year's time, she had founded Arabellaa, a label for young,
fashion-forward women, and set up her fashion blog, too. Within a month
of starting her eponymous website, Godambe, then 22, landed her first
big gig as a blogger. She was invited to blog about the Lakmé Fashion
Week. "One of the sponsors wanted someone to cover streetstyle fashion.
That was my first paid collaboration," says Godambe, who hasn't looked
back since.

For all the stereotypes Tollywood broke in 2018, it also carelessly
revelled in the comfort of good ol’ formula. For every film that dealt
with a subject maturely, there were others that refused to budge and sat
deep rooted in misogyny. Even worse, high expectations were pinned on
stories that failed to take off or were plagiarised with characters that
left the audience baffled. Here are the Top 10 Telugu movies that were
total cringe-fests this year: 1.AgnyaathavaasiA billionaire heir returns
home from exile to find out who murdered his father upon his
stepmother’s request.Surrounded by controversy right from the word go,
Trivikram’s Pawan Kalyan starrer was so all over the place, even a
die-hard PK fan couldn’t come to its defence. Not to mention the fact
that director Jerome Salle accused Trivikram of freemaking
Agnyaathavaasi by lifting the story from his French film Largo Winch.

By Paul DupuisCall it unprecedented or disruptive, the change that
pervades business today can alter the game — in form, velocity and
unpredictability. This transformation has brought about unimaginable
demands in technology, organisation structures, business models and
people demographics.The volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous
(VUCA) universe of business heralds a chaotic 'new normal’ that will
change the face of human resources (HR) in coming years. It can no
longer afford to be on the periphery if it wants to be a force of
consequence. Getting a seat at the business table becomes redundant — it
has to consider itself the business. Its tedious identity that
vacillates between being a people and business function has to go.
Unless HR sees itself as a prime mover of organisational capability, it
will fast become obsolete. Tomorrow’s HR will not see its effectiveness
in theories or textbook manuals. It is best drawn from today’s realities
and business experiences.

Valeska was involved in the largest Indonesian livestock export program
conference earlier this year, attended by more than 750 farmers,
industry associations, importers, exporters and government representatives.

"It hit me then that the event epitomises the 30-plus year journey
between Indonesia and Australia - particularly in the agricultural, beef
and cattle space - and I am privileged to be a part of it," she said.

ALMOST a year after Louis CK’s #metoo mea culpa, he has launched
something of a comeback tour.

Following a year of near silence from the comedian, audio was leaked on
December 30 of a fresh comedy set, performed at a club in Levittown, New
York. Boy, did it get a few knickers in a twist.

WHEN are politicians going to wake up and realise pill testing doesn’t
encourage drug use?

Young people aren’t stupid. We know there is no “safe drug”. We know if
we were to acquire some sort of pill before a music festival, or any
other event, the dangers associated with taking it are high. I mean the
internet has so much, probably too much, information readily available
about illicit substances that you’re kidding yourself if you think
Millennials haven’t already familiarised themselves with the basic data,
at the very least.

Toronto's millennials are buying more space than they were a year ago
but they are moving farther from the downtown to get it, according to a
new report by Royal LePage .

That's in part due to Canada's new mortgage stress test, which is adding
significantly to the challenge of home ownership among the influential
consumer group known as peak millennials, reducing their average
purchasing power by 16.5 per cent or about $40,000.

Mergers among asset managers are set to continue at "heightened" levels
in 2019, according to consultants, as the industry battles headwinds on
a number of fronts.

Alongside pressure on profit margins from falling fund fees and
increased regulatory costs, UK companies also find themselves easier
targets for foreign buyers thanks to a Brexit-weakened pound, according
to a January 2 note from Alpha FMC, the asset management consultancy.

Forget fevered bidding wars and snap home-buying decisions. Slower and
steadier will characterize next year's housing market.

That follows a 2018 that started off hot but softened into the fall as
buyers – put off by high prices and few choices – sat out rather than
paid up.

Politicians of all stripes delivered holiday messages, which have

few of them:

SO you've met somebody and you're really into them. But they take
forever to answer your texts, and when they do their replies are short
or cold in tone. Sorry to break it to you, but you could be the victim
of a nasty dating trend called curving.

Like ghosting, curving is the new *millennial* dating trend - it's a way
of letting someone down without actually telling them you're no longer
interested.

It’s that time of the year when someone dares to analyze the brand
winners and losers of 2018. And this year, our team at Vivaldi had
plenty to select from.

It is impossible to give credit to all the best and worst performers.
There are simply too many brands that apply. However, we are certain
that the top winners and losers we chose hold valuable lessons for
anyone looking to build a strong brand in the coming years.

Ten years ago, on Jan. 3, 2009, the Bitcoin
(BTC[https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin]) network was created. Since
then, the asset’s price has famously been subject to volatility. That,
along with the inceptive crypto’s focus on decentralization, have been
disturbing mainstream media, which still fails to grasp and discuss the
concept of Bitcoin without
skepticism[https://cointelegraph.com/news/bubble-goat-chicken-mcnuggets-bitcoin-as-seen-on-tv]
— hence the omnipresent headlines exclaiming its so-called
death.[https://cointelegraph.com/news/tulips-bubbles-obituaries-peering-through-the-fud-about-crypto]

In purely physical terms, the new year is just the beginning of another
cycle of the planet in its orbit around our sun, bringing the four
seasons in temperate regions and ushering in the dry season here in the
Caribbean.

In terms of human psychology however, each new year marks a fresh start.
It allows us to turn the page, make new promises and plans, and put any
disappointments and difficulties of the previous year behind us, while
celebrating the joys it may have brought.

The title of first citizen of the third millennium was claimed yesterday

midnight chimes of Big Ben were heard across the Thames in London.

Almost a year after Louis CK’s #metoo mea culpa, he has launched
something of a comeback tour. Following a year of near-silence from the
American-Mexican comedian, audio was leaked on December 30 of a fresh
comedy set, performed at a club in Levittown, New York. And boy, did it
get a few knickers in a
twist[https://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/louis-ck-mocks-parkland-survivors-at-new-york-gig/news-story/dfdddef99da46054807f4671a041b6a2].

CK threw a few potshots at hypersensitive Millennials; a popular subject
for any comedian. Speaking as a *Millennial*; who wouldn’t make fun of
us? We’re ridiculous. In order to point this out, CK compared his own
experience as a young person (which apparently involved much debauchery
and narcotics) with today’s youth:

While 89 percent of *millennial* renters say they plan to buy a home
someday, just 4 percent expect to buy in 2019 and 30 percent say they
will wait at least five years, according to a new survey by Apartment
List, a rental property database.

For most of the millennials in the survey, affordability is the biggest
obstacle for their purchase, cited by 72 percent. While cash needs are
the paramount obstacle, 38 percent of millennials say they have bad
credit and 29 percent say the monthly payments for a home are an obstacle.

In an interview with BestMediaInfo.com, the India CEO of TBWA talks
about the challenging times ad agencies are facing and how TBWA is
making itself future-ready to be Indiaas top digitally native ad agency
on the back of a disruptive model. Pandey also reveals the agencys
growth strategy for 2019

Only learning faster than the change can save the current day ad
agencies from becoming dinosaurs in the future, believes Govind Pandey,
Chief Executive Officer, TBWA Group India. "The industry is going
through a big shift. And as an industry, our reaction to this change has
been incremental and short term. We need to experiment and explore and
learn faster than the change. Unfortunately, we are not doing that
enough in marketing and advertising," Pandey told BestMediaInfo.com in
an interview.

More vegetables. Improved gut bacteria. Cocktails with less alcohol.

Many of the predictions about what we'll eat and drink in 2019 point to
a quiet, restorative and potentially grim time ahead. Then again, these
forecasts always arrive carrying the clean, healthy pine scent of New
Year's resolutions.

A provincial party that offers hope for overcoming the high cost of
housing will have an edge with a generation of highly educated
millennials looking for a way out of their parents' basements and into
the housing market, says the Ontario Real Estate Association (OREA).

At a time when nearly half the people aged 25 to 34 are living with
their parents, 91 per cent of millennials still believe that owning a
home is a smart financial investment. But nearly 70 per cent of those in
that age bracket said they agree or somewhat agree that buying a home in
their neighbourhood is unaffordable, according to OREA research
published Monday.

F45 is a brutal new fitness movement loved by millennials. But married
mother-of-four GERALDINE BEDELL insists... THE YEAR I... 2018

AT THE end of this summer, I was distinctly flabby. I'd got out of the
habit of exercising. I'd broken my arm on holiday, and then my gym
burned down. I know that sounds like 'the dog ate my homework', but it's
true. Then I came across the F45 Challenge, a fantastically successful —
if punishing — eight-week programme of exercise and dieting from the
world's fastest-growing fitness empire. F45 promised that if I joined
one of its gyms, and followed its diet plan, it would transform my body
— making a new, lean me in just eight weeks.

Train fares have risen almost three times faster than wages since the
start of the decade despite anger about delays, overcrowding and strikes.

Analysis shows that regulated fares have jumped 36 per cent since 2010,
which is 2.6 times the rise in earnings. From today the price of some
annual tickets goes up by more than £200.

STATE OF TRAVEL Kate Kenward, executive director of the Association of
Independent Tour Operators Brexit doesn't seem to have dampened
consumers' desire and confidence. Only 9 per cent of people say they
would be taking fewer holidays over the next three years, according to
Aito's 2018 Travel Insights survey of more than 22,000 people, whereas
22 per cent said they would be taking more.

Walking into someone's house and seeing "Live, Laugh, Love" on their

years, I have had the same reaction to those who insist on writing "New
Year, New Me" captions on their social media posts on the first day of a
new year.
