What would Marjorie Dawes from Fat Fighters say? Calorie-counters and
comedy fans alike have warmly greeted news that comedian Matt Lucas is
joining Noel
Fielding[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2020/03/11/comedian-matt-lucas-join-bake-presenter/]
as co-presenter of The Great British Bake
Off[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2020/03/10/great-celebrity-bake-stand-cancer-episode-1-recap-will-coronavirus/].
Channel 4 execs must have looked at the line-up of potential candidates,
pointed at the Little Britain star and said: “Want that one!”

It’s a surprise announcement that no pundit saw coming but could turn
out to be an inspired piece of casting. Expect Bake Off to become even
funnier, if a little more shambolic. Either way, it should make for
must-see viewing when the baking contest returns this summer.

home improvements. Founded by software industry veterans, Curbio
combines the systems and processes of a technology company with the
expertise of a national design-build firm to create a hassle free

TORONTO, Ontario, March 11, 2020 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Fivewalls recent
research shows that millennials, especially those in the Greater Toronto
Area, face many stresses as they enter the housing market. Three storm
fronts are brewing to make a Perfect Storm and they are feeling it.
Storm front one - the relative mortgage debt load is 400% greater than
it was for their parents. Storm front two - there is the challenge and
confusion around the qualifying mortgage stress test rules which limit
borrowing capacity. Storm front three - with only a few exceptions, the
Canadian housing market is mostly a seller's market.

RICHMOND, Va., March 11, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Devils Backbone Brewing
Company partnered with Familiar Creatures for the second year in a row
to launch their new paid social media campaign. To speak directly to the
brewer's *millennial* dad target, the ad agency created videos with a
nostalgic jingle sung over romanticized, tongue-in-cheek visuals. The
retro approach is intended to stand out in the social media space, where
brands often strive to be trendy, hip and relevant.

Working with the music composition company Overcoast, Familiar Creatures
wrote a feel-good jingle that encourages drinkers to slow down and savor
a moment with their beer. Overcoast then commissioned a musician who's
sung jingles for Folgers, Gillette and Big Red Gum, popular staples of
80's advertising.

Commercial landlords swept up in coworking and open office trends have
not lost sight on the importance of physical office space in
accommodating the *millennial* consumer. Architects, landlords, and
tenants alike note that millennials, as well as their younger cohort
Gen-Z, are more transient than previous generations and because of that
need flexible work accommodations. However, both groups also desire an
office setting to plug-in for longterm career confidence, according to a
recent Deloitte survey on workplace flexibility.

There are both historic and coronavirus-related reasons to visit Bury St
Edmunds this year

It is, as of 2020, 1,000 years since the Abbey of St Edmund was founded
by King Canute. To last a millennium is a stupendously rare achievement,
which is why we shouldn’t be too hard on the abbey for barely lasting
half that long. Alas, it was sundered by the Dissolution of the
Monasteries, and now exists as little more than a pile of flinty rubble.

Everyone should have the perfect navy sweater, blazer and tux trousers,
the presenter/designer tells Harriet Walker

She’s a regular clothes horse for Chloé, Chanel and the like, but right
now all Alexa Chung wants to wear is the perfect navy blue jumper. “I’ve
been begging for one ever since we launched my brand,” she says.
“Finally, we’ve done this cashmere-blend crewneck with the perfect,
slightly oversized fit. Before now I’ve ended up looking for them in the
men’s department.”

For Millennials

BENTONVILLE, Ark., March 11, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Today Heartland
Forward released new research, "Millennials Find New Hope In The
Heartland," analyzing demographic trends in the center of the country.
The research, led by Senior Fellow Joel Kotkin, finds the Heartland is
attracting and retaining millennials at higher rates than in the past,
and three of the nation's ten best-performing metro areas for
millennials are now in the Heartland. Lower costs of living, increased
high-tech job growth, and a greater sense of community are among the
main factors driving these trends.

Where have the last 30 years of my life gone? I blinked and the time

Ontario's *millennial* and first-time home buyers are mostly looking for
detached and semi-detached primary homes - and not condos, according to
new research conducted by Ipsos for the Ontario Real Estate
Association's first annual Buyers and Sellers ResearchReport.

Among the 19 per cent of all Ontarians looking to buy a home within the
next year, the vast majority (84 per cent) are looking for detached,
semi-detached, or townhomes. This is particularly true with millennials
(83 per cent) and first-time home buyers (83 percent). In fact, 51 per
cent of first-time buyers say they are looking for a detached home,
while 22 per cent say they are looking for atownhouse.

The gender-job shift is one of the most important social issues of our
time. It goes to the heart of our determination to provide equal access
to jobs. The argument being that over time women have been largely
excluded from male-dominated jobs and that imbalance is being corrected
in a process called the great gender-job shift.

This is an important issue for the property industry because, if a
gender-job shift is under way, then women will have a rising capacity to
independently buy residential property. This could create a market
nuanced to female needs — for example, greater security features.

FOCUS on what’s important and let the rest of the noise fade out. That’s
a mantra Toowoomba photographer, and former Northwest Queensland station
manager, Jo Thieme lives by.

It’s also a disposition you could use to sum up her fine-art imagery.
Her pictures zero in on the heart of the action: jockeys primed as they
jump from the gates at a bush racing carnival, or the sheer power of a
stock horse making a big sliding stop, with dust flying, at the
Cloncurry Stockman’s Challenge, The noise – like rusty panels from an
old arena, spectators watching on or lopsided hessian – is removed from
the frame.

*HD* 	Dispatch From Mississippi: Biden, Sanders, and the Battle to Win
Black Voters in the South

On a bright and blustery Saturday afternoon, three days before the
Mississippi primary, the 36-year-old mayor of Jackson, Chokwe Antar
Lumumba, approached a group of men drinking beers around a pickup truck
outside the Head Turners Barbershop. Bearing the seal of his office on a
black windbreaker, Lumumba solemnly informed the men they were in
violation of city ordinances, triggering peals of laughter all around.
Then Lumumba got down to business. He was there to generate interest in
Bernie Sanders, and skepticism about Joe Biden, the presumed favored
candidate of Mississippi Democrats.

Lumumba had arrived at the barbershop from a nearby Baptist Church,
where he’d launched a Sanders volunteer canvass of the historic black
community of Presidential Hill. While volunteers knocked on screen doors
and left flyers on porches, he and another surrogate, the Miami-based
organizer and educator Philip Agnew, hit the barbershops of north Jackson.

The chairman of logistics giant Toll Group has revealed the crippling
cyber attack that hit it at the end of January came from Russian-based
hackers, describing it as a terrible lesson for the company, and a
warning for other organisations that they were not safe.

Toll chairman John Mullen, who is also the chairman of Telstra, went
further than the company's managing director Thomas Knudsen, who this
week told The Australian Financial Review that he did not know where its
attackers were based, and gave dramatic insight into the tough decision
about whether to pay the hackers' ransom.

Interactive-video company Eko struck back against Jeffrey Katzenberg’s
Quibi with its own lawsuit, accusing Quibi of infringing one of Eko’s
patents and misappropriating its trade secrets.

The Eko suit, filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the Central
District of California Western Division, comes a day after Quibi
proactively filed a federal lawsuit seeking a judgment that its
Turnstyle mobile-video technology does not infringe Eko’s patent and
that Quibi did not steal trade secrets.

With the Leap Day release of his second full-length solo albumYHLQMDLG,
Bad Bunny has achieved feats rarer than a day that comes around once
every four years.

Though the set only debuts at No. 2 on this week';s Billboard albums
chart — bested by Lil Baby';sMy Turn, which moves 197,000 equivalent
album units — it does so with an impressive 179,000 units moved itself.
That number (accomplished in a shorter sales week than Lil Baby and
others, due to its Saturday release) represents the biggest week for a
Latin album release sinceBillboard began tracking titles by equivalent
album units in 2014, and also results inYHLQMDLG becoming the
highest-charting all-Spanish-language title in the chart';s nearly
64-year history.

Whether or not Bernie Sanders secures the Democratic nomination, his
candidacy has created a political challenge of no small consequence to
the Democratic Party. The fact that Sanders is a democratic socialist
has opened up a line of attack for Donald Trump: red-baiting. And Trump
has made clear that he will not attack only Sanders and other democratic
socialists such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The president and his
allies will attack all Democrats, which means that all Democrats will
find themselves wrestling with the question of how to address the S-word
in 2020. Fortunately, that’s not nearly as daunting a prospect as some
political seers would have us believe.

Phoebe Maltz Bovy is a Toronto-based writer and author of The Perils of
“Privilege”: Why Injustice Can’t Be Solved by Accusing Others of Advantage.

This year, the magazine Slate published an advice column that began as
follows: “I’m a cis woman in kind of a classic *millennial* sex pickle:
I’m really repelled by heterosexuality politically and personally." And
yet, she explained in graphic terms, men turn her on. The letter-writer
wondered if it would be okay for her to avail herself of hookup apps for
gay men, thereby leaving heteroland behind while still getting to date
dudes.

George Shultz turns 100 this year – and like anyone reaching that age,
he has lived through great historical moments. These range from the
Great Depression, to the rise of fascism in Europe and World War II, to
the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Soviet Union.

But much more than most, Mr. Shultz – one of only two people in U.S.
history to have served in four Cabinet positions – has not just
witnessed these moments. He had a hand in influencing some of the
defining features of the 20th century, including the postwar reign of
the dollar, the rebottling of the menacing nuclear genie, and the
management and ultimate demise of the Cold War.

Trip-cancellation insurance is one of those financial products that
makes some sense but seems totally skippable. And then came coronavirus,
which is causing people to cancel trips to affected areas like Italy.

Trip cancellation is a lot like travel emergency medical insurance. It
sounds great in theory, but making claims is tricky because of
exclusions and rules in the fine print. For some help on deciphering
trip-cancellation
insurance[https://www.moneywehave.com/how-trip-cancellation-insurance-works/]
, check out a recent post by budget travel blogger Barry Choi.

Home-cooked lunches and no commuting while we deal with coronavirus
can’t compensate for what’s lost in creativity.

I’m writing this from the makeshift quarantine bunker in my dining room
— sweatpants on, hand sanitizer nearby, snacking my way through my
emergency rations. I’m getting plenty of work done, but I’m starting to
get unnerved by the lack of stimulation. It’s been hours (days?) since I
interacted face to face with a human who is not related to me, and cabin
fever is setting in.

It’s tricky to pack our small spaces with supplies, but the real
struggle is deciding how worried to be.

Because my apartment is too small to store the recommended pandemic
preparedness supplies without turning the space into an obstacle course,
the packages of water, peanut butter, canned soup, granola bars, frozen
vegetables, pasta, tomato sauce, Theraflu, DayQuil, and Purell now
protrude from under my girlfriend’s dining room table (which is also the
kitchen table and living room table) in her slightly bigger place, where
I spend half of my weeknights anyway.

FASHION It's a frilling year for our wardrobes as the prairie dress
emerges as a style staple. The future is feminine, says Emma McCarthy

THERE'S nothing pretty about the state of affairs right now. Except for
perhaps the new in section of Zara. There you will find pie-crust
collars and puff sleeves, pintuck frills and petal pink wallpaper
florals. These may be tumultuous, politically-charged,
pandemic-impending times, but as far as our wardrobes are concerned,
things couldn't be lovelier.

Workers won’t have to choose between paying off their student loans and
saving for retirement with a new benefit from CommonBond, a student loan
repayment benefit provider.

The company launched a new product earlier this year that allows
employees who aren’t saving for retirement to receive an employer
contribution to their retirement fund — as long as they’re paying off
student debt. The program, called Retirement Contribution, tracks and
verifies employee student loan payments so they can qualify for employer
contributions.

Taxe season can be a windfall or a wipeout for your budget. Which camp
you fall into likely depends on whether you get a refund — or a tax bill
— from the IRS.

If you find that you owe taxes, you’re not alone. Over 23 million
Americans owed the IRS a balance in 2019, a nearly 6% increase from the
year before, according to a 2019 report from the Taxpayer Advocate
Service, a government organization that represents taxpayers.

"I've never seen such dramatic damage. Not here or anywhere else," says
Rapa Nui museum director Paula Valenzuela. A curator specializing in
stone, she prepared for the National Cultural Heritage Service the
preliminary report of the effects she left on the *millennial* ahu
(ceremonial platform) and Moái O Hae the impact of a Chevrolet Luv
pickup that rolled hillside on March 1 down in the Pua A Pau sector, on
the north coast of Easter Island.The worst part was the sculpture of
2.18 m high carved in a single piece of tuba (type of rock) of the
volcano Rano Raraku and that for at least five centuries rested,
semi-buried and sided, next to the ceremonial platform on which it was
once installed.

I SPENT all weekend binge-watching a reality TV show called Love is
Blind on Netflix. The show has been sneered at by critics – it’s trash,
they say, it’s manipulative, it’s gaudy, empty, it’s exploitative, it’s
voyeuristic, it panders to narcissism. It’s cruel and meretricious.

Yes, it’s all of those things – it’s hard to find any reality TV show
which doesn’t immediately seem merely glittering and hollow.

Cancun, QR. The economic impact of the Maya Train and the Interoceanic
Corridor of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, the main regional projects of
the federal government, would be equivalent or even greater than that of
the Panama Canal, due to the mobilization of goods that is envisaged for
these works.

This is anticipated by the study called Mayan Territories in the Train
Pass: Current Situation and Foreseeable Risks, prepared by the National
Council of Science and Technology (Conacyt), in collaboration with
academics and researchers from entities such as the College of Southern
Border, the National Institute of Anthropology and History and the
National Autonomous University of Mexico, among others.

BAY CITY, Mich. -- When the United Auto Workers went on strike against
General Motors last fall, Robby Lamas and those left at the massive
engine plant in this Michigan city walked the picket lines day and
night. Mr. Lamas, who, at 30, was the youngest at the plant by a decade,
was unsure how the public would react to the walkout, his first strike.

After all, employment at the plant is now a fraction of what it once
was. And not far from anyone's mind was the fact that Bay County flipped
to Republican in 2016, against the wishes of the U.A.W. The county was
one of 12 former Democratic strongholds in Michigan that delivered parts
of the once impregnable industrial Midwest to Donald J. Trump.

Mumbai (Maharashtra), March 10 -- : With the 21st century *millennial*
women becoming progressive and increasingly financially independent,
there is a distinct shift in their investment preferences -- from gold
and fixed deposits to real estate.

In the latest Anarock-LIC Housing Finance Ltd consumer sentiment survey,
nearly 57 per cent women respondents preferred real estate as an
investment asset class followed by 28 per cent for the stock market, 11
per cent for fixed deposits and a mere 4 per cent for gold.

Young people take a more sensible approach to job hunting, and
everything else

"Times are bad. Children no longer obey their parents, and everyone is
writing a book". Cicero, to whom that line is attributed, was not the
last to look at a younger generation and see a bunch of feckless
narcissists. It is no different for Generation Z, those born between the
mid 1990s and early 2010s. Their image is one of perpetually offended
"snowflakes" who refuse to confront facts they find uncomfortable. Yet
research shows that there is a steely eyed pragmatism to Gen Z,
particularly when compared to the generation before them, the millennials.

All companies are competing to make the consumers buy their goods or
service, aiming to increase their sales and make high profits. Besides
the quality and the value each brand provides to customers, producers
found that customers nowadays are buying brands instead of products.

The 2020 Valentine’s Day celebration otherwise known as lovers’ day saw
a lot of banters among the *millennial*, as some brands with this class
of audience as target, seized the opportunity to enter into online
real-time conversation with its audience.

Millennials are putting their lives at risk on our roads in alarming
numbers. New research from Driver Safety Australia has found young
drivers know very little about maintaining the cars they drive.

Many don’t know the basics of checking oil and coolant, replacing
windscreen wipers or checking tyre pressure.
