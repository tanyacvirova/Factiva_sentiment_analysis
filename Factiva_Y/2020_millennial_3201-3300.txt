A big boost in sales over the crucial Christmas period has reassured
investors that Asos is getting back on track after a tumultuous year
that included two profit warnings.

The online fashion retailer reported a 20 per cent increase in sales to
£1.1 billion for the four months to December 31, comfortably beating
City predictions. The shares leapt by 276p, or 9.1 per cent, to £33 but
remain at half the value of their peak in 2018.

The traditions of bingo are being called into question by a new
generation of players who would rather the "two fat ladies" used for the
number 88 were replaced with more up-to-date terminology such as "Wills
and Kate". Foxy Bingo, an online gambling company, polled its customers
to find their preferred terms for a "*millennial* bingo" variant of the
game, which it is considering building for release later this year. The
idea came from the website's chat rooms, where players would often use
alternatives to traditional calls such as "knock at the door" for four
and "two little ducks" for 22.

It is not clear whether "two fat ladies" has lost favour because players
wish to avoid body-shaming language, but a spokeswoman for the company
said that its main customer base was *millennial* women aged 25 to 35.

MOVIES 1917 Opens As 1917 opens, a British lance corporal named
Schofield (George MacKay) and his friend Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman)
are assigned the daunting task of delivering a life-or-death message to
1,600 British troops preparing to attack German enemy lines. What ensues
is a classic race against the clock -made more urgent by the fact that
the survival of Blake's own brother is at stake -as the soldiers
encounter perils as well as moments of improbable poetry, altruism and
blunt human cruelty. But while 1917 is impressive, it is oddly
distancing and gimmicky.

*** BAD BOYS FOR LIFE Bad Boys for Life is in the third instalment of
the franchise that began in 1995. The titular detective duo returns,
family man Marcus (Martin Lawrence) and his playboy partner Mike (Will
Smith) are older, but the filn is cacophonous, at times preposterous,
hyperviolent, coarse and silly. Third time's a charm.

future supplies with these developing trends, said a statement from the
company.

Jayshree Periwal, who introduced the session on Mythology for
*Millennial* with Meenakshi Reddy Madhavan and Anand Neelakantan, kicked
off the discussion with the remark mythology is not science, but a way
of life.

The session was essentially about ways of writing mythology in modern
times and the relevance of these tales.

With premium shoe brands like Clarks Future Footwear (JV between Future
Group and UK-based premium footwear brand Clarks), Woodland, Puma seeing
growth, the saying 'One can never have too many shoes' is proven right.
Despite slowdown the premium shoes have remained unaffected, and is
growing at an average of 30% y-o-y.

Estimated at $8.49 billion in 2020 (as per data from research firm
Statista), the footwear market is growing annually by 12.6%. Industry

the total market size.

Maharashtra has made learning Marathi compulsory till Class 12. Kerala
made learning of Malayalam compulsory some years ago. Against the tide
of language fanaticism and compulsory mother tongue learning, Andhra
Pradesh saw merit in making English compulsory. Karnataka under
Siddaramaiah saw the rise of Kannada crusaders who harboured ideas of
mandating that even adults spoke the language at workplaces. I hold no
brief for any language and am proud that I can read, speak and write
three languages-English, Malayalam, Hindi-and can understand and speak
and bit of Tamil.

Visitors to the latest exhibition at the Singapore Discovery Centre will
be greeted with a vision of what a fictional dystopian Singapore in 2032
could look like.

The display includes an abandoned MRT station, the last specimen of
Singapore's national flower Vanda Miss Joaquim, and a brand-new unsold
smartphone priced at $100,000 - a sign of a rapid increase in the price
of goods due to an economic crisis.

The 8th Singapore Art Week was more confident than ever, although buying
activity remained modest

AT THE DE:VOTED art show at Helutrans, artist Urich Lau had set up a 360
degree video camera that captured in real time all the visitors from all
angles. The image was simultaneously projected onto the walls of the
room, and sometimes compressed or contorted to heighten the sense of
threat and instability.

India, Jan. 24 -- MSMEs need more incentives

At a time when the economy of India is experiencing a slowdown, the
country is hoping for a balanced Union Budget by Finance Minister
Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1. The middle-class is anticipating
relief in income tax and Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) are
looking for incentives. It is also crucial for the FM to formulate
policies which ascertain 6.5 per cent real GDP growth for the fiscal
year 2020-21.

Sara Ali Khan's fashion game has always been top-notch. The actress can
slay in anything right from comfy casuals to traditional outfits. She
always gives out major fashion goals whenever she steps out for a public
appearance. The *millennial* actress who is currently busy with the
promotions of her upcoming film 'Love Aaj Kal' was snapped last night in
the city donning an uber-cool chic look. In the photos, we can see Sara
wearing a neck yellow tube top with blue short denim and a pair of fancy
slippers. She was also seen carrying a black bag on her shoulder. The
actress was all smiles as she got papped by the shutterbugs. On the work
front, Sara will be seen sharing the screen space with Kartik Aaryan in
Imitiaz Ali's 'Love Aaj Kal'. The film is slated to release on February
14, 2020. Later, she will be seen in David Dhawan's 'Coolie No.1'
alongside Varun Dhawan.

LAGOS, Nigeria — Services at The Tribe Lagos church in Nigeria are held
in a chic, urbane cafe resembling many others like it in the area: a
long, fairly spacious room with stark white walls and light casings made
from woven raffia palms.

MANILA, Philippines — The Anti-Red Tape Authority (ARTA) has reminded
the local government units (LGUs) of Taguig and Pasig to improve their
business permit system by putting in place a business one-stop shop
(BOSS) in compliance with the Ease of Doing Business Act.

ARTA director general Jeremiah Belgica said the two cities have yet to
fully comply with provisions of Republic Act 11032 or the Ease of Doing
Business and Efficient Government Delivery Service Act, following
on-the-spot checks on the business permit and licensing office conducted
by the agency.

There are some deep, agonising questions that every young woman grows up
wrestling with. Would I make a good spy? (Doubtful. I can't even get a
Brazilian wax, so I'd be rubbish under torture.) Should I jack all this
underpaid-*millennial*-gig-economy stuff in and become a stripper?
(Again doubtful, given how much I hate perspex footwear.) And, given
that I grew up in England, would I marry a royal?

I've given it a lot of thought over the years, especially during times
of deep quarter-life crisis when all career options must be considered
carefully, but I've always decided against it.

Around 5 billion of the world’s citizens are now of the *millennial* or
‘gen z’ generations. They’ve grown up with many technologies and tools
that didn’t exist 10 to 15 years ago.

This rapidly growing group of tech-savvy youngsters coming into the
workforce represents a significant challenge for CIOs and other senior
tech execs who must strike the right balance between security and access.

Millennials are making more major purchases than any other group, but
they are doing their research first.

According to a new consumer survey from TD Bank, millennials made, on
average, nearly four major purchases in the past year, while Gen X and
baby boomers combined averaged just 2.8 major purchases during that
time. Survey data also indicates that millennials are more thoughtful
about these major purchases in that they spend more time, on average,
researching major purchases (4.4 hours) than any other group.

A study of environmental, social and governance (ESG) practice in the
mining sector that examined the top-50 listed mining companies by market
capitalization and the world’s 20 largest institutional investors says
much more work needs to be done to put ESG front and centre in the industry.

“Despite the compelling business case for ESG, and its acceptance as a
critical issue by essentially all mining companies, there is no company
that stands out as the undisputed leader in ESG performance,” concluded
a report by Egon Zehnder, a global management consulting and executive
search firm. “Even the world’s top mining companies still experience
fatalities, spillages, community strife, conflict with non-governmental
organizations and public relations disasters.”

Today’s young adults are starting their lives on drastically different
financial footing than their parents did decades ago. Necessities cost
far more and wages have flattened; as a result, many young families have
to dig through mountains of debt before they can even think about
growing their wealth.

A data point from the Federal Reserve, highlighted recently in a special
report on housing by the Economist, underscores the differences between
millennials’ financial trajectory and those of earlier generations: In
1990, baby boomers, whose median age was 35, owned nearly one-third of
American real estate by value.

In order to make the most out of the growing *millennial* workforce and
students flow to the cities, Embassy Group has recently decided to
invest Rs 2,000 crore to set up co-living or shared accommodation
facilities across top six cities in India. The Bengaluru-based real
estate firm, which builds commercial office spaces, residential projects
and also operates WeWork co-working offices in India, announced that the
company will operate its co-living business under the brand 'Olive'. It
plans to launch two centres each in Bengaluru and Chennai this year with
a total of 2500 beds. Its office parks have about almost half million
people more than 60% of that population are migrants.

They have friends at work and good relationships with their managers.
But younger employees still feel alone at the office, according to a new
survey.

More than 80% of employed members of Generation Z—many of whom are just
entering the workforce—and 69% of employed millennials are lonely,
according to a survey of more than 10,400 people, including about 6,000
workers, in the U.S. from health insurer Cigna Corp. Older workers have
lower rates of loneliness; they are also less likely to say they feel
alienated by their co-workers or emotionally distant from colleagues,
the survey found.

I probably should've known I had a problem when I recorded myself
affixing an AirPod to the heel of my dirty sock with packing tape. Or
maybe when I wasted an hour watching people turn Diet Coke bottles into
spray cannons using Mentos. Perhaps the Friday night I spent trying to
record my dog holding an iPhone was a clue.

I'd like to amend the name of the social-video app known as TikTok. How
about TikTok… Ya Don't Stop? The kids won't get the
reference[https://youtu.be/FYHm-B0tnCs?t=250] but at least it'll be
clear what we're all getting into.

Justin Simien understands the value of a compelling story.

Before he broke out with his award-winning indie satire “Dear White
People” in 2014, the 36-year-old American filmmaker worked in publicity,
doing gigs at studios like Paramount and Focus Features. It was this
experience, working on massively successful hits such as “Brokeback
Mountain” and “Paranormal Activity,” that taught Simien the art of
selling an idea to an audience.

SINGAPORE -Visitors entering the latest exhibition at the Singapore
Discovery Centre will be greeted with a vision of what a fictional
dystopian Singapore in 2032 could look like.

The display includes an abandoned MRT station, the last specimen of the
country's national flower Vanda Miss Joaquim, and a brand-new unsold
smartphone priced at $100,000 - a sign of a rapid increase in the price
of goods due to an economic crisis.

More than 80% of Generation Z's member employees, many of whom are just
entering the workforce, and 69% of millennials employed are alone,
according to a survey of more than 10,400 people, including about 6,000,
from the health insurer The US, Cigna Corp, older workers have lower
rates of loneliness, they are also less likely to say that they feel
alienated by their co-workers or emotionally distant from their
colleagues, according to the survey.

For many younger workers, a day at the office comes with a sense of
emptiness and the need to hide their true self, according to the data.
More than 60% of Generation Z respondents (ages 18 to 22) and
"*millennial*" workers, which the survey defined as 23 to 37, have a
close friend at work. However, they find their jobs less significant and
feel more friction between their values and those of their companies,
compared to older workers, according to the survey.

The findings, based on survey results from 1,015
adults[https://www.bankrate.com/banking/savings/financial-security-january-2020/],
also revealed that 37% of Americans would borrow money if they were
faced with an unexpected expense. In addition, 28% of respondents said
they or a close relative had to pay for a big, unexpected expense in the
last year. The average cost of that expense was $3,518. Fifty-nine
percent of households that earn $75,000 or more annually said they would
use savings to pay for unanticipated bills. In addition, the survey
found that 45% of men said they would use their savings to cover
unexpected expenses, compared to 38% of women. Meanwhile, 36% of
millennials would turn to their savings in the event of a $1,000
emergency, compared to 41% to 44% of non-*millennial* adults.

The results of a new
study[http://www.ontariocreates.ca/Assets/Design+Assets/Homepage+Marketing+Panel/Jan+2020/OC+White+Paper+English_FINAL_AODA_2019-12-30.pdf]

agency that provides potential funding and economic development
opportunities for the province's creative industries -- focus on how Gen
Z discovers, consumes and shares culture content, including music, film,
television, art, lifestyle, gaming and literature.

Among other key insights on the music side -- Gen Z's favorite topic,
the study notes -- the results showed that the Gen Z audience is willing
to pay for music and that streaming is the top paid service in that
demographic.

*HD* 	Is CAA membership worth the money? Plus: Be careful what you

A recent e-mail from a reader asked a personal finance question that I
have never heard before, but seems utterly obvious. Is it worth the cost
to join the CAA, the widely used acronym for the Canadian Automobile
Association? I tossed the question out to people in my Twitter community
and here’s what they had to
say[https://twitter.com/rcarrick/status/1214258359618228224] :

For me, the answer is yes. We have had a family membership since the
early 1990s, when one of our cars was a beaten up Plymouth Reliant that
was reliant on regular visits to the local mechanic. The CAA once towed
a different family vehicle from Renfrew, Ont., back to Ottawa and it
rescued us when our car’s battery died one frosty winter evening while
waiting to pick up one of our sons at the bus station.

Like a mythological animal, Ema puts fire in her mouth. Its destructive
capacity is only comparable to its strength to reconstruct what is
ravaging. Fire is a key element in the Chilean's latest film Pablo
Larraín, a new portent of one of Latin America's less conventional and
intelligent filmmakers, capable of surprising with each film. From No,
who delved into the paradoxes of the plebiscite that brought Pinochet to
the end, to Jackie, an intense portrait of the former American first
lady shot in English with Natalie Portman, or The Club, uncomfortable
dissection of a group of paedophile priests. Larraín takes almost
suicidal risks with an astonishing naturalness and bravery. His new film
not only doesn't escape that risk, but goes even further. An
unclassifiable film addressing a controversial issue: the new family models.

Women are increasingly expected to monitor and manage their own fertility

This week, scientists revealed a revolutionary blood test that tells
women how close they are to the menopause. The invention detects levels
of the anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) to predict whether menopause will
arrive in one to two years.

GrubHub is getting crushed by competition, so it's fighting back with a
new service that targets diners who want to pick up their food instead
of having it delivered to them.

GrubHub unveiled new technology -- dubbed Ultimate -- on Thursday that
makes it easier for people to order food to go and track exactly when
the meal will be ready.

<sup class="drop-cap color-accent font-accent">The Forbes Under 30 Voter
Survey, powered by Zogby, the largest polling project of young voters,
shows that Senator Bernie Sanders remains the strong favorite among the
18- to 29-year-old electorate, with 32% support among likely Democratic
voters. The real surprises come after that. The only other candidate in
double digits: former Vice President Joe Biden, at 16%, undermining the
conventional wisdom that he lacks support among this segment. Elizabeth
Warren garners just 9%—a virtual tie with the race’s newcomer,
billionaire former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, and barely ahead of
social entrepreneur Andrew Yang (8%).

The winter version of the UK’s biggest reality show should have steamed
up the cold nights. Instead, we’re – whisper it – bored

Winter Love Island. It sounded like the dream: the UK’s most popular
reality show, only, er, in the winter. There would be snow, presumably,
with Mallorca replaced by a Sloaney ski resort, perfect for fondue and
fondling. What a vision, what a plan. Besides, it was surely time to
shake up the show that turned ITV2 from an insomnia cure to a hit
channel, as it morphed from niche concern to national obsession.

1. Fraud/Anomaly Detection & automating inputs

Machine Learning based applications have evolved from email spam and
malware filtering to predicting and recommending actions. 2020 will see
companies benefitting from Machine Learning/Deep Learning's real-time
financial applications such as fraud/anomaly detection, self-auditing
systems and suggestions based on past orders/transactions. The
consolidation of operations will prevent leakage and mistakes. Ramco's
validation and defaulting application uses previous transactions as
references to ensure consistency of input values and warn of an anomaly.
It can also recognise a user's needs based on factors such as supplier
address and shipment priority, filling in freight details on user's
behalf and automating inputs.

Younger workers are likelier to seek new cities for career advancement.
Here are the Top 10 metro areas based on job-relevant factors.

Millennials, still in the earlier stages of their careers and less
likely to be encumbered by the needs of children or spouses, may
strongly consider relocation as they climb the professional ladder. But
where are the best cities to work?

We realized we made a mistake when the pineapple came out. Sliced
lengthwise, spread on a bed of lettuce leaves and stuffed with half the
contents of the Monterey Bay Aquarium, the tropical fruit looked like
something you’d pass around during a luau.

But here we were, sitting by the window staring out onto a Spanish
breezeway of red bricks, the only thing that stood between us and Oracle
Road. The table was filling up fast and they hadn’t even brought out the
chorizo burger yet ...

One of the biggest stories of the past decade in personal finance is how
expensive housing – both owning and renting – has become in some cities.
It’s a challenging story to cover as a personal-finance columnist
because there aren’t any easy solutions beyond saving longer or moving
to the suburbs.

Oh, wait. It seems that young adults are finding a solution to expensive
housing by moving in together. A recent story in
Flare[https://www.flare.com/sex-and-relationships/canada-high-rent-prices-love/]
captures the complications of living and dating in an expensive city.
One young woman talks about meeting a guy who made it clear within the
first month of dating that his goal was to move in with a partner.
Another shared her story of moving in with a boyfriend for
housing-related reasons, even though she didn’t see them as being at the
“moving-in-together stage” of their relationship.

SAY what you like about Tim Martin go for it, he won't mind. But don't
say he isn't up for a fight.

For months he's been battling the City corporate governance crowd, an
increasingly preposterous group of people who should find proper work.
Or else arrange grand conferences where they set rules for each other
and stop bothering the rest of us.

MEGHAN and Harry may have given up their royal duties, but they are the
still the official patrons for on semideserving cause: ageing
millennials everywhere. The word "*millennial*" was first used by
sociologists to describe the generation born between 1981 and 1996-ish,
but since then it's morphed into a catch-all insult applied to anyone
who drinks coffee or criticises Trump.

Trouble is, the "M" word has been bandied about for so long and with
such enthusiasm that the cohort it refers to can no longer be credibly
stereotyped as clueless young 'uns. When Facebook is mostly for
pensioners and avocado toast is too passé for the Greggs menu, then
clearly millennials are no longer young. The babies of the bunch are
several years out of school, while the top end are pushing 40.

NEW YORK, Jan. 23, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- 5W Public Relations, one of the
15 largest independently-owned PR firms in the U.S., has learned that
health and wellness ranks as the top category *Millennial* consumers are
most likely to save on, determined by their 2020 Consumer Culture
Report. In contrast, experiential purchases ranked first, with things
like electronics, beauty, personal care, shoes & accessories and snacks
falling in the middle.

"Our data shows that 68% of Millennials don't see the importance of
investing in their health early on," said 5WPR CEO and Founder, Ronn
Torossian. "Younger generations are attracted to instant gratification.
They want to spend their money on immediate experiences rather than
invest in their future."

as well as a range of central macro themes impacting client portfolios.

“For the first time since WWII we sense a shift in which climate and the

existential questions.” says Steen Jakobsen, Chief Economist and CIO at

An overwhelming majority of young voters, 58.6%, believe President Trump
abused power and obstructed Congress, the two charges he faces in
America’s third-ever impeachment trial, according to the exclusive new
Forbes Under 30 Voter Survey, Powered By Zogby. Only 32.8% of those
surveyed, who were all between 18 and 29 years old, do not think Trump
is guilty. The remaining 8.7% said they were not sure.

A slightly smaller majority thought Trump should be removed from office.
Of the 1,014 people who completed the survey, 54.2% said Trump should be
removed from office, which would make him the first president in U.S.
history to ever suffer that fate. A similar percentage of respondents
who thought Trump was not guilty, 37%, disagreed that he should be
removed from office. And 8.8% percent said they did not know.

In case you're missing the extended Awkwafina moment now in progress,
some background: She was born Nora Lum in 1988, raised in Queens. Using
a stage name that has surely irked the lawyers at PepsiCo, she launched
a career as a provocative rap artist, bringing forth the persona of her
alter ego - an outspoken, sometimes hilariously boisterous
Asian-American woman named Awkwafina.

Her acting career soon took off, too, in such films as "Crazy Rich
Asians" and "Ocean's 8," along with a hosting gig on "Saturday Night
Live" and, this month, a best actress Golden Globe Award for her role in
"The Farewell."

The population of Russia still has a big demand for change, and citizens
have no fear of change. Vladimir Putin heard this request and formalized
in his May decrees. However, the former government did not cope with all
the tasks assigned to it. Now, the new cabinet of ministers is to
achieve changes for the better in the economy and the social sphere.
This was stated in an interview with Izvestia by the VTsIOM General
Director, Valery Fedorov. He spoke about techno-optimists in Russia, the
*millennial* generation and the 2024 election, and also answered
questions about the law on domestic violence, the most popular foreign
politician and the celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Victory.

Corr.: How did the population perceive the resignation of the government?

Whether it's a first relationship for a *millennial* or a second or
subsequent relationship for others including baby boomers and seniors,
these days more and more couples are choosing to live common law rather
than marrying. According to a 2017 census, 21.3% of all couples in
Canada were living common law in 2016 compared to 6.3% in 1981. There is
also a rise in people living common law before marriage. According to
the census, 39% of married people aged 25 to 64 lived common law for an
average of 3.6 years prior to marrying.

There may be a myriad of reasons for living common law depending on
circumstances, but one myth that needs to be unraveled is the notion
that it is simpler not to get married. Common law relationships have a
unique set of considerations.

Behavioral Experts and Air Travel Industry Pros Offer Insight to Data from ExpertFlyer's Seat Alerts App that Clearly Shows Preferred Seat Selection Trending from Aisle to Window 
 

NEW YORK, Jan. 23, 2020 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- For the past several
years, airline passengers seem to have found new meaning to the phrase,
"free to move about the cabin." Seating chart data, including data
collected from ExpertFlyer.com's Seat Alerts feature, show a distinct
trend by passengers shifting from window to aisle seats, and back to
window over the past several years. But why? Aside from the "comfort" of
wedging your head against the window to sleep or avoid the need to
absorb shots to the body from passing beverage carts for the sake of
quick access to the restroom or the overhead bin, what truly motivates
travelers to gravitate toward one seat or another? And why are large
swaths of flyers changing their preference at the same time?

this morning.

The project, called 7INK, will be part of a development called Ink
Block, centered at 300 Harrison Street in Bostons South End
neighborhood. Plans call for suites where lessees can live in groups,
while sharing common rooms. Co-living is only one component of the
project; the building will have 180 units total, which will also include
furnished studios and one-bedroom apartments.

La U.S. imperialist offensive against the peoples of our region is
entering a new phase; in some countries, with clear fascist edges.
Although not the only symptom, America's obsessive eagerness to kill the
peoples of Venezuela and Cuba with hunger and unhealthiness, only to
prevent them from exercising the sacred human right to
self-determination, is a very clear example of this. So is the cynical,
crazy anti-terrorist crusade in Latin America convened this week in
Bogota by Secretary of State Pompeo and Deputy President Duque, holding
hands with his puppet Juan Guaidó.

Precisely because of this hostile and undemocratic context, the
appointment of Luis Arce and David Choquehuanca as candidates for
president and vice president of Bolivia by the Movement for Socialism
(MAS) takes on greater political importance in the elections of 3 May Next.

There is no summer without sunset and for lovers of the best time of the
day, without haste or shortcuts, the sunsets in Punta del Este are
almost insurmountable. The ritual is never the same. Starting at five,
six in the afternoon, the afterbeach begins. The appointment is always
convening, the offer changes according to the location of the parador or
the beach. What is never lacking is good company, something to take,
music and clear the natural setting.

With more than 35 kilometers of beach extension the question that arises
is which offers the best outdoor show. A guide:

As a *millennial* who graduated from college in 2010, in the lingering
wake of the financial crisis, the cultural critic Kyle Chayka haltingly
admits to being a minimalist, but only ''by default.''

When he began writing ''The Longing for Less,'' he was put off by how
minimalism had become commodified -- a smug cure-all that countered
late-capitalist malaise with self-help books by Marie Kondo and seasonal
pilgrimages to The Container Store. His own minimalism was a consequence
of living as an underpaid writer in New York: No basements and no
closets meant no storage space for stuff.

"The Virtuous Midlife Crisis," a Wall Street Journal article about how
today's 40- and 50-somethings are skipping the stereotypical sports car
and Vegas weekend and pushing headlong into fitness and mindfulness
instead, led readers to recount their own midlife reinventions.

Readers wrote about career changes, finding purpose by serving others
and learning to feel grateful for what they have. There was spirited
debate, too: A few said they'd still take the sports car. Here are
edited excerpts of some of their comments.

After the spectacular collapse of Theranos, the "unicorn" Silicon Valley
biotech startup led by *Millennial* CEO Elizabeth Holmes, observers in
academic circles couldn't help but ponder the level of oversight
provided by the company's board of directors.

Holmes was the face of the company, a celebrity executive who helped
push it to a reported $9 billion valuation. But the board included
several high-profile members - including Henry Kissinger and George
Shultz - who are not scientists and may not have understood the faulty
blood-testing technology the company sought to develop.

ITC has announced the launch of a 'Lo Smoke' variant of its incense
brand Mangaldeep. In conversation with Ravi Rayavaram, chief executive
of Matches and Agarbatti Business, ITC, we explore the category, the
trends and the shifts within.

Agarbatti, that indispensable part of puja rituals, are bought solely
for their fragrance. But with fragrance also comes smoke. Adding a new
twist to the product, ITC's agarbatti brand Mangaldeep recently
announced a new 'Lo Smoke' variant. The Unique Selling Proposition (USP)
of the new offering is that it releases 80 per cent less smoke than

Qatar-based broadcaster Al Jazeera has travelled a long and bumpy road
from the early 2000s when it was best known for airing tapes of former
Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.

It now cultivates a loyal youth audience on social media alongside the
satellite channels which have won it both acclaim and scorn.

An ultra-portable notebook with a sleek chassis, stylish design and slim
bezels, not to mention great performance and long battery life—that’s
Acer Swift 3 for you.

There is no doubt mobile phones are very handy and adept at undertaking
basic computing tasks normally performed by laptops, but there’s no
replacing the latter; a number of people (myself included) aren’t yet
ready to give up their slightly larger screens. I reckon that students,
families and professionals who are constantly on the move will love the
stylish and lightweight Acer Swift 3 notebook. It has a 14-inch Full HD
IPS3 screen, comes with plenty of ports and is available in steel gray
and *millennial* pink, weighing 1.19kg. It retails for Rs59,999 and I
have been using it for the past fortnight, here’s a quick lowdown on its
features and performance.
