t was with florid language that Air France unveiled Joon as its
“new-generation travel experience” in September 2017.In a section headed
“Joon is...”, the French flag carrier variously described its new unit
as “a rooftop bar... an entertainment channel... a personal assistant...
a fashion designer”.More specifically, Joon was intended as a disruptive
hybrid of traditional and low-cost airline models that would lure in the
all-important *millennial* demographic – an ambition signalled by its
name, a corruption of “jeune”.But the plans for Joon – or Boost, to use
its original working title – were not driven solely by customer
targeting. Rather, they were drawn up in 2016 as Air France-KLM’s
then-chief executive Jean-Marc Janaillac sought to establish a more
competitive operating platform as a means of resolving costly conflict
between the French airline and its strike-prone aircrew.Failure to
achieve such a resolution would ultimately prompt Janaillac’s
resignation in May 2018.

Though coworking has been top of mind in commercial real estate
operators' minds as the trend settles into secondary markets, local and
national groups in Charlotte show there's no one exact way to "do"
coworking.

With a market that's becoming a bit more crowded locally, as local
coworking names expand and national shops take down more space around
town, much
discussion[https://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/news/2018/08/30/what-the-rise-of-coworking-in-charlotte-means-for.html]
has circulated around what's next for coworking — how does it fare
during a recession, for instance, and how much room for growth is left
in Charlotte?

Before you tackle lofty financial resolutions like paying off debt this
year, do yourself a quick favour and freeze your credit reports. It's
free, doesn't affect your credit score and helps protect your financial
future.

Credit reports summarize your payment history with creditors and are
automatically generated by the three major credit bureaus: Equifax,
Experian and TransUnion. Freezing them prevents fraudsters from opening
a new line of credit using your personal information.

A decade or more ago, all the luxury world could talk about was the
BRICS — Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. But as the
various nations hit political and economic road bumps, the industry’s
attention focused more and more on only China than on the other members
of the quintet.

There are many reasons why the BRICS markets lost some of their allure
over the past few years. Internal turmoil and sanctions in Brazil and
Russia, economic decline in South Africa, and demonetization and a new
goods and services tax in India led to a realignment in business.

Sander van 't Noordende, group chief executive of products at

*Millennial* Movie Fans Cast Their Votes in Top Academy Award(R)
Categories and Also Name the "Biggest Snub"

SANTA MONICA, Calif., Jan. 22, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Atom Tickets, the
social movie ticketing platform, polled *millennial* movie fans, just as
nominations were announced this morning, about which films, artists, and
song should take top honors this Oscar season. Nearly 1,000 votes were
cast for Black Panther and A Star is Born as "Best Picture" with the
former polling ahead of the latter by a less than 2% margin. Millennials
were also asked to vote for the "Biggest Snub" from among the Oscar
nominations announced this morning, with respondents calling out John
Krasinski's omission from the "Best Director" category for his film, A
Quiet Place, as the main oversight from the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences.

Although the housing market has cooled a little in many cities, there’s
still a sense among young adults that they may never own a house. And
so, they ask questions like this one:

Q: “I’m in my early-30s, and am only now starting to think about
(possible) home ownership. How common is it for first-time homeowners to
completely drain their savings to make a good down payment? At this
point in time, that’s what I’m facing, and I’m not sure how ‘normal’ or
financially responsible that would be.”

The indigenous youth who participate in the World Youth Day, gathered in
one voice, demanded respect for their diversity, worldviews and the ways
of living of each one.

In the same way as indigenous peoples recognize that land is the
motherland, that is why they demand the care of the common home so that
all peoples have life and a future to offer to new generations.

Housing affordability, a dreamedof foot ferry to Vancouver, and
transportation challenges were among topics three Nanaimo byelection
candidates faced in a debate on Monday night.

Nanaimo's sprawling urban design has resulted in neighbourhoods where
residents can not walk or ride a bicycle to get a carton of milk but
must drive, said Michele Ney, the Green party's candidate.

Nick Molnar told a Senate inquiry in Brisbane on Tuesday that the
campaign was “not acceptable’’ to his company, which has provided young

There was a time not so long ago when Austin, Texas, was mostly regarded
as a sleepy college town with an abiding appreciation for high-quality
barbecue and live music.

Though it hasn’t lost its appreciation for juicy brisket, the formerly
laid-back state capital - now overrun with *millennial* transplants and
start-ups - has become something else, as well: one of the nation’s
pre-eminent micro-mobility testing grounds.

Lately, in the sparkling-white optimistic glow of the new year, and as
an inevitable trend responding to our tech-saturated,
attention-dissolving personal cultures, "slow" has picked up speed.

In the Wall Street Journal last week, a story about "slow mornings"
included subjects who wake up early to meditate, exercise, work on side
hustles, be alone or "do nothing" (my favourite!) and who say that slow
mornings are "a way to manage stress and find control in anxious,
always-connected times."

Generation alpha, the children of millennials born between 2012 and
2040, promises to play a key role in shaping our society within the next
couple of decades. So what are some of the typical traits we can expect
from this group?

Futurist James Bellini says he wouldn't be surprised if it is a spoilt,
‘me generation' of children living predominantly in a single-parent
household.

pension system. Our new research focuses on the interaction between
saving and pension systems in an aging world. We use data from 80
countries to map public (government) and private savings in countries
over the next 30 years, given their aging populations and the design of

Roles involving beards, tattoos, downward dogs, artisan coffee and no
doubt the odd craft beer are playing an increasingly important role in
the UK economy.

New data pulled together by Indeed shows that the demand for baristas,
according to the numbers of roles advertised on the job board, is more
than four times as great as it was four years ago, while numbers of
opportunities for yoga instructors, bartenders and tattoo artists have
also soared.

China's rapid urbanisation is driving the popularity of island travel
among Chinese tourists, a recent report commissioned by ITB China revealed.

Island escapes have surged in popularity over the past few years, as
beaches are rather rare in China despite its long coastline and are also
often overcrowded during holiday seasons.

A viral essay explaining why so many millennials have trouble completing
mundane tasks has touched a nerve with her burnt-out generaion, says
Meadhbh McGrath

After months of searching and planning, I'm finally moving flat this
week, and it's been a real shock to the system. Yes, there's the stress
of packing up your life and carting a dozen boxes from one side of the
city to the other. But then there's the near-endless list of menial
admin tasks necessitated by a move: register with a GP, get a TV
licence, change the address on my bank account, donate unwanted clothes,
and so on and on and on.

Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich (D) should be ashamed of himself
for his disparaging comments about millennials ["Elrich takes heat for
remark about 'millennials,' " Metro, Jan. 18]. Those are our children he
is talking about - lifelong county residents who graduated from
Montgomery County schools. Mr. Elrich made it most clear there is no
room in his county vision for them.

It is no wonder they won't come back. Some may think all that money in
public education is wasted because our graduates cannot afford to or
don't want to live here anymore. I guess Mr. Elrich will be happy only
when the county is populated by the old and the poor. A great tax base
that will provide.

Flexible working is becoming a must for many. One recent report found a
quarter of UK workers have refused a job due to a lack of flexibility.
This number jumps to 40% for *millennial* workers for whom work-life
balance and flexible working is key when evaluating a job prospect.

*millennial* ennui and the sometimes lonely, sometimes exhilarating
experience of youth.

Daiwa House Industry Co., Ltd. has begun development projects for
city-type rental housing primarily targeting the *millennial* generation
residing in the states of Tennessee and Arizona in the US. This is a
project that the company is undertaking through one of its group
companies, “Daiwa House California, Inc.,” which is conducting this
jointly with a US company called “Akara Partners” (State of Illinois),
which has been engaged in real-estate investment and rental-housing
developments. Daiwa House has been contributing capital equivalent to
90% of the total project costs. These are the first projects for Daiwa
House to undertake in these two states.

Erykah Badu needs to watch that documentary. And choose her words more
carefully.

@alysSAWRAH, criticizing the singer for her comments on R. Kelly during
her Chicago show Saturday. Badu questioned what would happen if "one of
the people that was assaulted by R. Kelly grows up to be an offender."
On Sunday, Badu clarified her comments, tweeting that she loves Kelly
(who is accused of sexual abuse) "unconditionally" but doesn't support
his "poor choices."

The mood in Varanasi was pro-Modi but a certain ambivalence has crept in

At the gargantuan venue for the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas (PBD) in
Varanasi, two women posed for a selfie in front of large cutouts of the
Kashi Vishwanath temple. A young man was busy making a boomerang video
of a tea vendor offering the hot beverage in ‘kulhads’. But as soon as
the question of the upcoming Lok Sabha election was brought up, there
was a tiny shift in energy. “I’m not sure I know enough” was an
oft-repeated phrase among the *millennial* visitors to the 15th edition
of an event aimed at bringing together the Indian diaspora.

Financial advice firms need to embrace digital technology to reach
next-gen investors and attract young advisers, but that doesn't mean
fintech is just for kids.

Existing technology vendors and startups are recognizing an opportunity
to innovate the way in which advisers serve older clients nearing or in
retirement, a market that could be even more profitable than coveted
millennials.

Regional Chamber of Commerce, delivered the forecast. A panel of five
industry experts provided insight and answered questions from the
audience. The event was held at the Hilton San Diego Resort & Spa on
Mission Bay. These excerpts and those of the panelists on the following
pages are edited for clarity and brevity.

More than nine in 10 Generation Z and *millennial* children of
millionaires say the most important thing they will inherit is their
parents' values, not their wealth, according to a recent survey by Wells
Fargo Private Bank. More than four out of five (84 percent) say they
want to sustain and build on their family's legacy.

"This is such important data for families to have and act on," said
Katherine Dean, head of family dynamics for Wells Fargo Private Bank.
"We hear all the time what parents are talking to their children about,
but rarely do we hear from the children. These are the generations
responsible for carrying on the family legacy, so it makes a big
difference when families collaborate and communicate their shared values."

Revenge may be a dish best served cold, but making your critics eat

who dared to doubt you.

L.A.'s most visual symbol of architecture for the arts has to be
downtown's shiny, splashy, ultramodern Frank Gehry-designed Walt Disney
Concert Hall, which opened its doors in 2003 and is home to the Los
Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra. Or perhaps it is architect Richard
Meier's starkly contemporary, white limestone design for the Getty
Center in Brentwood, often credited with putting Los Angeles on the
international arts map when it opened in 1997.

However, in 2019, two new Los Angeles arts institutions are taking a
sharp detour from contemporary design by choosing to renovate historic
buildings over new construction.

One marvels at the ability of Microsoft to be as successful as it is,
despite having taken so many missteps over the years.

Its latest has been its ill-judged entry into the mobile phone market,
taking on the even bigger beasts of Apple and Google. Its
one-size-fits-all Windows 10 operating system was supposed to work in
the same way on pocket handsets as on full-sized PCs - but for many,
that prospect was more a threat than a promise.

The world needs the leadership of public company CEOs to ameliorate the
impacts of social and political problems, BlackRock Chairman and CEO
Laurence D. Fink said in his annual letter to corporations the firm
invests in.

In a Jan. 15 letter obtained by Pensions & Investments, Mr. Fink wrote:
"Unnerved by fundamental economic changes and the failure of government
to provide lasting solutions, society is increasingly looking to
companies, both public and private, to address pressing social and
economic issues."

There are some things that advisers just shouldn't say to millennials
when they are discussing financial planning, according to Douglas A.
Boneparth, president and founder of Bone Fide Wealth and co-author of
"The *Millennial* Money Fix." He recommends advisers stay away from
doing any of these

1. Ask why we aren't saving for retirement. Short-term goals, like
student-loan debt, cash reserves and home buying, are higher up on the
priority list.

The nearly decade-long bull market combined with the *millennial*
generation's insatiable wanderlust are fueling the FIRE movement — and
advisers' concerns about it.

Financial blogs, podcasts and internet message boards have sprung up to
educate wannabes about "financial independence, retire early." There's
even a documentary film in the works, "Playing with FIRE," set to be
released this year.

In a popular BuzzFeed
article[https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/millennials-burnout-generation-debt-work],
Anne Helen Petersen describes how millennials (people born between 1981
and
1996[http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/01/17/where-millennials-end-and-generation-z-begins/])
became "the burnout generation". She describes some of the stark
consequences of edging towards burnout and identifies what she calls
"errand paralysis", marked by a struggle to do even simple or mundane tasks.

President Rodrigo Duterte on December 20, 2018, signed into law Republic
Act 11165 known as the 'Telecommuting Act' also referred to as the 'Work
From Home' Law. This new law recognizes that technological developments
have opened up new and alternative avenues for employees to carry out
their work, such as telecommuting and other flexible work arrangements
(Section 2, RA 11165 ).

'Telecommuting' refers to a work arrangement that allows an employee in
the private sector to work from an alternative workplace with the use of
telecommunication and/or computer technologies (Section 3).

MEXICO CITY, January 21 (THE UNIVERSAL) .- There are beverages that
deserve special recognition, such as pulque, *millennial* drink and even
the gods, they say there. Can you imagine a museum dedicated to this
delicious elixir? Well, thanks to the work of the National Association
of Traditional Pulquerias (ANPT), Mexico City (CDMX) will have a Museum
of Pulque and Pulquerias. Since December, through the Facebook account
of Traditional Pulquerias, there was talk of the inauguration of a space
dedicated to drinking from the maguey. And although no more details were
given, we all suspected ... was near the opening of a pulque museum. The
new venue at the CDMX will open its doors on February 8th. Although in
its official site we can only see the legend: "Soon we will be online",
in your Facebook account and promise many surprises. In the Museum of
Pulque and the Pulquerías you will be able to know from the history
until the process of elaboration of the drink considered the "white gold".

Along with the rise of death-inducing pollution levels, and obviously,
global warming (Trump won't agree, neither will our leaders closer at
home) another trend fast gaining traction, or dare we say friction, in
these 'Sanskari' times is the dawn of a new sexual identity, the
Digisexuals.

Not to be confused with Doremon (although Digisexuals are mostly from
Japan), although anime definitely has a role to play in this, this new
breed of brave humans are going where no human has gone before.

It no longer is a taboo for men to take care of their appearance. Gone
is the mindset that men are not interested in anything more than basic
grooming options. In its place is a more evolved understanding that,
given the opportunity, men want to buy products that help them look and
feel their best.

As assortments have changed, so too has the preferred destination for
men to buy their grooming products. According to observers, the category
— once dominated by brick-and-mortar stores — is seeing business slowly
gravitate toward online merchants.
