A year is built one day at a time. It’s the busy Tuesdays when you never
have a moment and the lazy Sundays when you can finally relax.

Focusing on small, cumulative actions can take you far, whether you want
to train for a marathon, clean out your garage or start a hobby.

Molson Coors has launched an activation in the US centred around its
lower-abv beer, as it looks to tap into trends towards reduced alcohol
intake in January.

The campaign, called Dry-ish January, features Miller64 - a 2.8% abv
beer that contains 64 calories per serve. The push is fronted by actor
Nicholas Braun, who stars in the brand's Dry-ish January social media ads.

In line with its customer first philosophy, Toyota Kirloskar Motor in
order to support dealer partners has been gradually liquidating BS-IV
stocks across India to maintain a lean inventory and not put any excess
burden on dealerships before the shift to BS-VI in April 2020.

Thanks to the customers support the stocks of BS-IV has been steadily
decreasing without offering huge discounts/offers for its products.

CULVER CITY, Calif. — On a Wednesday morning last fall, several
executives at Sweetgreen, the fast-casual salad chain, gathered around a
conference table at their headquarters here. They were discussing a new
store format, called Sweetgreen 3.0, that had recently been introduced
in New York City after two years of planning.

At Sweetgreen’s other 102 locations, customers brave queues that, at
peak lunch, can make T.S.A. lines look tame. Up front, employees
assemble Harvest Bowls, Kale Caesars and infinite customized variants
from a spread of freshly prepared ingredients, in a ritual that has
become a hallmark of the modern midday meal.

This time last year, one couldn’t move for Marie Kondo. Known as KonMari
to her fans, the Japanese pop-guru of
minimalism[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/on-demand/0/could-marie-kondos-magical-tidying-have-come-anywhere-japan/]

Domestic wineries are set to enjoy their own Roaring Twenties in the
decade ahead

Despite concerted marketing efforts from the wine industry, Nielsen data
shows millennials are drinking more spirits and beer as well as
embracing cannabis. For them, for now, wine is an afterthought. As a
result, you can expect to see more premium wines in cans and other
packaging innovations made to shift standard – some might say, elitist –
marketing practices to appeal to emerging consumers. These won't be
novelty products.

Increased transparency in beauty products, a return to suiting and more.
Caitlin Agnew reports on the fashion and beauty trends to expect

THE REVOLUTION WILL BE WORN The environmental impact of the fashion
industry has been less obvious than that of, say, fossil fuels, but in
2020, this wastefulness is certainly no longer a secret. Imran Amed,
founder and chief executive of Business of Fashion, says one of the
biggest challenges of the next decade will be for the industry to figure
out its role in solving the continuing climate emergency. Where other
heavily polluting industries have obvious answers, such as the electric
car, for example, fashion has yet to establish that solution. “There's
this kind of existential question, which is, how does the fashion
industry exist and continue to thrive and grow while also addressing the
very urgent crisis that we find ourselves in?" Amed says.

Cooking, food-delivery services scream at us, must be avoided, as it's
an unworthy drag to millennials' inclination to hustle. I can't
understand this bit of dystopian nihilism; cooking is my hustle. Making
big dinners and saving the leftovers for lunch has saved me untold
dollars, and I can avoid single-use plastics. Often, my cooking starts
with the centrepiece of my kitchen: the classic Le Creuset in gorgeous
flame orange. More than a decade ago, my aunt gifted me hers and it
became the original canvas for my passion for cooking. Even after it
cracked last year when I knocked it off a high table (I was staging it
for an Instagram photo – I am still a *millennial*, after all), its
warranty had my back with a 50-per-cent discount on my next oven. I'm
looking forward to giving it to my kids one day. Hopefully, cooking
isn't punishable by death by then.

We are lonely and afraid. The Internet, the social media with their
commentary columns force us into forms of self-representation that we
often don't quite see through ourselves, but which we nevertheless carry
out. The more beautiful, better and wiser side of our ego, which we want
to create on profile pages, in reality escapes us, disappears behind the
shimmering of the touch screen.

RGOD preserve us from "woke" public servants. The latest to spout

In what one newspaper accurately bulls-eyed as "gnarled logic", he
bafflingly states that the Lake District needs to "confront its bias
against *millennial* and non-white visitors who are put off by its
backwardly rugged terrain".

Los Angeles, Jan 4 (PTI) Actor Margot Robbie has revealed that to
prepare for her role in "Bombshell", she created a fake Twitter account

The 29-year-old actor portrays Kayla Pospisil in the film which is set
around Fox News chief Roger Ailes' fall from grace over multiple
accusations of sexual harassment.

Megan Hellerer quit a six-figure job at Google to become a career coach
for high-flying women. She transformed the future of Alexandria
Ocasio-Cortez, left, the new star of the Democratic Party. Can she do
the same for former Grazia editor Natasha Pearlman?

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is America's second most talkedabout
politician, behind only Donald Trump. Eighteen months ago, the youngest
woman to serve in the United States Congress was unheard of outside a
tight-knit group of political activists. She was 28, from a Hispanic
background in the Bronx. When she was growing up, her mother had cleaned
houses and driven a school bus to make ends meet. Ocasio-Cortez worked
in a bar to supplement her income as a political activist. Now AOC - as

We're not here to deal with what Lin-Manuel Miranda calls "crazy
hypotheticals." For instance, from the grapevine: The stage adaptation
of the 1992 Whitney Houston vehicle "The Bodyguard"? No formal
announcement yet.

On the other hand, our 2020 theater calendar already has 24 items all
firmed up. What are we looking forward to the most? Here's a list of 10

It seems that when it comes to the future of stock investing traditional
institutions like banks and stock brokers will soon be completely
replaced by fintech start-ups that outdo each other in attracting young
customers by offering them low-fee and easy-to-use investing
opportunities in brands they know, love and trust, writes Stephanie
Brennan, founder & CEO of Evarvest.

ANDHRA PRADESH Memorable acting, empathy, brisk pace, topicality work in
favour of Bombshell In a television newsroom — with an obsession with
ratings, high-pressure turnovers and demanding deadlines — toxic work
culture is inevitable. “TV is a visual medium,” is an almost daily — if
not an hourly — reminder by screeching editors to anyone who may dare to
prioritise substance over imagery. When the sleazy and powerful CEO of
Fox News, Roger Ailes (John Lithgow), who was fired for sexual
harassment in 2016, repeatedly uses the same line in Bombshell in the
guise of boosting business (“viewers want more legs”), it cuts deep. The
atmosphere of internalised sexism, vanity and ‘it is what it is’
attitude, not only forms a fertile ground for sexual harassment but also
sets a precedent for silence, under the garb of ‘accepted work culture’.
Bombshell aptly demonstrates how these microaggressions are not just
alarm bells but problems in themselves.

COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU Technology in education, particularly in
classrooms, was changing the way the teaching-learning happened but it
could not replace teachers, Nandini Rangaswamy, Chairperson, GRG
Institutions, said at the inauguration of Edu Intec 2020, an
exhibition-cum-conference the Codissia had organised here on Friday.

“There is a fundamental shift in learning process. The *millennial* do
not want to learn by rote; they want to learn at their own pace, place,
on their choice. Basically, they want to choose what, when, where, from
whom and how to learn. This has largely been aided by technology. But no
way the technology can replace teachers.”

Dynamism and the ability to spot and jump on trends are some of the
hallmarks of a proactive brand. Marketing scholars establish that there
is a connection between consumers behaviour and success of a brand, as
these determine brands’ marketing dynamics. They, in turn, influences
the thought process put behind a brand’s marketing initiatives.

Bright and bouncy until it turns grim, Bombshell is a fictionalised
account of the women who brought down Roger Ailes, the chairman and
chief executive of Fox News. Helped bring him down is probably more
accurate given that he was ousted by Rupert Murdoch, who founded Fox
News in 1996 before handing the reins to Ailes. Since then, the network
has become a ratings powerhouse and hothouse of right-wing talking
points, a sea of white faces and dolled-up women in skirts and high
heels. Ailes is now gone but the talking points, high ratings, skirts
and heels remain.

MEXICO CITY (AP) — Spanish writer Javier Castillo, from the popular
mystery logy "The Day You Lost Your Sanity," began writing about teenage
tales, but everyone told him that it would be very difficult to live
from selling books and that writing was not a job.

He did business studies and worked as a financial consultant for six
years, but never stopped making stories as a hobby, until one day he had
a dream, which is the opening scene of "The Day He Lost His Sanity" and
thought it was really a good start for a ninth The. Thus he ventured to
write a long-breathed account on the train journey to work.

that is now exploring traditional sarees, and yet want to add their
unique stamp to it. With sarees becoming the flavour of every season,

As much as this columnist might come across to Martin Place's mandarins
as arrogant, supercilious, callous and any other adjectives that
describe megalomaniacal fund managers, one of my greatest passions is,
in fact, engaging with, and trying to understand, people.

These interactions do, after all, define our human experience. I often
tell the 22 executives who work for me that they're "family". If the
typical Aussie toiler works a 12-hour day and sleeps six hours, then
they spend almost half their waking life with their teammates. If these
folks are not akin to family, you are probably with the wrong tribe. As
Stevie Cohen might quip, we live to work, not work to live, right? Tell
that to an entitled *Millennial*!

Released in 2000 and celebrated by international-horror nerds via
videotapes passed around like viruses, Takashi Shimizu’s Ju-on helped
usher in a wave of modern Japanese creepfests that slowly made their way
west. The title translated as something like “The Curse”; it would
eventually be better known as The Grudge. Along with 1998’s The Ring,
the film (and the numerous related series, sequels, quasi-remakes, and
brand-name bastardizations) was the most recognizable ambassador for a
genre folks dubbed J-Horror. By the time Sam Raimi and producer Roy Lee
enlisted Shimizu and noted genre cinematographer Hideo Yamamoto to do
the English-language remake in 2004 — in which Buffy herself, Sarah
Michelle Gellar, is stalked by pale-skinned phantoms throughout Tokyo —
audiences were primed for what these films brought to the table.

story, she dives deep into research. In the case of her “Bombshell”
character, Kayla Pospisil — a fictional composite created by

studied the Fox News programs she would have watched, and created a
Twitter account to follow the social media antics of conservative
*millennial* women. She worked with an acting coach to trace Kayla’s
emotional journey, and a movement coach to create her physicality. It
all paid off: Robbie is nominated in the supporting actress category at
Sunday’s Golden Globes, as well as for outstanding performance by a
female actor in a supporting role at the Screen Actors Guild Awards.

Margot Robbie thought her three-year stint on Australian soap Neighbours
would be the pinnacle of her screen career.

The Academy Award-nominated actress, 29, is now one of the most
in-demand stars in Hollywood, but previously believed her role as Donna
Freedman would be biggest part she would ever get.

The University of B.C. could face a lawsuit from a free speech club
after cancelling a potentially controversial speaking event at the end
of January, citing "safety and security."

However, a free-expression expert said he believes the school isn't
stifling free speech, as the Free Speech Club is alleging, and doesn't
have a duty to host an event if it isn't part of the university's
academic mission.

PORTLAND, Maine — Catalogues, those glossy paper-and-ink offerings of
outdoor apparel, kitchenware and fruit baskets, are not yet headed for
the recycling bin of history.

Until recently, the future appeared grim for the mailbox-stuffers. A
one-two punch of postal rate increases and the Great Recession had
sharply cut their numbers. Common wisdom had everything retail-related
moving online.

LOS ANGELES - Television ... now more than ever: To paraphrase the
satirical film studio slogan of Robert Altman's "The Player," TV's
dominant mode these days is the avalanche, the deluge, the endless
binge. But even amid the clutter of 500-some scripted and countless
unscripted series, there's plenty to be excited about, including
originals from nascent (or still-to-be-launched) platforms like Apple
TV+, HBO Max and Quibi. Let the Times TV team help you plan your viewing
schedule with this list of our 20 most anticipated new and returning
shows of 2020.

For all the negativity surrounding my chosen profession, ag
communications is one facet of journalism that I'm tremendously
fortunate to have stumbled upon over 20 years ago. In preparing to write
the story you'll read here on the California Agriculture Leadership
Program, I spoke with several people who make me optimistic about an
industry peppered with pessimism.

There's no denying the laundry list of challenges facing American
agriculture and farmers today, and growers in the West may well be at
the epicenter. With such an onslaught of regulatory constraints sown in
California, it's not difficult to be bearish. Yet for all there is to be
concerned about, a new sense of optimism was borne from chatting with
graduates of the California Agriculture Leadership Program.

Impeachment watch: No More Shoes Will Drop

"The more impeachment looks like an exercise in partisan futility,â€
predicts James Antle at The National Interest, "the less likely it is to
command the public's attention and garner the support of independents.â€
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's stalling gives the game away. "While
Democrats Â­insistâ€ they're delaying "to avoid a 'Potemkin impeachment
trial,' implicit in some of their arguments is a concession that the
Trump-Ukraine case isn't the slam-dunk they imagine.â€ Stalling lets
them wait "for various other shoes to potentially drop. Except this is
precisely the strategy that failed in the Trump-Russia investigation.â€
There, "Democrats and Never Trumpers fervently hoped special counsel
Robert Mueller would uncover something much worse.â€ He didn't, and
Democrats' rush to impeach over Ukraine anyway has proved to be similar
"political theater.â€

Stop saying you’re not a ‘numbers person’

It’s no secret that Americans struggle when it comes to working with
numbers. Although the United States educational system lags other
nations in a number of subject areas, our performance in STEM and
numbers-heavy subjects often fares the worst. The U.S. ranks in the
bottom
15%[https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/02/15/u-s-students-internationally-math-science/]
of wealthy developed nations in math. And only
40%[http://leadershipblog.act.org/2018/10/math-readiness-drops-to-14-year-low.html]
of students graduate high school with the numbers skills they’ll need to
be able to succeed in college.

As we enter 2020 with New Year's resolutions in mind, would you consider
joining Jordan Peterson and his daughter, Instagram wellness influencer
Mikhaila Peterson's extreme diet of only red meat?

For only $80 a month (a "New Year, new me" sale promoted on her
Instagram), you can learn how to find wellness through eating like the
Petersons, which consists of "solely (eating) ruminant meat (beef, lamb,
goat, etc.), salt and water." No carbs, no vegetables, not even oil. She
says that "thousands" of people who have taken part in this diet have
reported "complete remissions of autoimmune, psychological and digestive
illnesses, as well as significant improvements to cognitive, emotional
and physical functions."

Listed here are the 5 key mistakes most SME's and MSME's make and how
these can be avoided with the help of a business consultant or mentor:

SME's have a significant contribution to the Indian GDP and growth and,
as per a GoI report ‘MSME At A Glance', SME's account for around 6.11%
of the manufacturing GDP and 24.63% of Service sector GDP. The sector
accounts for 45% of the total Indian manufacturing output and 40% of
India's total exports and currently employs about 106 million people –
amounting to 40% of India's workforce, which is second only to the
agricultural sector.

Before 2009, Canadians looking to place their money in a tax-efficient
investment vehicle had one option: the registered retirement savings
plan (RRSP). Since then, the introduction of the tax-free savings
account (TFSA) has given financial advisors and investors plenty to mull
over.

That’s because each vehicle has its own unique benefits and can help
investors achieve their goals. Sometimes the products can be used in
conjunction. There’s no shortage of ways for advisors and investors
looking to make the most of RRSPs and TFSAs.

In D.C. Dream Day, we ask our favorite people in the area to tell us how
they would spend a perfect day in the District. When comedian Tim
Kardashian threw together the Unofficial Correspondents' Dinner in April
at the Comedy Loft of DC, he imagined the political roast as a one-off
event. But with a warm reception came loftier ambitions for Kardashian
and his comedic cohorts. So they decided to reunite as a comedy troupe,
called the Constituents. Over the past six months, they've donned wigs
and suits to lampoon various political figures in shows around the
District, including a satirical Democratic debate and a roast of the
Republican Party.

MOVIES BOMBSHELL

Bombshell is the chronicle of the sexual harassment accusations that
forced Fox News founding CEO Roger Ailes to resign in disgrace. Charlize
Theron stars as Megyn Kelly who worked at Fox News under the thumb of
Ailes (John Lithgow.) Another Fox anchor, Gretchen Carlson (Nicole
Kidman), is suffering her own indignity at the hands of their
misogynistic boss and erstwhile mentor. Meanwhile, a new hire named
Kayla (Margot Robbie) is making her wide-eyed way through a newsroom she
can't wait to conquer as a self-described Evangelical *millennial*.
Bombshell is crisp, lucid and pacey. ***

HAPPY New Year everyone. We get buoyed at the start of any new year,
especially one that has been talked about so much, with Malaysia’s
Vision 2020 that was instituted all those years ago.   On Jan 1, I
listened earnestly to one of my all-time favourite songs, “Feeling Good”
by Nina Simone. The start of the song has lyrics that go: “It’s a new
dawn, it's a new day, it’s a new life for me, ooh… and I’m feelin’
good.”  It is the new year and it is a new dawn.  As you read this, I am
sure you are slowly recovering from all the revelry. And, of course, I
am sure your mobile phone and social media feeds were inundated with new
year greetings.   But really, what do you want from your career and
work-life this year?  For my final training programme of the year, I was
invited to speak to 78 teachers at Kolej Tingkatan Enam Desa Mahkota
last Friday. While it was daunting to address the principal and her
academic staff, I also found it quite empowering.

NEW DELHI, Jan. 3 -- One of the defining moments of 2019 came almost at
the end of the year: Young students from universities across the country
out protesting against the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act
(CAA) and raising slogans in solidarity with colleagues who faced the
brunt of police brutalities. These protests are arguably the biggest
pan-India protests the country has witnessed since the anti-corruption
agitation of 2011, which led to the formation of a new political outfit,
the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), and helped a three-time chief minister,
Narendra Modi, to stake claim to national leadership.

And if social media platforms Facebook and Twitter were the key vehicles
of mobilization eight years ago during the anti-corruption movement,
photo-sharing app Instagram and short video sharing app TikTok appeared
to have replaced them in these protests.

NEW DELHI, Jan. 3 -- Whenever I discuss my research on Indian
millennials, most people assume I'm talking about the social-media
addicted youth they see in Delhi or Mumbai, glued to their smartphones
and in pursuit of instant gratification. While that image might fit a
very small minority of millennials, reality tells a starkly different story.

Born between 1981 and 1996, millennials grew up in the midst of rapid
social, cultural, and economic change. The forces of economic
liberalization, introduced in 1984, but unleashed in 1991, changed the
nature of the economy and ushered in unprecedented levels of foreign
investment, which is why we are told that liberalization 'transformed'
India.

WHAT A DIFFERENCE a decade makes. Smartphones, streaming TV, social
media, influencers, memes and dating apps have completely changed the
way we connect and consume information. Dramatic social and political
changes involving women's rights (#MeToo, Time's Up), LGBTQ rights (more
countries decrimininalise homosexuality) and minority rights (Black
Lives Matter, Native Lives Matter), among others, have altered the way
we relate to each other. The climate crisis has also modified the way we
live and design our homes. What might the 2020s – or at least the first
half of it – look like? We ask the experts.

As we begin a third decade in our new millennium the fires of change are
burning.

If this was AD1220, when ice core analysis suggests drought was worse,
such awful conditions would have signaled a sure sign that the winds of
a new era had arrived. Trouble is, it's hard to see too far in front
with all the dust and smoke and embers.

fast fashion in a new recruitment campaign aimed at persuading
millennials to join its ranks.

The campaign, unveiled today on TV, radio, Twitter and Facebook, will
promise that an army career provides a longer-lasting confidence boost
than the "quick hits" achieved by engaging with social media or buying
clothes.

Going away? Keep your toiletries in a selection of these fantastic washbags

Every traveller needs a good toiletry bag. You may be the type that can
get by on just a toothbrush and a tube of toothpaste, but the
accessories you need for more than a few days away quickly mount up.
Shampoo and body wash is increasingly provided by hotels these days, but
you still need to travel with your own deodorant, razor, shaving cream,
moisturiser, creams, gels, medication, tablets… for some travellers, the
list goes on and on.

A new year and decade has begun, meaning a new era of fashion is on the
horizon.

2020 is a clean slate for designers, as many break away from streetwear
and ’90s nostalgia to explore sustainability, fluid design and new forms
of utility. And many of the trends align with one another, which will
create a seamless year of fashion.

A month or so ago, when brainstorming ideas for my column, my editor
approached me with a challenge: spend $10 at the local Goodwill and wow
her by upcycling thrift store finds into new treasures.

I am a regular denizen of the thrift store. Many materials for my Sam
Tries Things columns have come from thrift stores, from polka dot fabric
for beeswax food wraps to cookie cutters for plantable seed paper gift
tags. Plus, after learning about the environmental impact of fashion,
nearly 90 percent of my current wardrobe is thrifted.

Sometimes in order to make your life feel a bit more interesting, you
need to break the regular routine and try something different.

That was my thought the day I decided to go into Sweet Tooths in
Renfrew. Not that I don't shake things up every now and then with every
aspect of my life, it was just a day I felt a gnawing urge to sway from
the path a bit.
