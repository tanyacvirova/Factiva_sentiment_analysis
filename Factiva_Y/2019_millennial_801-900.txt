Edgy only in the sense that it is very, very square, Matt Williams's
''Actually, We're ______'' at the Cherry Lane Theater stakes out a
quartet of millennials as they navigate fertility, fidelity and a
nauseating smoothie: pea protein, chia seeds, hemp seeds, kale, active
charcoal, alfalfa sprouts, local bee pollen and bone broth. I belong to
an organic food co-op, and still I gagged.

A queasy comedy of adultery, the play begins as two 30ish couples --
Rachel (Mairin Lee) and Nick (Ben Rappaport), Frank (Gabriel Sloyer) and
Molly (Keren Lugo) -- meet for kombucha and crudités. The chitchat turns
to babies, to religion, to the environment. There are jokes about women
buying shoes and Buddhists self-immolating and a long tirade about how
no one should ever bring a child into a world flooring it toward
catastrophe.

TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Indonesian film director and producer Garin Nugroho
shared his views on the country’s 2019 presidential election, which he
likened it to a soap opera that is filled with drama and social media
arguments.

Director of the film Kucumbu Tubuh Indahku (Memories of My Body) argues
that presidential and vice presidential candidates prefer to attack each
other without offering a proper national concept.

SOARING property prices and fears of violence are forcing younger people
out of cities and towns and into the countryside, research has found.

The average age of those relocating to the country has fallen below 40
for the first time. In 2008 it was 47, but last year it fell to 37.

Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are now more than just
buzzwords. AI and ML are increasingly becoming integrated with our
everyday services, which we may not realize. With connected intelligence
made possible by the Internet-of-Things (IoT), data-based decision
making and control becomes a cakewalk. While individuals get the
windfall benefits of AI and ML by means of better playlist suggestions,
local offers, location and context-relevant content access. On the other
hand, CREs benefit from a centralized view and control of their building
operations and sustainability that helps them make informed decisions to
provide exceptional experiences. This ‘actionable intelligence’ made
possible by the convergence of data, AI, and ML have also started to
revolutionize our living spaces, with buildings and facilities
management space accelerating on the highway of automation. Automation
in buildings is not a recent phenomenon.

London publishers are not favouring mediocre metropolitan writing, but
they are looking elsewhere and to women

Towards the end of his life, sales of my father's novels dried up. The
critics stopped reviewing them. The name Eric Linklater was largely
forgotten by the bookbuying public. He was sad about it, bitter even,
because he thought that some of his later writing was better than
anything he had produced in his youth, when his books were regularly on
the bestseller list. But time, fashion, and the unforgiving world of
publishing had moved on.

In the aftermath of the tragic loss of life in Christchurch on Friday,
the focus needs to be on supporting those who have lost their loved ones
and on fostering a sense of national unity in the face of an heinous act
of terrorism.

Jann Debuts Wednesday, CTV There was a recurring if good-natured debate
on the rural Alberta set of CTV's new comedy Jann back in October.

In interviews with cast and producers and again during a news conference
held for the assembled journalists, it came up time and time again.
Calgary singer-songwriter Jann Arden, who plays a fictionalized version
of herself in the series, would insist that she is not an actress. Her
co-stars, her producers, her director - even her acting coach - would
insist that she is.

Features | Animal rights activists say real fur is cruel but environment
campaigners argue that faux alternatives are unsustainable and harming
the environment. Olivia Petter reports

Fur has always been one of the most incendiary topics in the fashion
industry, but the debate has reached new heights in recent months as an
increasing number of labels implement bans on using animal skins in
their clothing.

In a bid to stay relevant to youngsters who order in regularly, this
ready-to-cook brand we're all familiar with, makes a case against food
delivery apps.

Food company, Mother's Recipe recently rolled out its new tagline 'Taste
the Love' which is in line with its original proposition of 'mother's
love imbibed in its brands'. Work on the new tagline was initiated
months ago with a digital ad campaign #TasteTheLove. The campaign
revolved around a couple of ads about Mother's Recipe's ready-to-cook
mix and pickles. But it is not that 'cut and try'; the brand rolled out
the ads with a purpose - to generate relevance among millennials and
their surroundings. And ordering food online is quite the *millennial*
thing.

A record number of women are vying to become MPs in Indonesia's
legislative election next month, but they continue to face an uphill
battle to make their voices heard.

A total of 3,194 female candidates are in the running for 575 seats in
the country's House of Representatives (DPR), making up 40 per cent of
nearly 8,000 legislative hopefuls - a historic high.

And, who does the *Millennial* blame for all of these problems? Baby
Boomers. The former Triple J breakfast host (pictured) chatted to
Confidential before arriving in Brisbane to perform his new show Enough
– about the frustrations of being a *Millennial* – at the Brisbane
Comedy Festival from March 19.

In the first few months of this year some 2000 people working for New
York-based digital media companies lost their jobs.

I was one of them. After 20 years in an industry permanently in flux,
I’m amazed it took my neck this long to connect with an axe. My five
years leading BuzzFeed in Australia were the most fun and fulfilling of
my professional life. Building something from scratch was an enormous
thrill and I’m proud of everything my team achieved: an audience of
millions, four Walkley nominations, eight Publish Awards — and
BuzzFeed’s first Cannes Golden Lion.

Bollywood’s old patriarchal order is crumbling. The spirited shards of
the glass ceiling reflect a bunch of brave young ­actresses leading the
revolution.

Welcome to the brave, new B-town where a brigade of young actresses are
smashing stereotypes and the old pat­riarchal order, setting the screen
on fire with an array of out-of-the-box roles that few of their
predecessors would have dared to pick in their heyday. Cool, confident
and in sync with the times, they are agents of transformation, pushing
the boundaries for women in Hindi cin­ema, and breathing life into the
mannequins of old, whose job was only to prettify the celluloid screen.

A thoroughly scientific dictatorship will never be overthrown — Aldous
Huxley

In contemporary China, it’s hard to know what people outside the party
dictatorship think about the future. As in the former Soviet Union,
often the best guide may be not in the controlled media or cowed
academia, but in the speculative wanderings of writers.

At first glance, it doesn't look like the congresswoman from New York's
14th District and I have much in common. She's from the Bronx, I'm from
Buxton. She's Latina, I'm white. She's really, really,
Instagram-model-potential pretty, and I'm - well, I know I have
cheekbones in here somewhere.

On the other hand - Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Victoria Hugo-Vidal
(that's me) have long, hyphenated, multisyllabic Spanish names. We're
both Instagram-scrolling, certified millennials. We're both high-energy
and have a lot of Big Ideas. And we both lost our dads to cancer at a
young age. AOC was 19; I was 25. She doesn't talk about him much in
interviews, but I find myself wondering what effect it had on her work
and her politics.

I spent the best part of an hour last week trying to understand
Splitit’s business model with its chairman Spiro Pappas, because the
thing has taken off like a rocket since listing on January 25 at 20c per
share. Now it’s $1.60 and capitalised at $277 million, an eight-week
eight-bagger, for goodness sake.

I got there in the end, but it wasn’t much helped by likening it to
Afterpay, the Australian buy now pay later operation with which it is
most often compared, now worth close to $5 billion — a fabled 10-bagger

Brian Chung remembers the first time he attempted to read the Bible.

A 20-year-old college student at the University of Southern California
at the time, he'd recently converted to Christianity and was eager to
plunge into the scripture that he'd heard so much about.

LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO: Two words for you - flying taxis. That's right. In
the not-so-distant future, you'll open your ride-hailing app. And next
to car, SUV and bicycle, you'll see this option - flying car. At least,
that's according to the optimists at the South by Southwest conference.
Here's NPR's Aarti Shahani.

AARTI SHAHANI: You might be the passenger who hails a taxi and heads to
the rooftop, where, at the helipad, your ride is waiting. It might look
like a minivan with wings and four seats or more like a gigantic drone.
Either way, it won't fly itself any time soon. One seat will be reserved
for the driver pilot.

Loose monetary policy has buoyed assets, but did not create meaningful
supply

Hyman Minsky would have had a field day with last week’s US inflation
numbers. One of the key points in the late, great economist’s Financial
Instability Hypothesis was that there are two kinds of prices — prices
for goods and services, and asset prices. Inflation in the two areas
should, as a result, differ. And indeed they have, quite markedly. The
latest Consumer Price Index figures show that almost all core inflation,
which was weaker than expected, was in rent or the owner’s equivalent of
rent (up 0.3 per cent). Core goods inflation, meanwhile, was down 0.2
per cent.

One of the most innovative ideas gathering interest among mental health
professionals is the use of virtual reality (VR) with clients
experiencing anxiety, PTSD and phobias through exposure therapy.

As a member of the *millennial* generation, VR-based therapies appear to
fit with the needs of young adults. As a University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign social work graduate student concentrating in advanced
clinical mental health, I am studying how to read body language, build
rapport and empathize with clients. From this perspective, VR appears to
diminish the human aspects of the client/therapist relationship.

to fancy universities so their mediocre kids could get a coveted spot?

At least he had enough scruples to write his $2.5 million check directly
to Harvard University. He didn’t try to pass off Jared as a water polo

On a sunny winter day in Denver — the kind that beckons you outside — my
sister, mother and I headed for a daylong adventure indoors. After
exploring picturesque mountain towns and quintessential Colorado
scenery, we explored a new trend that’s taking off in the Mile High
City: food halls. Seven food halls have popped up across Denver in
recent years and more are planned for 2019 as they become the epicenter
for all things local — from gift shops to restaurants and craft beer.
“Denver is so *millennial*, so hipster,” said my sister Megan, a
Minnesota native and Denver transplant, as we walked an alley marked
with Instagram-worthy quotes and art displays outside one market. From
Minneapolis to Manhattan, the urban food hall trend has exploded across
the country. A Cushman & Wakefield report estimates there will be 300
food halls nationwide by 2020, tripling the number in just five years.

Many of the widely denounced things Rep. Ilhan Omar has said since
taking Washington, D.C., by storm have had an element of truth in them.
It’s her occasional apologies that seem inauthentic. Meanwhile, two
other Minnesotans in the nation’s capitol, Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Rep.
Dean Phillips, have come in different ways to embody the mounting
frustrations of centrist Democrats faced with the insurgency of Omar and
fellow agitators in the growing “democratic socialist” wing of the
Democratic party. Minnesotans have grown accustomed over many decades to
seeing our politicians attract outsized national attention, for reasons
both inspiring and embarrassing — from Humphrey and McCarthy and Mondale
and Wellstone, to Michele Bachmann, Jesse Ventura and Al Franken. This
winter, Minnesota pols are becoming emblems of forces and factions
transforming American politics.

disappearance down a black hole is not due to tradition but lack of
investment and poor governance

Aday without sunshine is like, you know, night,' once chimed the
American comic Steve Martin. 'Outside of the two decades of the 1980s
and 90s, Offaly have only one Leinster Under- 21 title.They've achieved
zero in every other decade,' suggested Dónal g Cusack on last weekend's

What, no cortado? Millennials are flocking to the countryside, swapping
urban fads for a better quality of life.

No Deliveroo. No Uber. No artisan coffee shop. No phone signal, unless
you stick your arm out of the window. You can make your own cold-press
in the time it takes to download an email. It's a 10-minute drive to buy
a pint of milk and the nearest dry-cleaner, 12 miles away, shuts at 4pm.
It sounds like a *millennial* dystopia — yet more thirtysomethings than
ever are turning their backs on urban life and moving to the country.

Arrivals from Europe to the GCC will increase 29 percent between 2018
and 2023, driven by new and direct flight routes, a growing number of
*millennial* and middle-class travellers and competitive air fares,
according to new research.

Data released by Colliers International ahead of Arabian Travel Market
(ATM) 2019, which takes place in Dubai from April 28, as many as 8.3
million EU residents will travel to the GCC in 2023, an additional 1.9
million travellers.

Traditionally, ‘making money’ and ‘doing good’ have been seen as
mutually exclusive concepts by business leaders and the wider
population. Doing good, the thinking went, cut into corporate profits
and they alone dictated business decisions. This view, however, seems to
be changing as companies turn increasingly toward social or ‘impact’
investments to satisfy the demands of a younger and more socially
conscious population.

The term impact investment means investments that are made by companies
or individuals with the intention of generating a measurable and
beneficial social or environmental impact, alongside financial return.

People in Colorado still remember John Hickenlooper’s crack after the
state legalized marijuana, a move he opposed: “Don’t break out the
Cheetos or Goldfish too quickly.”

But Mr. Hickenlooper, the governor at the time of the 2012 initiative
allowing recreational use of cannabis, eventually changed his mind. He
acknowledged that fears of increased use by children did not
materialize, and he boasted of the tax revenues for social programs that
regulated sales delivered.

New Delhi, March 17 -- Being a *millennial* is hard work. In the era of
dizzying disruptions, we are expected to change the world and find
happiness while doing so. Since the mid-2000s, the interest in
happiness, as measured by Google searches, has trebled. While in the
early 1990s, there were a few hundred studies about happiness published
each year, by 2014, the number jumped to 10,000.

U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted: Jewish people are leaving the
Democratic Party."

Former Sen. Joe Lieberman, a Democrat turned Independent who ran for
vice president in 2000, said during a radio interview that the
Democratic Party is not anti-Jewish, but individual members have
problems with Jews.

After all, Funlab's entertainment brands, which include Strike Bowling,
Sky Zone and Holey Moley, all require participants coming together in
real life, not virtually.

If Thailand's pro-democracy parties had a "moon shot" - besides
overcoming severe handicaps to form government after the March 24
elections - it would be pushing through military reform when they come
to power.

The sheer audacity of such a plan was revealed last month. Upon hearing
the Pheu Thai Party's plan to cut the country's military budget by 10
per cent to fund job-creation initiatives, army chief Apirat Kongsompong
reacted with fury.

Sri Lanka, March 17 -- There really is no school like the old school,
proven by the wave of nostalgia that seems to be gripping modern
culture. In movies, fashion, music, design, even spirituality - shades
from yesteryear are making a comeback among the globalized generation,
with people looking for forgotten jewels in a bid to assert their
individuality. One such revived cultural artefact is the vinyl record,
which saw a sharp decline as technology brought newer music formats to
the forefront, but whose popularity is back on the rise around the world
and on our island.

The medium, which was once the staple format for music consumption, is
now seen as more of a premium item. Where artists once tried to fit all
their material onto a single LP inside a thin sleeve, records now often
come in fatter double- or even triple-disc packages, appealing more to
collectors and audiophiles rather than casual fans.

OTTAWA - With a federal election looming and Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau's government facing its worst political crisis in four years,
Canada's ruling Liberals are expected to table a goody-filled budget
later this week in bid to get back on course with voters.

Trudeau's Liberals surged to power in 2015 on a pledge to jolt the
economy by boosting spending, but their popularity has dropped sharply
in recent weeks amid claims that Canada's former Justice Minister was
pressured to help construction firm SNC-Lavalin avoid a criminal trial.

From office space to business centres, workplace environment is
undergoing a rapid transformation with GenX and millennials demanding
more creative collaborative space. This has led to emergence of
co-working or flexible office concept across major cities in the country.

Although the concept has seen maturity in the developed economies, of
late, India has emerged as one of the world’s most-preferred investment
markets, thanks to its thriving economy, burgeoning start-up ecosystem,
and ever-deepening talent pool. With businesses big and small continuing
to grow and broaden their horizons, expensive real estate coupled with
new-age professional’s desire to work in an aesthetically appealing
environment have spurred demand for collaborative workspaces in India.

Brian Chung still remembers the first time he attempted to read the Bible.

A 20-year-old college student at the University of Southern California
at the time, he'd recently converted to Christianity and was eager to
plunge into the scripture that he'd heard so much about.

On a sunny afternoon two years ago, as panic about the overheated
housing market in Canada's big cities was spreading, three key
policy-makers hunkered down in Toronto to figure out what to do.

Federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau, Toronto Mayor John Tory and
then-provincial finance minister Charles Sousa emerged with an
acknowledgement that the housing market was indeed in a precarious
state. They made a vow: they would try to take some action, but they
would certainly not do anything that would make matters worse.

Is your fear of technology hitting your career prospects? According to a
new survey, a third of us feel it could be. But the good news is, it's
never been easier to go from digital dinosaur to the next Steve Jobs
(well, almost). Leah Hardy finds out more

THE INTERNET, BORN IN 1990, is definitely a *millennial*: agile,
fast-moving and complex. I, however, grew up in the less nimble analogue
age - a time incomprehensible to my teenage children, when
Tipp-Ex-splattered typewriters dominated offices, phones were resolutely
immobile and battered copies of Encyclopedia Britannica were our Google.

"TRAVELLING for business or pleasure?" is increasingly becoming a
question of the past. This is at least the case with the much-courted
*millennial* travel demographic, who are driving the tendency of
combining leisure elements with work trips - a trend that has been aptly
coined "bleisure" travel.

With the influx of public holidays set for the upcoming months, many
working South Africans will be eager to take advantage of the time off
by planning a trip that incorporates some of these "free leave" days.

Rosewood opens its most luxurious new hotel today in Hong Kong's buzzing
Kowloon area. Duncan Craig is the first to check in and taste the high life

So, does it have a nickname yet?" I'm approaching the Rosewood Hong Kong
building, in Kowloon, from the Star Ferry Pier and the 65-storey
structure fills the cab's windscreen. The driver smiles. "Not yet," he
says. "But I'm sure they'll come up with something."

'Around the Gulf of Panama are the main urban conglomerates and
productive areas of our contemporary republic. However, few know the
age-old occupational history and use of this vast area. '

These words by the archaeologist Tomás Mendizabal, raise the importance
of the exhibition 'The Mediterranean Gulf of Panama: indigenous
connections in the Pacific Isthmus', which is presented at the Visitor
Center of Panama Viejo as the first activity of the program of temporary
exhibitions, one of the strategic lines of the Cultural Plan 500 years
old Panama Viejo.

IN many ways, it must be hard being Marta Kauffman. Sure, she's rich and
successful beyond her wildest dreams, having created Friends, the
defining sitcom of the 1990s. (And if you're a 46-year-old, who's about
to write an angry letter to the editor right now, I'm sorry but it's
just not Seinfeld okay? I don't make the rules.) Anyway Marta Kauffman
has spent the 15 years since Friends ended trying to explain that it
has, in fact, ended. It's over. We are not on a break. Marta has
continued to do new and exciting things, but all that anyone wants to
talk to her about is a hypothetical Friends reunion. It's like people
coming up to you constantly asking about an ex-boyfriend, "Do you ever
see him still? God, he was so great. Such a catch. Is he married now
or...?" Marta Kauffman must be exhausted.

Last week, in an interview with Rolling Stone, Marta tried to put the
issue to bed explaining very clearly, as if to a small and stupid child,
why Friends really wouldn't be returning.

Comment

Remember when Michael Douglas claimed in 2013 that his throat cancer was
caused by performing oral sex on his wife Catherine Zeta-Jones? In a now
infamous interview, the Basic Instinct star swiftly rejected any
suggestion that his disease could have been triggered by his party
lifestyle of smoking and drinking, saying: “Without wanting to get too
specific, this particular cancer is caused by HPV [human
papillomavirus], which actually comes about from cunnilingus.”
Zeta-Jones probably hasn’t forgotten.

Students and young professionals are escaping temperamental landlords

Tavarakere is something of a mecca for millenials working across
Bengaluru, who need a cheap place to live. The locality, in the south
east of the city, is a warren of narrow, congested roads, with apartment
buildings standing cheek by jowl with budget restaurants, grocery
stores, salons and realtors' offices.

This Holi, let fashion and fun go hand-in-hand as the best way to enjoy
a traditional festival is with a touch of style. To make the most of the
festival of colours, think of all the stylish trends that Bollywood
actors have been promoting on the silver screen for ages. From Deepika
Padukone's white shirt and denim shorts in the song ‘Balam Pichkari' to
Alia Bhatt's colourful skirts and playful tops for the title track of
Badri Ki Dulhania and 2 States - fashion can play a really important
role in adding a dash of glam for this fun festival. Not to forget,
dressing right for Holi can also save you from a lot of trouble after
you play colours because a smart fashionista knows the trick to look
good and play safe at the same time.

BENGALURU: Brick-and-mortar retailers such as Lifestyle International,
Shoppers Stop and Arvind Fashions are tweaking their merchandise mix or
using technology to attract younger consumers who shop online.“The
footfall of 18-22 year olds shrank by about 4% last year,” said Vasanth
Kumar, managing director of Lifestyle International, adding that tablets
to browse collections, a digital fitting-room assistant to alert the
staff for product sizes and smart self-checkout services have been
installed at key locations. “Making the time-starved and tech-savvy
segment come to the store is our focus this year. The tech initiatives
have been made keeping millennials in mind to reduce their pain
points.”India has a median population age of 27.3 years compared with 35
years for China and about 47 years for Japan and it is estimated that
the country has about 390 million millennials and about 440 million in
the Gen-Z cohort, according to a recent study by consulting firm Deloitte.

Gurgaon/New Delhi: Shivi Anand (15) wants you to save jamun, jackfruit
and mango seeds this summer. Wash, pack and keep them in your car, and
whenever you spot a patch of barren land while travelling, throw these
seeds and watch the future grow.“If every person here did this, we could
make Gurgaon green again, beautiful again, clean again,” said the young
environmentalist from Pathways School, addressing a group of students,
parents and fellow green activists.On Friday, over 600 students bunked
school to gather at Wazirabad bundh – location of a group of life-size
art installations created from waste – to take part in the Global School
Strike for Climate Change.

The financial advice industry needs to think carefully before rejecting
young people who don't fit traditional client profiles. This generation
needs guidance more than ever, says Iona Bain

Put yourself in the shoes of the average metropolitan *millennial*.
You're moving ahead in your career, getting closer to the day you'll
finally own your own home and perhaps considering whether to start a
pension or investment Isa.

How to survive your own fashion business?

Constant innovation is driving consumer demand in fashion. While the big
players in the fashion ecosystem are ceasing to exist without dramatic
improvisation from design to after-sales, there is a new start-up vibe
which is taking over businesses today. 'Start-up thinking' is
undoubtedly a key management model that more and more companies are
looking up to - in order to survive the competition with new energetic
start-ups taking away a substantial piece of the market.

The challenges Military service members experience transitioning to
civilian life.

Military service members face a variety of challenges transitioning back
into civilian life. They’re often tasked with finding a new job,
determining whether to pursue further education and deciding where to
live, all in a short period of time. Decisions around homebuying quickly
become one of their most pressing and significant. As many of these
veterans are first-time buyers, it’s worth considering some recent
trends regarding this important demographic.

Über-*millennial* Audrey Gelman is expecting her first baby, she has
revealed. A founder of women-only co-working space the Wing, Gelman
married Genius co-founder Ilan Zechory in 2016. The hipster wedding was
in Detroit and featured Gelman's childhood friend Lena Dunham - who
calls Gelman the inspiration for the character Marnie in her HBO hit
"Girls" - as a bridesmaid dressed in J.Crew. Gelman broke the news on
Instagram Friday with a photo of her growing belly, writing: "Excited to
meetus the fetus." She will be able to take her baby to work - the Wing
offers on-site day care.

India, March 16 -- Q. You have worked at Asian restaurants in biggest
hotel chains in India like ITC, Maurya and others. What inspired you to
bring Asian cuisines under one roof for them?

A. That was the need of the hour then. You have to keep yourself abreast
with the latest trends. Similar to the progressions in fashion and
lifestyle, cuisines also need to go through this kind of progression
over the years. It is an organic development. Bringing diverse flavours
under one roof was the main concept and giving your diners a choice of
flavours was the main idea.
