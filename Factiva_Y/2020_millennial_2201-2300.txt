The plant thief didn't need a shovel.

The variegated monstera was a fresh transplant inside the tropical
landscape house of Allan Gardens, and its heart-shaped leaves had
pleasing flecks of white and yellow.

Five years ago, Zak Normandin started selling a sleek, pricey,
low-calorie beverage called Dirty Lemon via text message. Now, Dirty
Lemon is growing up.

Since Normandin launched the drink in 2015 he's expanded the company,
rebranding it as Iris Nova and adding other beverages to its portfolio.
And soon, Dirty Lemon will make the ultimate jump into the mainstream:
It will be available at Walmart — something of a sea change for the company.

After extraordinary home value growth characterized a frenzied housing
market in 2017 and 2018, this year’s slowdown felt like a welcome return
to normalcy in much of the country. Zillow predicts more of the same in
2020, with the market stabilizing near historic norms.

Changing tastes as Millennials make up a growing share of home buyers
will impact the market. Homes will get smaller, bold colors and prints
will return to home designs and demand will stay high as more and more
people reach typical homebuying age.

The market of shops specialized in design products for daily life has a
new competitor in Mexico. The Dutchwoman Hema seeks to land in the
country with an aggressive plan of 200 stores by 2025 to offer Mexicans
the optimal sustainability and design component.

Grupo Ensueño y Modatelas will be the conglomerate that will bring the
Hema franchise to Mexico, whose first store will open in Mexico City in
the next summer, with a view to operating in Guadalajara and Monterrey,
confirmed John Lacker, CEO of the firm in the country; however, it did
not mention a specific amount of investment in that plan.

Ed Bahler, the founder of Summit SmartFarms, often talks about a quote
his father hung on the wall of his home office. It was from Thomas
Edison, and it said, "There is a way to do it better; find it."

This was ingrained in him from a young age, and Bahler is committed to
that to this day: the process of continuous improvement. That is what
Summit SmartFarms is all about, bringing tools to the agriculture
industry that can assist with continuous improvement of production — and
more importantly, the development of people.

Anne Helen Petersen knows you're tired.

In recent weeks, Petersen has been asking people about their feelings
toward leisure, work and burnout. And she was struck by how few of them
can find even a half-hour of free time — true leisure that isn't
compelled by someone or something, else.

The payment date for your work is approaching. But Monica Moreno knows
that, despite this, it is possible for her client to ask for an
extension. It wouldn't be the first time, nor the only customer who's
late on payments.In these cases, the publisher and event organizer draws
on their savings. In six years as a freelancer, he has learned that, in
order to not stop paying for routine services, he has to be very
organized and know how to 'play' well with the income he earns.

"When you start as a freelancer, you have limited growth. That's why
it's important to be clear about how much capital you have and what it's
enough for you. For the late payment times make the operation
complicated. One of the learnings I've had in this time is that you have
to choose your battles well, and your clients," he says.

His name is Henry and his surname *Millennial*. And it has both the
first and the second. You can see it in the most expensive stores and
you will recognize it quickly, but not by the classic image of luxury,
but quite the opposite.

Henry is not a man, he is the acronym that sums up the concept of High
Earners Not Rich Yet, that is, something like people with high
purchasing level who will become rich. To be a Henry in Spain you have
to be between 25 and 34 years old, earn between 70,000 and 180,000 euros
and know the concept of new luxury.

Two years after CKE Restaurants Holdings Inc. began separating its
marketing for Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s, a move meant to let each burger
chain speak better to its core customers and geographic footprint, the
company is reversing course.

CKE is launching a national ad campaign that reunites the Carl’s Jr. and
Hardee’s brands, now calculating that it can boost consumer awareness of
both brands better when they work together. The move comes amid fierce
competition in the restaurant business.

The 11 personal finance start-ups on this year’s Fintech 50 reflect both
the rise of the digital bank and the growing areas of consumer financial
behavior that fintechs are seeking to influence.

Two neobanks—MoneyLion and Dave—are on the list for the first time this
year, joining veteran Chime. Both newcomers are positioning themselves
as simpler, cheaper and more consumer friendly alternatives to
traditional banks and their gotcha fees. Dave promotes itself with a
cartoon bear and a “Banking for humans” tagline; instead of hitting
users with overdraft fees, it offers them cash advances of up to $100.

that the prison sentence that career prosecutors were seeking against
his old friend Roger Stone was too rough.

candidate Joe Biden, tumbling in the polls, answered a question from a
supporter at a campaign stop in New Hampshire.

by the double coverage of its nuclear weapons endowment and its still
control of the global financial system with its deadliest weapon: the
dollar.

I met the man who became my husband at a book party in a downtown loft
in late spring. In retrospect, meeting that way was auspicious, an
indication of a shared passion, if not for the particular book being
feted that evening — one about the dawning gig economy that has long
since been surpassed by bleaker fare — than for books in general. But at
the time, I wanted nothing to do with him.

“Hello, I’m Mark,” he said warmly, extending his hand with (I came to
learn) characteristic frankness. “Who are you?”

Just two months have passed since The Bloom Lounge threw open its
*millennial* pink doors to customers. But in that time, the cocktail
bar-cum-restaurant has caused quite the stir on social media. Across the
county, Instagram feeds have been flooded with pictures of the bar’s
pretty pink cocktails, plush interiors and photogenic food. Designed to
be Insta-friendly, everything about The Bloom Lounge seems engineered
for social media success. Snap away and watch the likes roll in – it’s a
*millennial* paradise!

So, after seeing photos circulating of the bar’s impressive brunch (each
dish coming complete with edible flowers, of course), I decided to get
myself down there to see if the food tasted as good as it looked.
Enlisting the help of two of my dearest friends – and seasoned Sunday
brunch veterans – I braved the elements and made my way through Storm
Ciara to The Bloom Lounge last weekend. It’s going to take more than
60mph winds to keep me from my breakfast.

When Somia Mourad first walked into the home that she would buy, she saw
dark-stained oak woodwork mixed with white woodwork on much of the main
level. In the kitchen, three different wood finishes fragmented the space.

"The house had clearly gone through a ton of renovations," Mourad said.

New Delhi, Feb. 12 -- Cashing in on holidays and festivals may not be
new for filmmakers in India but the industry is definitely looking
beyond the traditional pool of Diwali, Eid and Christmas. Valentine's
Day has emerged as the new release window that both Bollywood and the
south Indian industries want to grab, especially for youth-oriented
romantic films, with nearly four movies scheduled for release this
Friday, across languages.

The good news for democracy Tuesday was that in New Hampshire they know
how to count votes. That's especially good news for Bernie Sanders, who
was denied his election night TV time in Iowa last week but not this
time as he narrowly won the Granite State. Whether that's good news for
the Democratic Party is another story.

The socialist from next-door Vermont repeated his triumph from 2016,
albeit with a smaller (26%) share in a much larger field. The result
showed the loyalty of Mr. Sanders's *millennial* and left-wing
supporters despite a heart attack and his 78 years. In poll after poll,
in state after state, Mr. Sanders has retained that plurality base of
more than 20%.

NEW YORK " When campaigning for Mike Bloomberg, Diana Taylor is usually
introduced as simply: Diana Taylor. This is a testament to her personal
stature, her formidable résumé and her independence. It's also a
reflection of a peculiar cultural conundrum.

'I'm a unicorn in a unicorn campaign,' Taylor says.

Everyone will soon be using flip phones again, the head of Samsung's UK
division proclaimed as the company released its latest range of smart
devices (Tom Knowles writes).

Ten years after flip phones went out of fashion, Samsung has released
the Galaxy Z Flip, a phone with a glass screen that folds into a
clam-shell shape and which the company hopes will bring some excitement
back into the market.

Several opposition senators considered that the proposal made by Andrés
Manuel López Obrador on the elimination of holiday bridges would damage
the tourist activity of the country. That's why they made a
counterproposal to the Federal Government, so they asked to create new
holiday bridges.

"The degree of unprofessionalism of this government is really
regrettable. No, it is absurd, a distraction, unfortunately, of the
important issues: the stagnant economy, health collapsed and the country
caught up in violence," said Damian Zepeda, senator for the National
Action Party (PAN).

From refusing to date two-faced Geminis to blaming all their problems on
'mercury retrograde' - zodiac signs have become an essential part of the
*millennial* lifestyle and vocabulary. That's because astrology is back
in style in 2020, and is now being touted to be a big part of a $2.2
billion industry, known as the "mystical services market."From Silicon
Valley to India, tons of moolah is being pumped into astrology apps,
even as tarot readers and astrologists report an unprecedented rise in
customers. Here's a closer look at the trend...

KUALA LUMPUR: A rich *millennial* of Malaysian multi-family private
investment firm RHL Ventures has become one of the youngest persons to
join the board of a company listed on a major United States stock
exchange. Rachel Lau, co-founder and managing partner of RHL Ventures,
joined the board of directors of GNC Holdings Inc, the US-based leading
global health and wellness brand listed on the New York Stock Exchange
effective Jan 22. Lau reportedly is the daughter of the late Lau Boon
Ann, who built his real estate empire by investing in companies such as
Top Glove Corp Bhd. Besides Lau, the partners behind RHL Ventures are
the offspring of some of the country's “who’s who” in the corporate
scene. Raja Hamzah Abidin is the son of former federal territories and
urban well-being minister and Rasma Corp founder Datuk Seri Raja Nong
Chik Raja Zainal Abidin while Jo Jo Kong Chin Joe’s father is Tan Sri
Kong Hon Kong, who founded the Hong Kong-listed Nirvana Asia Ltd.

TVS Srichakra Ltd, one of India’s leading manufacturers of two- and
three-wheeler tyres, was started in 1982. The company is based in
Madurai, Tamil Nadu, and is part of the $8.5-billion TVS Group, a
respected name in the Indian auto components industry. The company rolls
out around 2.8 million tyres every month from its two manufacturing
facilities—one in Madurai and the other in Rudrapur (Uttarakhand). In
addition, it exports to 70-odd countries.

In August last year, the company announced the launch of the brand TVS
Eurogrip. Under the Eurogrip umbrella, a portfolio of 19 premium tyres
that include zero-degree steel-belted radial tyres has been introduced.

THERE was a scramble for non-bank players to speed-date the traditional
lenders in Singapore, but thus far, none has made it to the altar with
the final digital-bank consortia.

There is a simple explanation. The incumbents are entrenched, with the
local trio holding a market share of more than 50 per cent here, and
rules here have for years allowed them to set up digital entities
separately.

The dairy major goes for a brand refresh with new packaging and sharper
digital tools, looks to set itself apart from clutter in the dairy market

Mother Dairy is rewriting the brand rulebooks to talk to an audience
that is younger, premium-paying and more diverse than its traditional
stronghold of milk-guzzling North Indian states. The brand is
positioning itself for a national audience and looking to wear the
mantle of a *millennial* dairy label (despite its legacy of 45-odd
years) by infusing quirky humour and agility into its digital persona,
thereby differentiating itself from rivals Amul (Gujarat Cooperative
Milk Marketing Federation) and Nestle among others.

TRENDS What’s next for fashion, beauty and style in the new ‘Roaring
Twenties’?

1. The 20s throwback “I think we should roar more,” Paris-based
Australian creative director and stylist Catherine Baba proclaims. Given
that we’re in the 20s once again, and judging by the countless
1920s-themed New Year’s Eve parties documented on Instagram recently,
she may get her wish. “The (1920s) was a shaking-up decade … (it) was so
diverse and liberating,” Baba says, drawing parallels between the
transitional creative climates then and now. She describes the
prototypical flapper look as “so rich” but guesses that the 1920s’
freewheeling spirit will influence designers more conceptually than
literally.

When Kyle Paranuik's parents were in their mid-20s, they bought their
first house in small-town Ontario for $45,000.

Thirty-five years later, Paranuik bought his own first home in downtown
Toronto - but it was a lot smaller (540 square feet), it cost a lot more
($691,500) and at age 31, he was quite a lot older.

DAVID GREENE: Top Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and
Elizabeth Warren both call for a ban on fracking. This is the
controversial technology that has helped create a major oil and gas
boom, which President Trump often brags about on the campaign trail. As
voters in New Hampshire head to the polls today, NPR's Jeff Brady took a
look at the debate over this divisive issue.

JEFF BRADY: Here's a message Bernie Sanders was delivering even back
during the 2016 campaign.

Durham, New Hampshire | The presidential election is still nine months
away but Wall Street and its Australian equivalents can no longer afford
to be complacent about Bernie Sanders.

The independent Senator and long-standing "democratic socialist" is
poised to win the opening New Hampshire primary on Tuesday (Wednesday
AEDT), adding to his strong Iowa showing last week.

When Kyle Paranuik's parents were in their mid-20s, they bought their
first house in small-town Ontario for $45,000.

Thirty-five years later, Paranuik bought his own first home in downtown
Toronto - but it was a lot smaller (540 square feet), it cost a lot more
($691,500) and at age 31, he was quite a lot older.

For several years, Robinhood Financial LLC had an ace in the hole with
its commission-free trading app, rapidly accumulating users and
attracting rich valuations from investors. But now that the incumbents
have eliminated commissions, the Silicon Valley startup will have to
come up with a new competitive advantage. Robinhood faces increased
competition not only from the traditional online brokers, but from a
number of large banks and other fintech startups.

Robinhood grew swiftly, going from zero users to more than 10 million in
less than six years. The second half of 2018 was a particularly strong
period for growth. The company reported "over four million" users on May
10, 2018, and only five months later it disclosed having "over six million."

Two scenarios always come to mind anytime I talk about options available
to legal professionals and litigants in dispute settlements other than
litigation. In the first scenario, a party is being owed N380,000 (three
hundred and eighty thousand naira) by a company he rendered services to,
he decides to take the company to a magistrate court to recover the said
sum. As trial commences, he opens his case, calls his witnesses, and the
defendants also open their defence, and say that indeed the claimant is
being owed the monies, but by a different management of which the
claimant is fully aware of the internal working arrangement.

Diversity is a complex area that needs brands to go beyond the
superficial and dive deep. By Ravi Amaratunga Hitchcock, co-founder, Soursop

"We need a person of colour, a female, an LBGTQI person, preferably
trans. A mentally and physically disabled person and maybe an older
person to round it all off. Be great if we could encompass all of this
into one influencer."

The math just didn’t work out.

“MATH” was, of course, the slogan of Andrew Yang’s campaign, but it was
also his undoing. In the end, the Democratic candidate concluded he
wasn’t viable, and so as numbers rolled in from the New Hampshire
primary, he announced he is suspending his
campaign[https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/02/andrew-yang-drops-out/606352/?utm_source=feed].

Reportedly, the front-facing cellphone camera was originally intended to
be a way for business colleagues to teleconference one
another[https://qz.com/1104742/front-facing-cameras-were-never-intended-for-selfies/]
while they were working in separate locations. Introduced in Japan in
1999[https://www.computerworld.com/article/2473084/camera-phones--a-look-back-and-forward.html]
and the United States four years later, it was not initially a widely
heralded innovation. And its inventors probably did not anticipate that
it would inspire a new genre of photography—the selfie—or become a
beloved plaything for toddlers all over the globe.

In parts of Edinburgh, unemployment was as high as 25 per cent or more
in the 1980s, but booming numbers of tourists have brought jobs and
helped reduce poverty, writes Donald Anderson.

A recent News article on Edinburgh's City Plan caught my attention.
Councillor Neil Gardiner, Edinburgh's planning convenor, was quoted and
had chosen to focus on Wester Hailes in the area he represents. He said
unequivocally that the City Plan he was launching would only be
successful if it made a difference for the people in Wester Hailes,
where there were high levels of poverty. For people who are at times
cynical about politicians, it was a timely reminder that most
politicians in all political parties really do want to make a
­difference and are genuinely trying to take the right decisions for the
people they represent.

A snapshot of the Buffalo residential real estate market in the new

That means higher prices, lower sales and declining inventory amid
continued low interest rates. In other words, very much like 2019.

As banking undergoes transformational change across the globe, the ATM
industry must adjust to stay relevant. Incumbent banks — facing
competition from neobank competitors in the U.S. and abroad to Silicon
Valley powerhouses like Google, Facebook and Apple  — are completely
rethinking the way they interact with customers and changing the role of
the traditional branch and the ATM.  

These factors are forcing the ATM industry to change the way it
interacts with the banks, merchants and consumers. And experts are
discussing just that this week at the ATMIA U.S. conference in Houston.
