Pete Buttigieg can tell that things have changed.

Buoyed by positive reviews for the South Bend mayor's performance at an
hour-long CNN town hall earlier this
month[https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/11/politics/buttigieg-fundraising-townhall/index.html]
and a steady stream of well received appearances on TV, Buttigieg's 2020
presidential exploratory committee has felt a sustained surge of
momentum over the past two weeks. The once little-known mayor is getting
recognized across the country, while his committee has mapped out plans
to double in size in the coming weeks as a steady stream of new
donations flood to the 37-year-old Democrat.

New Delhi, March 24 -- Avocado toast is getting some serious competition
on *millennial* Instagram feeds-and it's not a hipster food fad. It is
something any Italian nonna (grandmother) would approve of: fat ringlets
of hand-cut pasta glistening in cheese with a sprinkling of coarsely
ground pepper-simple, hearty and messy food. Hashtags like
#girlswithgluten are slowly beginning to do the rounds, bringing pasta
and pizza back to food conversations.

The trend seems to be taking shape in Mumbai too. Last year saw the
opening of a clutch of fine-dining Italian restaurants that are taking
the focus back to home-style regional Italian food.

Philadelphia has long been one of my favorite cities. Having grown up in
New Jersey and gone to college at Rutgers, I’ve been visiting, and
tracking, the city since the mid-1970s. I saw it in perhaps its most
hard-pressed days and cheered on the stunning revival of its downtown
area over the past decade or so. I’ve been visiting even more now, as
the inaugural Philadelphia Fellow sponsored by Drexel University, Thomas
Jefferson University, and the University City Science Center, where I
have been working with local stakeholders and academics to benchmark
where the city stands on key metrics and to develop strategies for the
future.

We are nearly 20 years into the 21st century and businesses are no
closer to having the 21st-century workforce. While generations of
students have come of age in an era of upskilling, rapid technological
and AI growth, employers, like us, remain frustrated that far too few
job applicants have the skills we need for our companies to succeed.
Workforce development initiatives that focus on retraining adults who
are unemployed or underemployed may address a small part of the problem,
but that’s only a remedial solution. The commonsense way to ensure that
all businesses have a better skilled labor pool is to make sure that
students graduate from high school and enter the workforce prepared for
today’s careers.

Ecuador is experiencing a new electoral process today, this time to
choose those who will be in charge of local governments and the
Participation Council.

An analysis of DATA COMMERCE allows us to show that these elections are
not only different from others because of the number of candidates
participating, but also because of the current population density in
five cantons and the high incidence of the millenials.

Investors have been so focused on how the Fed’s dovish stance on
interest rates led to a rebound in stock prices that they haven’t yet
digested how much this development could stimulate the housing market,
particularly in the back half of the year. Friday’s strong numbers on
existing home sales — up nearly 12 percent last month compared to
January — might get their attention.

A Twitter meme gives me hope . . . not that you asked

From time to time in this space, I like to put on my lab coat (very
slimming), take a pipette, suck up a tiny little sample of the
Internet's bustling semiotic biome, and squeeze it under some glass for
inspection. There's a whole world going on in every drop. It's really
something.

The Incredible String Band

Central characters in Electric Eden, Rob Young’s epic history of British
folk music, the Incredible String Band were hippy princelings Clive
Palmer, Robin Williamson and Mike Heron who were at the forefront of
psychedelia. Their music was a trippy, roiling reinvention of what folk
music could do. Paul McCartney was a big fan. They cut their teeth in
Edinburgh folk clubs before retreating to live a communal existence in
cottages in Balmore, where they practised archery among other things.

For this week's column we cross live to the fashion desk with MELISSA
SINGER and MARY WARD.

Mary Ward (Deputy Lifestyle Editor): Chanel closed its recent Paris
Fashion Week show with an onslaught of classic black and white
winterwear: tailored coats, chunky knits and scarves, lots of scarves -
a Collingwood scarf is being touted as this winter's must-have
accessory. It's a terrifying prospect but it got me thinking: which AFL
team starts this season with the most on-trend strip?

Somehow, about a year ago, I found myself backstage at Jazz at Lincoln
Center. Rachel Bloom, the star and my co-creator of ''Crazy
Ex-Girlfriend,'' was about to perform some songs from our show in
Lincoln Center's prestigious American Songbook series, and she had
invited me to do a number with her called ''JAP Battle.'' Me, 50 years
old, onstage, rapping. Everyone else who was about to be onstage (Rachel
and Jack Dolgen and Adam Schlesinger, the ''Crazy Ex'' songwriting team)
was a seasoned songwriter and performer. Me? I was about to perform in
public for the first time since my high school graduation in 1985, when
I sang, very out of tune, the Kenny Rogers classic ''Through the Years''
with my friend John.

First impressions at The Dixon, a former magistrate's court, are
powerful - but smaller details are criminal

I was having coffee with Stephen Alesch of the New York architectural
interiors powerhouse Roman and Williams the other day and he was telling
me about his work on the forthcoming NoMad hotel in London, repurposing
the old Bow Street Magistrates' Court in Covent Garden. "Oh, I spent a
night in there a long time ago," I told him. He laughed. "I thought you
might have done, you look the sort," he said, with an arched eyebrow.
"Well, it was the Nineties," I replied.

SA needs to explore more democratic and inclusionary alternatives to
authoritarianism and corrupt ruling

At the end of the Cold War in 1989, it was widely, although not
uniformly, assumed that liberal democracy, with a capitalist economy,
was the only viable way forward. This consensus shaped the transition
from apartheid in profound ways.

He made his name photographing fashion's elite on the streets of Milan
and Paris. Now Tommy Ton is intent on dressing them, too. Jane McFarland
meets him in New York

The paradigm of what makes a successful fashion designer is in flux.
Honed practical technique is certainly useful, but shifting product in
today's saturated market requires a real understanding of what women
need. Perennial people-watcher Tommy Ton may have the answer. Born in
Canada, and now based in New York, the 35-year-old has spent more than a
decade shooting stylish show-goers for fashion magazines and websites,
and, as streetstyle photography has become an integral part of
fashion-week coverage (nowadays there can be anything up to 250 snappers
outside the shows), so too has Ton.

Actor, voice of Paddington, Q in Bond

Ben Whishaw, the voice of Paddington, the *millennial* Q in the Bond
films, the next generation of Mr Banks in Disney's epic Mary Poppins
reboot, is fresh off the plane from LA. He is wearing a navy shirt, dark
wool trousers and a fluffy knitted hat over his lush curls. It's a
strange combination of quirkiness and elegance. At the start of the year
he won a Golden Globe and a Critics' Choice award for his captivating
portrayal of Norman Scott opposite Hugh Grant's Jeremy Thorpe in A Very
English Scandal. Of course he says he didn't expect to win, and of
course he says it feels great, but when I ask if this recognition from
Hollywood means he'll spend more time out there, he says: "No idea. I
don't feel it's my world. I just sort of dropped in and it was a lovely
thing. I would like to drop in more often. Maybe it opens doors. I guess
we'll see."

AFTER years of joking about it, it's finally come to pass: according to
new statistics, more pensioners are using Facebook compared to people
under the age of 18.

It's true, pensioners love Facebook. They love leaving comments on their
grandniece's new profile picture saying, "Lovely photograph i am looking
at it on my ipad right now!!" They love sharing ancient cartoons
involving weird sexist boob jokes. They love bloodymindedly believing
that everything they see on their timeline has been sent to them personally.

Chicken wings were what made Elephant & Castle in Temple Bar a go-to
destination in 1989. Taken over by the Press Up Group a couple of years
back, it has now opened on the strip in Monkstown, with *millennial*
mummies piling in with the sprogs. Mind you, I'd expect a big bucket of
wings at €14.95. See elephantandcastle.ie

COLUMBIA, S.C. — Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg told
voters Saturday that his marriage to his husband exists "by the grace of
a single vote on the U.S. Supreme Court."

The South Bend, Indiana, mayor visited South Carolina for the first time
since announcing his presidential exploratory committee. The 37-year-old
would be the first openly gay presidential nominee from a major
political party.

Like any other generation, millennials are into makeup and skincare. The
only difference is that millennials extend their life’s skintellectual
philosophy into cosmetic looks as well. Their conscience-based,
awareness-driven lifestyle reflects in their beauty choices. More
simplicity and less exotica seem to have renewed its life cycle. Back in
69 BC, it was said Cleopatra owed her beauty to a potion of donkey’s
milk, honey, Dead Sea salt and almond oil. Unlike in contemporary
cities—especially in India and the developing world, where a skincare
expert recommends oxygenating masks, bionic oxygen facials and facial
flash oxygen masks—she was at an advantage, with the world’s cup
brimming over with pure air, clear water, virgin soil and verdant
forests that threw up enough oxygen. Today, with depleting sustainable
reserves, the skincare industry is combating modern-day perils such as
pollution, extreme weather, and overexposure to synthetic and packaged
substances.

A coup leader emerges as a civilian prime minister, pro-democracy forces
unite to thwart the junta's ambitions, a stalemate or another putsch
resets the political landscape -- Thailand's cliffhanger of an election
Sunday could result in a number of outcomes.

Here are some of the possible scenarios after the first vote in eight years.

Shillpi Singh examines the fast soaring trend that's sweeping men and
booming businesses

Does one cream fit all? Not any more. Delhi-based advocate Anshul
Narayan, 33, maintains, "Not just women, but we, the men, are equally
conscious of our looks. After all, it pays to look presentable, and
well-groomed. And unlike the common perception that men aren't bothered
enough to pay attention to their skin, beard, hair, we do care, and a
lot more than ever." True that!

Kshipra Ajrekar probes why India's millennials want meaningful purpose

Millennials, typecast for popularising the 'selfie' and transforming the
meaning of the word 'viral', are bringing about a historic shift in the
reason behind choosing one's career: seeking a meaningful purpose.

Five hundred years ago, in the 16th century, two legendary singers
Tansen and Baiju Bawra sang at a recital in Agra. When Tansen began to
sing raga todi, a herd of deer came rushing into the audience only to
create visual imagery for every raga. Since then, it is said that the
raga is performed right if that connects to these creatures. A similar
moment was created in Varanasi in 1996 when musical maestro Pandit
Jasraj witnessed a deer run past the audience and stopped next to the
stage where he was performing the same raga todi. Although centuries
apart, these similar incidents signalled a belief in Hindustani
classical music.

They may be the powerhouses of the fashion industry, but many of our top
designers started out under far less glamorous circumstances and went on
to carve a niche for themselves. While some started out from a small
room in their house, others showcased their first collection in an
intimate gathering. Read on...

Namrata.Singh@timesgroup.comMumbai: Indian subsidiaries of multinational
companies are usually viewed through the lens of their size in
comparison to the parent. What’s striking about Siemens, which has been
operating in India since 1867 when the first telegraph line was laid
between Calcutta and London by the German conglomerate, is that it has
the youngest workforce in India.The average age at the 23,000-strong
Siemens in India — which is into energy-efficient technologies, combined
cycle turbines for power generation and power transmission solutions —
is 28 years. It is much younger than Germany (47 years), where Siemens
is headquartered, or the US (37 years). A young workforce could reflect
a vibrant culture. However, it can also be a challenge.In an exclusive
interview with TOI, Siemens CHRO Janina Kugel talked about a unique
challenge the organisation is facing globally. “From the global
perspective, we are facing a bit of a challenge.

By Sandeep DuttaOnce upon a time, when the world was gentler and more
graceful, brands were supposed to present a vision of life that is
sweet, wholesome and almost perfect. Everyone at that time believed that
people only want to experience positive emotions and pretend that there
was no dark side to life. Today people are conscious of the fact that
the world is far from perfect and are willing to embrace the realities
even if they are ugly, undesirable and unacceptable. The millennials and
Gen Y's are less-easily shocked, outspoken and are increasingly getting
comfortable with a culture that is daring and see through. Recently, as
consumer researcher I was involved in a study whose purpose was to get
under the skin of the *millennial* and understand all aspects of their
lives, the good, the bad and the dark. ‘Confession booths’ were created
to encourage participants to share their dark emotions especially those
that led to buying and consuming.

But there are doubts the sixth election in two decades will put an end
to the country's political strife amid a high hurdle for the return of
civilian rule

From Thailand's northern Shan Hills to its southern floodplains,
last-minute vote canvassing in the kingdom ceased at 6pm yesterday as
its 69 million people readied themselves for a general election analysts
believe will be nothing short of a political roller-coaster ride.

Camel milk is fashionable in highend restaurants. But could it also be
the future for dairy farming in the world's drought-afflicted regions?
Madison Darbyshire reports. Illustration by Tim Lahan

W hen the FT mail room informed me that two bottles of ice-cold camel
milk had arrived, my heart dropped. I had spent weeks researching and
championing camel milk's status as the "future of dairy" to my
colleagues; now I had to taste it. As I went to try the surprisingly
thick beverage, my nose wrinkled, my lips pursed. I realised that
something I had not expected was holding me back: prejudice.

I'm considering spending £5,000 on new bookshelves — beautifully crafted
but expensive. Is it worth the money or is it wasteful given that they
will soon be covered up by my books? Are they a good investment or

Thanks for an enjoyable read ("Interview: Tim Martin", March 16/17). I
warmed to the man - though not so much that I'm going to give him any of
my custom. But the passion with which he holds his views exemplifies the
real problem the country is up against. David Cameron called the
referendum as a way of holding his party together. Instead, he has
divided not only his party but the entire country. Harry Parkes via
FT.com Re "How India conquered YouTube" (March 16/17): if you look at
numbers and income, the internet ought to be ruled by China but its
paranoid government clamps down on it. It would be so deserving if this
hands leadership over to India, a country that has trailed China in
economic terms and that has often been frustrating to those of us who
believe (imperfect) democracy is better than one-party rule. Go India.
JohnDoe via FT.com @lizziepaton 500m internet users. Booming
*millennial* middle-class population. India is fast becoming a powerful
consumer of video content.

(Side note: most western brands, esp fashion and luxury, are still
unable to get a foothold there) The mainstream politician can always
keep the populists at bay by doing a good job for his electorate (Simon
Kuper, March 16/17).

After this year's particularly brutal instalment of the annual Ezra
Avenue St. Patrick's Day insanity in Waterloo, local authorities have
two choices.

They can stay the course, wait until someone is critically injured or,
heaven forbid, killed at one of these illegal, uncontrolled student
street parties and then, with heads bowed, do exactly what the ensuing
public inquiry tells them to do.

The Jewish festival of Purim, celebrated this week, is a time for kids
to don costumes, enjoy a slice of Jewish history and share traditional
foods with their families. Such intergenerational gatherings are coveted
by faith leaders, many grappling with a growing trend — age segregation
in their houses of worship. “We have six generations of people alive
today, and we don’t have a playbook for them to meet and be part of one
another’s lives,” said Hayim Herring, a St. Louis Park rabbi, consultant
and author of the forthcoming book “Connecting Generations.” “We’re
probably living in one of the most age-segregated societies,” he said.
“How do we make it [blending generations] normative again?” While the
trend of age segregation is occurring across society — from housing to
the workplace — religious institutions are in a unique position to blend
generations, he said. “I can’t think of another institution with access
to multiple generations over a long period of time,” Herring said.

The big read: The cameras love her and her social-media skills match
Donald Trump's but centrists worry that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is
pushing Democrats too far to the left. Niall Stanage reports declared
his candidacy at the time of writing, though he is expected to do so
soon.) Sanders had been a fringe figure in American politics until he
stunned the establishment in 2016 by mounting a competitive challenge to
Hillary Clinton for the Democratic Presidential Nomination.

These days, Sanders' biggest problem is very different. His ideas have
become so popular that he is no longer their only high-profile advocate.

In 2018, the U.S. economy benefited from historically low employment,
brisk spending, an aggressive tax stimulus and hordes of game-changing
advancements in technology. This singular combination of tailwinds
yielded a growth rate of 2.9%.

That's not terrible, especially compared with many wheezing economies
abroad, but it's not even in the ballpark of historic highs.

If Gladys Berejiklian’s government is returned by NSW voters today much
of the credit will go to a group of South Park-loving young Liberal
staffers and the WhatsApp group they created to organise a house party.

Margin Call has pieced together the inside story of the now-infamous
video of NSW Labor leader Michael Daley — the one warning of “our young
children” losing their jobs to “young people, from typically Asia” —
which this week up-ended the state election campaign.

Editor's note: Julián Melo is CEO and Co-Founder of UBits. The opinions
expressed in this column belong exclusively to the author. (Expansion) -
Human Resources managers are questioning, and increasingly frequently,
how to train new generations, punctually the millennials. Recently I was
surprised to hear a Director of training and development of a major
company in the financial sector, concerned about the low effectiveness
and participation of the training and development plans she was
executing. Their concern revolved around the new generations, and their
difficulty to achieve good results in the training processes among this
audience. His statement closed with the phrase: "In conclusion, training
and developing millennials is almost impossible, they are overwhelmed,
they are distracted and impatient." His affirmation is associated to one
of the axes of greater work that the leaders of training have. For me,
the reflection revolves around how to train the future workforce?

India, March 23 -- Just a day after my one-hour long conversation with
filmmaker Vishal Bhardwaj at the Brahmaputra Valley Film Festival in
Guwahati, one statement went viral.

"I'd have replaced the leading man in Haider," Bhardwaj had told me,
referring to Shahid Kapoor in his much-acclaimed adaptation of Hamlet.
"But I would never have been able to make the film without Tabu!"

KUALA LUMPUR, March 23 — Danny is a fashion enthusiast with a passion
for “slow-wear”[https://goodonyou.eco/what-is-slow-fashion/]brands, a
clothing philosophy built on the old school ethos that the shirts or
pants you wear should last a lifetime.

Because most of these brands are not available here, Danny, a
*millennial* who just wanted to go by his first name, said he has to
order them from countries like the United Kingdom or Japan.

While lifelong learning is now essential, it’s easy to spend time and

The key to selecting and spending well is to figure out how to choose

Thailand's king issued a rare statement late Saturday hours before the
junta-run country's first election in nearly five years, quoting his
late father's advice to support "good" leaders to prevent "chaos".

King Maha Vajiralongkorn's last-minute intervention comes less than two
months after a royal command torpedoed the candidacy of his elder sister
Princess Ubolratana for prime minister of a party linked to billionaire
ex-premier Thaksin Shinawatra.

From ‘Antigone’ to ‘Blasted’, ‘Hamlet’ to ‘Jerusalem’, Paul Taylor and
Holly Williams choose 40 brilliant plays to watch, hear or read

Theatre is the quintessential art of reinterpretation. Every time a play
is revived it is “remade”. With something so joyously provisional, why
would you want to be definitive? And so with that in mind, let’s be
clear that what follows is not some Olympian effort to decree “the best
plays of all time”. Instead, it is a selection of pieces we find
continually rewarding.

Non-Electric Kitchen Appliances Market By Distribution Channel, By
Product Type, Competition, Forecast and Opportunities, 2014-2024, which

lifestyles, increasing per capita disposable incomes, the increasing
preference for branded products, the rising demand for kitchen
appliances in rural areas, the rising number of nuclear families in
urban areas, the changing kitchen concepts, the expanding middle class
population and the growing youth population, who are inclined towards
products offering enhanced convenience.

to greater empowerment, financial independence, and a desire to set her
own goals and improve the quality of her life.

Spoiler alert: This review discusses plot points in the final season of
Amazon Prime’s “Catastrophe.”

We’ve come to the end of Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney’s exceptional
British dramedy “Catastrophe,” the show I keep telling people to watch
when they complain about having nothing good left to watch.

The Muskrat Falls hydroelectric project, announced to great fanfare in
2010, was supposed signal the start of the province's economic
independence. Now, it has become an economic albatross that, combined
with the decline in oil prices, threatens to push the province's
debt-to-GDP ratio to 200 per cent by 2040

When you go looking for evidence that Newfoundland and Labrador's
economic dream is alive, you won't find it in the tourism bureau images
of sleepy fishing villages and freshly laundered sheets waving on a line
in impossibly green fields. It's not in Bull Arm, the offshore oil
platform construction site that has sat largely empty for most of the
past year and a half. You'll find it in 2,400 acres of rock, trees and
nascent suburban ambition on the southwestern fringe of St. John's,
known as Galway.

Pearl Cleage understands how Southerners use honorifics to show respect
for elders.

She knows that "ma'am," drawled a certain way, shows deference, and
that, these days, when younger black people say "Auntie" before uttering
an elder black woman's first name, it's a form of veneration.

WHEN I was a teenager the most withering put-down that could be applied
by those terrifying cool girls with crimped mullets and electric-blue
eyeliner was: "Oh grow up!" It was a confusing command. We'd only been
on the planet for 14 years.

Even if some of us had made the trajectory from Sindy dolls to Simon Le
Bon a little more slowly than others, how much more mature could we be
at this tender age? It was particularly baffling to me as I was never
sure what age to act at 14.

On International Women's Day, two men meet to talk about books that
shaped a life. Following a bad premonition, I reserved a "quiet spot" in
the "Café Savigny" the evening before the new Berlin public holiday. The
Charlottenburg institution is packed when Florian Illies comes through
the glass door at noon and heads straight for director Detlev Buck to
greet him briefly. That Illies, the new Rowohlt publisher, has had to
deal with supposedly profane decisions since January, he demonstrates on
his smartphone. The display shows various cover suggestions for the
volumes from the Rowohlt series "Die Ärztin ". A kind of reading that
has so far been rather alien to the aesthete, this cleverly entertaining
bestselling author ("Generation Golf" or "1913 "), the former head of
the legendary "Berliner Seiten" of the "FAZ ", the founder of the art
magazine "Monopol", the "Zeit" columnist and later shareholder of the
auction house Grisebach.

Annabelle Williamson the shambles of the leasehold system

"I bought a home because I wanted to be free of the rental trap, and now
I'm trapped by a leasehold." These were the words of a mid-thirties
friend who finally got on the housing ladder last year, only to promptly
fall into a dispute with her freeholder.

weekend essay Traditional Radio 4 listeners are being ignored in the
rush towards a future of apps and dumbed-down programmes, argues Matthew
Moore

In 1924 the founding director-general of the BBC, Lord Reith, warned
against underestimating audiences' appetite for quality. "He who prides
himself on giving what he thinks the public wants is often creating a
fictitious demand for low standards which he will then satisfy," he wrote.

Mumbai, March 23 -- Do you like big houses or prefer a smaller one?
Whether you like it or not, builders are opting for smaller apartments,
considering the rise in demand for affordable houses at good location.
The top seven cities collectively saw the average apartment sizes shrink
by nearly 17% between 2014 and 2018, as per a data by property
consultant Anarock.

Always dreamt of buying your first home, but don't know where to start?
Follow these step-by-step financial masterstrokes and inch closer to
your goal each day

Nowhere is the stark difference between aspiration and achievement among
Indian millennials more visible than in the country's real estate
market. According to the Aspiration Index survey conducted by a leading
financial portal across 12 metro and non-metro cities in July 2018,
nearly 69 per cent millennials (in the age bracket of 25 to 35 years)
consider home ownership as their biggest aspiration, but only 57 per
cent actually own (includes inherited homes) or expressed financial
capability to buy one. Hence, it is no surprise that affordable housing
finds increased focus from the government and real estate developers,
who see millennials as a prime potential customer base.

DANCE of DEMOCRACYPolitical parties have discovered the virtues of
campaigning via Instagram ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Memes,
short explainer videos, cartoons and parody songs - the ruling BJP and
opposition Congress are pulling no punches on the photosharing platform
to reach out to millennials, the Gen-Z and first-time voters.

In the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, Twitter and Facebook played an important
role in social media campaigns. Political parties woke up late to the
influence of Instagram. All national political parties, barring
Congress, opened their official Instagram accounts only after the 16th
general elections were over. Congress posted its first picture on the
platform in March 2014. BJP started using the platform officially in
2015, followed by Trinamool Congress in 2016 and Aam Aadmi Party in 2017.

SYDNEY, Australia — Even when you know little about a country’s internal
politics, aspects of it can seem eerily familiar. “How to Rule the
World,” a new play by Nakkiah Lui for Sydney Theater Company, is deeply
rooted in Australia’s cultural landscape: Jokes about the former prime
minister, Julia Gillard, or the state of Tasmania may well escape
visiting foreigners. Yet much else in this smart comedy resonates across
borders.

For starters, it reaffirms that in today’s interconnected world, the
rise of populism and culture wars around diversity are global phenomena.
Ms. Lui, a decorated writer and actor of Indigenous Australian descent,
riffs on them with confidence in this sharp-witted tale, in which three
highly educated millennials from minority backgrounds (Indigenous
Australian, Asian and Pacific Islander) attempt to change the political
scene from the inside.

Caught between ageing parents and adult children, the going can be tough
for the sandwich generation, writes Joanna Davy

The sixth edition of the Australian Oxford Dictionary, released in 2017,
included more than 2000 new words to reflect the evolution of the
English language in the nation. Alongside *millennial* newcomers such as
“Insta” and “whatevs” was the “sandwich generation”, a term used to
describe the group of people caught between the responsibilities of
caring for ageing parents and adult children.

"Big Bang Theory" star Mayim Bialik thought she was helping Millennials
when she offered tips on how to avoid burnout but the target audience
instead found it offered more condescension than useful advice.

In a video posted to her YouTube channel Thursday, Bialik, 43, offers a
series of ideas she thought would benefit Millennials (people aged from
23 to 38 according to Pew Research). She advised them to "slow your
roll," "lower your expectations," and "buckle down. "

Millennials more often than any other generation receive a lot of flak
about the way they work and are often the fodder for negative
stereotyping. While generation-bashing is not new, stereotyping is never
productive.

That is why I hate to be the bearer of the following bad news. I really
do. But here it is-evidence that comes straight from the mouths of
millennials: Millennials believe they lack adequate negotiating skills.
This is especially the case when it comes to making major purchases,
such as cars, but it could also extend into key business decision-making.

Brexit and the internet are killing bricks-and-mortar retailers. That is
the received wisdom. And it looks likely to be received more frequently
in coming weeks than a consignment of sprouts from Brussels. One
supermarket boss fears a backlash against physical stores if shelves lie
empty post-EU withdrawal. Clothes store owners already blame online
rivals for their downward sales spiral. But there is one high-street
retailer able to challenge this received wisdom and envisage generating
£12bn cash in the next 15 years while keeping stores open: Next.

Having devoted September's halfyear results to a meticulous study of
cross-Channel supply lines, chief executive Simon Wolfson has again
shown the merit of being more trainspotter than Del Trotter. Alongside
yesterday's full-year results, he published what Citi called a "retail
masterpiece of analysis" countering investor intuition, and stress
testing Next's business model to 2034.

Sales are growing fast, but it’s an acquired taste

When the FT mail room informed me that two bottles of ice-cold camel
milk had arrived, my heart dropped. I had spent weeks researching and
championing camel milk’s status as the “future of dairy” to my
colleagues; now I had to taste it. As I went to try the surprisingly
thick beverage, my nose wrinkled, my lips pursed. I realised that
something I had not expected was holding me back: prejudice.

After this year's particularly brutal instalment of the annual Ezra
Avenue St. Patrick's Day insanity in Waterloo, local authorities have
two choices.

They can stay the course, wait until someone is critically injured or,
heaven forbid, killed at one of these illegal, uncontrolled student
street parties and then, with heads bowed, do exactly what the ensuing
public inquiry tells them to do.

Winky Lux, the fast-beauty company that produces lipsticks and mascaras
in a matter of weeks, keeps its product innovation ideas flowing with
the help of its 50 employees.

Rather than delegate product development to a dedicated in-house team,
the company has a formal monthly pitch program where all employees can
participate. At these meetings, employees come prepared with product
ideas (based on their own research and vetting) that they present
to Winky Lux CEO Natalie Mackey and evp of product development Kristen
Leonard. Approximately 20 percent of all Winky Lux products that hit the
market emerge from these meetings, said Mackey. Most recently, the pitch
meetings generated the brand’s Matcha Blotting Papers, released in
March, and a rainbow lip balm that will debut in June.

The *millennial*-driven ombré trend that struck everything from hair
color to special order Frappuccino drinks in 2017 may be waning across
social media, but the color effect is only gaining momentum in fashion.

With a flock of designer labels including Oscar de la Renta and
Valentino using ombré tulle and feathers in their 2019 collections, and
tie-dye and spray paint effects on the rise in sportswear and
streetwear, this spring denim brands are dabbling in gradients.

The US tech giant has unveiled a new video-on-demand platform with a
string of much-awaited original shows. Apple no longer wants to just
sell devices, but put its original content on them too.

"It's show time," proclaimed the invitation to the launch of Apple's new

heightened speculation about the tech giant's ambitious plans to take on
Netflix with a $1 billion+ (€879 million) investment in original
entertainment.

Levi Strauss made an initial public offering Thursday morning, marking
the second Wall Street debut for the iconic jean maker in its 166-year
history.

Late Wednesday, Levi's priced its IPO at $17 per share - higher than the
estimated range and valuing the company at $6.6 billion. The stock will
trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the LEVI ticker symbol. On
Thursday, the NYSE loosened its dress code so traders can wear denim.

With the launch of its Medical Professional Mortgage Product, TD Bank is
leveraging an opportunity to attract new customers and to address what
it says is a knowledge gap among this group of professionals.

Less than one in five medical students are aware of mortgage offerings
for their field, and nearly a quarter of those who are in practice claim
student debt made buying a house more challenging, according to TD Bank.

Brie Larson has already conquered the box office this year with the
record-breaking success of “Captain Marvel,” and she’s set to do it all
over again at the end of April with the release of “Avengers: Endgame.”
In between those massive Hollywood tentpoles, Larson will return to her
indie roots with the release of her directorial debut “Unicorn Store.”
The quirky comedy-drama premiered at the Toronto International Film
Festival in 2017 and will finally get an official release thanks to Netflix.

The official synopsis from Netflix reads: “After failing out of art
school and taking a humdrum office job, a whimsical painter (Larson)
gets a chance to fulfill her lifelong dream of adopting a unicorn.”
Larson has assembled a strong ensemble cast to play opposite her in
front of the camera, including her “Kong: Skull Island” and MCU co-star
Samuel L. Jackson, as well as Hamish Linklater, Joan Cusack and Bradley
Whitford as Larson’s parents, and relative newcomer Mamoudou Athie.

In recent years, the corporate world has given rise to a new figure: the
Ladyboss. The Ladyboss is usually white. She is usually young. She is
usually pretty. She pays lip service to promoting diversity and equality
in the workplace, even though it’s hard not to notice that there are
very few people of color being promoted to leadership roles, and that
the office maternity leave policy sucks (if there is even one to begin
with). Perhaps she will take on a protégé, or a string of protégés, all
of whom, despite living in a state of constant terror, are awed to be in
her presence. None of them will last longer than a few months.

One of the first to offer individual paid-for videos on its iTunes
platform in 2006, Apple lags by several years in the launch of its video
subscription service and enters an already crowded market. Netflix,
meanwhile, has more than 146 million subscribers globally and is now in
more than half of all US households, while Amazon Prime is hot on its heels.

Masaba Gupta may not have dived into fashion, but she glided into it in
style, setting herself apart with her unique aesthetics. HerStory caught
up with the young designer as she sets shop in Namma Bengaluru on the
10th year of her label.

Boxes have a unique place in fashion. They look great on shelves, are
easily accessible, and help segregate one label from another. But
fashion also liberally boxes in people - XS, XL, for peach-shaped body,
for hour-glass figure, women-only, festive-special, strictly formal,
etc. Since the fashion world has no dearth of labels it is refreshing to
see someone move past the stereotypes that perpetuate fashion for the
sake of fashion, and look at making it into a profitable venture that
addresses needs.

In their Indie Beauty Profile, Ndidi Obidoa and Chinelo Chidozie,
co-founders of Bolden, outline a mass market skin care brand for women
of color that has garnered shelf space at a major US retailer and neatly
defined a large consumer base.

Ndidi Obidoa and Chinelo Chidozie worked for nearly 3 years building the
brand and the business behind what is now Bolden. It’s a collection of
facial skin care and body care products for women of color that Obidoa
and Chidozie believe will one day be well-known, affordable, and
available to women around the world. Here, the beauty entrepreneurs
share a profile of themselves and the brand.

Healthy snacking brand Graze launches a new product every two days,
according to head of category development Penny Mackintosh. The group’s
agility reflects its close relationship with consumers - and their data.

Graze launched its subscription box service for healthy snacks in the UK
a decade ago. As much a tech company as a food maker, three years later
the group had already attracted 100,000 ‘grazers’ (as it calls its
subscribers).

MUMBAI: In this age of millennials, Simran won't run for Raj anymore and
Veer wouldn't care to wait for Zara. Love, lust and heartbreak- all
happens in a blink of an eye and it's time we walk away from old school
love solutions, typical love gurus and overrated happy endings. If
you're looking for something more fun, realistic and relatable, MTV
Beats has the perfect fix for you with India's current heart-throb and
your new Love Dost, Darshan Raval. Ruling hearts with his music which
connects with the youth and nuances of love, the singer will be seen in
a new avatar on Dil Beats starting 27 March 2019.
