Fashion juggernaut Uniqlo has continued to rapidly grow its share of
Australia's apparel market at the expense of struggling local retailers,
reporting growth of 25 per cent this year.

Uniqlo Australia's financial accounts, lodged with the corporate
regulator on Monday, show its gross sales increased by $63 million to
$306 million in the 12 months to August 31.

In a KakaoTalk group chat gathering 300 fans of Pengsoo, users vented
their anger when the character appeared at a promotional event for a
movie on Dec. 16.

Some of them insisted they should send emails of protest to the
production team at Educational Broadcasting System and ask them to
refrain from commercial uses of Pengsoo -- a costumed live-action
penguin character that has quickly gained popularity in Korea for its
straight-talking wit.
