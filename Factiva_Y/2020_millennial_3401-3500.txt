The Clorox Company is building an influencer advisory council.

The company is aiming to use the council, which will be comprised of
hundreds of influencers, to help it better understand the type of
content that will resonate with such individuals and their audiences.
The consumer goods company also wants to fashion a more collaborative
content-creation arrangement between these influencers and its organization.

*HD* 	Biden's Social Security Heresy; Bernie attacks Joe for even
considering entitlement reform.

Anyone who thinks American politics will enter a new period of
compromise when President Trump leaves the White House isn't watching
the Democratic presidential race. The left is unloading on Joe Biden for
the heresy of having once considered a bipartisan reform of Social Security.

With the Iowa caucuses two weeks away, the Bernie Sanders campaign is
rolling out oppo research showing that Mr. Biden once said he'd consider
cost-of-living "adjustments" in Social Security. In Bernie-speak, this
always means "cuts."

When the newly rebranded Parkroyal Collection Marina Bay completes its
revamp in 1Q2021, the hotel will be the first “garden in a hotel” in
Singapore, touts Pan Pacific Hotels Group (PPHG). Formerly known as
Marina Mandarin, the hotel offers 575 guest rooms across 21 storeys,
boasting 611,648 sq ft of floor space.

In April 2019, the acquisition of the remaining interests in Marina
Centre Holdings gave UOL Group and United Industrial Corp full control
of Parkroyal Collection Marina Bay. This in turn “gave us a lot of
opportunity”, shares Liam Wee Sin, group chief executive of UOL Group.
Liam wants to rebuild and rebrand the former Marina Mandarin into
another green hotel, following the success of Parkroyal Collection
Pickering (formerly Parkroyal on Pickering), which was built a decade ago.

Today's young adults are starting their lives on drastically different
financial footing than their parents did decades ago. Necessities cost
far more and wages have flattened; as a result, many young families have
to dig through mountains of debt before they can even think about
growing their wealth.

A data point from the Federal Reserve, highlighted recently in a special
report on housing by the Economist, underscores the differences between
millennials' financial trajectory and those of earlier generations: In
1990, baby boomers, whose median age was 35, owned nearly one-third of
American real estate by value.

New Delhi, Jan. 20 -- To address the issue of mis-selling and
overcharging from investors in the capital market, the Securities and
Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has proposed client segregation for
entities providing both advisory and distribution services. This means,
a company with both advisory and distribution arms will be able to offer
either financial advice or product purchase to its clients. Sebi has
also proposed capping investment advisory fees to 2.5% of the assets
under advice (AuA) or a flat fee of Rs.75,000 per year.

The proposals were part of a consultation paper on Sebi-registered
financial advisers (RIAs) that the regulator unveiled on 15 January. The
paper noted that there have been numerous complaints about investment
advisers promising assured returns, charging exorbitant fees and
mis-selling products.

Hanfu is the traditional han-ethnic attire of China. The history of
hanfu can be traced back to 4,000 years ago. In China's 24 dynasties,
hanfu has different styles while retaining a common style of being
elegant, simple and natural.

The main features of hanfu are cross neck, hidden knot, knotted sash,
tensile waist, and you put the right side above the left. The last
peculiarity is a singular symbol of han ethnicity and if you put the
order upside down, it means clothing for the dead. Also for many
minority ethnic groups of ancient China, it takes the left side on top
of the right. Here, we present the style of hanfu worn by four-term women.

It's official: Generation Z women are now entering motherhood. This may
shock some marketing professionals who are still perplexed over the
behaviors of the *Millennial* Mom, and this is certainly not intended to
make anyone feel old.

The reality is that generations span 20 years — and yes, we've been
discussing Millennials for two decades. Generation Z spans births from
1996 to 2010, making the oldest women 24 years old. This is just two
years short of 26, the average age for first-time mothers in the United
States.

Sustainability and reducing the ecological impact of their operations is
one of the main concerns of department store and self-service chains. In
fact, he was one of the main players in the annual convention of the
National Retail Federation (NRF, equivalent to Mexico's ANTAD in the
United States).The concept is closely related to business continuity,
initiatives for the business to thrive or even exist in the long term
That's why it touches on areas such as the environment, the impact on
the community, collaborators, suppliers or privacy issues.

Customers are demanding that sustainability be in the strategy.
According to firstinsight consultancy, 62% of *millennial* consumers

Last year, one in four countries was rocked by extreme cases of civil
disobedience, and many analysts agree that the trend will continue in
2020, with about 40% of the world affected by violent protests. The
causes of these phenomena are necessarily many and very varied, but
there is a type of element that I would like to emphasize, because in my
opinion it has not been sufficiently taken into account.

Cherry is a 27-year-old *millennial* living with five members of her
family in their Regent Park home. As a part-time retail worker and DJ,
she doesn't have a set income. Cherry estimates she makes anywhere from
$1,300 to $1,900 a month - depending on how many gigs she books.

Because of her circumstances, she thinks it's very important to live a
modest lifestyle. Besides paying $200 in rent to her parents monthly,
she saves a lot on food costs. She'll eat breakfast at home, while
usually relying on meal prep for lunch and dinner (even at the club). To
feed her caffeine cravings, she makes instant coffee and brings it
everywhere in a to-go mug. In fact, there are several days in her
average week when she doesn't spend a single dollar.

What Nehru warned about

Jawaharlal Nehru, while addressing an open session of the All India
Congress Committee in New Delhi in May 1958, said that the “communalism
of the majority is far more dangerous than the communalism of the
minority.” He reasoned that such communalism “wears the garb of
nationalism.” “We have thus communalism ingrained in us and it comes out
quickly at the slightest provocation and even decent people begin to
behave like barbarians when this communalism is aroused in them.”

Walk into a supermarket and it is impossible to miss the assorted range

solutions promising the sensitive-nosed, freedom from allergic reactions
and others come in convenient packs, optimised for small urban households.

For Lizol, the Reckitt Benckiser (RB) brand that has spent close to two
decades in the Indian market, the fight against this crowd of
challengers is not just another turf battle. The new brands not only
threaten its crown, in the Rs 1,000 crore market (industry estimates

Yes they look cool and yes they’re incredibly efficient – but
ultimately, they just do the same thing as our bogstandard chargers. Right?

The southeast corner of 10th and Ellis was the epicenter of Jack
Connell's business empire.

It's where the legislator held court with everyone from judges to
janitors at the Sandwich City diner. It's where his Merchants Credit
Bureau agency still operates.

For those attending CES 2020 last week, there was a whiff of
disappointment in the air that there weren't enough breakthrough
"things," and the existing technologies were in the process of evolving
rather than disrupting.

As a volunteer floor guide for CES at Tech West and Eureka Park, I heard
this firsthand from clients, but for me the story this year was about
the foundational technologies, 5G, Wifi 6, biometrics, AI and voice
assistance, and how smart combinations of existing technologies are
pushing the envelope.

Less than three weeks into the new year you could be forgiven for
already looking forward to your next holiday as the reality of workplace
life sets in.

If you were looking to ease back into the swing of things but have
already been disappointed to find you’ve got more work than time, the
radical approach of workplace expert Dom Price might appeal.

Spoiler alert! We're revealing plot details for Tyler Perry's new
Netflix movie "A Fall From Grace." Stop reading now if you don't want to
know.

If you've long been a supporter of Tyler Perry's projects – what with
their punny titles, two-timing men, soap opera lighting, courtroom
melodrama, memorable wigs and conservative takes on gender roles – then
by all means add his new Netflix film "A Fall From Grace" to your queue.

As 2020 gets going, it's worth looking back at another year in which
home sellers did well in some markets, but often at the expense of home
buyers.

First, in much of the country, home prices rose again in 2019. According
to the November Zillow Real Estate Market Report, home values grew an
average of 3.8 percent, and the median home value in the United States
is $243,225. The median list price per square foot in the United States
is $154. The median price of homes currently listed in the United States
is $284,999, while the median price of homes that sold is $236,900. The
median rent price in the United States is $1,650.

When employees experience personal trauma, challenging transitions in
the workplace, difficult relationships with managers, etc., some of them
will choose to "off-ramp," a term referring to those who voluntarily
resign or reduce their working hours. Many employers will be familiar
with an employee deciding not to return to work from a
pregnancy/parental leave. However, off-ramping is becoming more common
for several reasons.

We live in an age of increased workplace stress (not to mention societal
stress in the form of newspaper headlines), and burnout has now been
recognized in the International Classification of Diseases as an
occupational phenomenon.[1]

Although South Korea is recognized in the West for K-pop culture and
*millennial* beauty routines, Seoul hides a dark secret among its lights
and music. Young people burdened with economic and professional success
have become the Sampo generation, known for sacrificing three aspects of
life in exchange for work: relationships, marriage and children. So, as
millennials dissatisfied with their lives seek solutions in the market,
the government is trying to stop the decline of the population of Asia's
fourth-largest economy.

South Koreans reached a new all-time birth rate in 2018, with 0.98
children per woman, the lowest in the world against the global average
of 2.5 children.

Often touted as the world's last great untapped market, the Muslim
travel sector is gaining prominence in the tourism industry, with
distinct patterns and trends coming to the fore as the segment swells in
numbers.

In 2018, the global Muslim travel population clocked at 140 million,
according to the Mastercard-CrescentRating Global Muslim Travel Index
2019. The index projected that by 2026, this figure will surge 64 per
cent to reach 230 million.

'Generation
Rent[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/buy/number-young-homeowners-will-halve-2026-four-ways-make-sure/]',

This age cohort (those born between 1977 and 1995) paid £37.3 billion in
rent last year, which is around £1 billion less than what they spent in
2017, new data from Hamptons International have shown.

There are only a few hours left before Christmas Eve, but Amandin
Ohayon, CEO of Pronovias, has to serve an American media outlet after
chatting over the phone with this newspaper. If these dates are usually
busy in a company that, although recognized for its wedding dresses, is
also a specialist in party costumes, this year surpasses the usual
trajín: Pronovias opened boutique in Beverly Hills on December 30.

Before becoming one of the greatest filmmakers in history, Federico
Fellini dreamed of being a great cartoonist. Dreams, it is known, the
work of the Italian brims. About the end of her career, the dreamst
returned, but this time for the small screen, when she made a series of
notable television commercials. Five in total and there, once again, the
territory of the amazing, the unreal, the fears and fantasies, manifest
themost mastery. 100 years after his birth, it is worth rescuing this
lid that, due to his monstrous film work, goes unnoticed in reviews and
profiles as data to fill a CV.

Looking back both works has its charm. Fellini's work opens on paper and
closes on television, but the beginning and ending are tightly linked,
forming a Moebius film where only one face exists, even if they look
like two.

Evo Morales got away with it. The indigenous leader has imposed from his
exile in Buenos Aires who will be the presidential candidate of the
Movement for Socialism (MAS), which will compete to regain the power
lost in the general election of May 3. This is former Minister Luis
Arce, the great architect of the economic bonanza achieved during
revolutionary management.

"Our duo Luis Arce and David Choquehuanca is a combination of scientific
knowledge and *millennial* original knowledge, the unity of the
countryside and the city, body and soul. We have a political liberation
project that has shown that another Bolivia is possible," stressed
Morales, campaign manager of the MAS who cannot be a candidate after
being the main protagonist of the 20-O voter fraud, which ultimately
precipitated his downfall and subsequent exile.

Hanoi received the clock, which has a diameter of 13 meters and a height
of 1.8 meters, from the Swiss city of Bern on the occasion of its
*millennial* anniversary celebration in 2010.

JLL observes that there are hundreds of million dollars waiting to be
poured into the market in most segments of real estate.

The urbanization phenomenon in today’s fast-paced world is inevitable,
especially in emerging economies. Vietnam’s population has grown rapidly
from 66 million in 1990 to 96.5 million in 2019. This makes Vietnam the
third most populous country in Southeast Asia after Indonesia and the
Philippines.

TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Gerindra Party politician Kamrussamad considered
President Joko Widodo or Jokowi's remarks about Sandiaga Uno as a
potential candidate for the 2024 presidential election a mere gimmick.
He opined such statements aimed at diverting public attention from
sensitive issues and the government's works in the spotlight.

"Such as the scandal of Jiwasraya, Asabri, the premium hike of health
insurance BPJS Kesehatan, the polemic of the plan to increase the
three-kilogram LPG, and the failure of the government to protect Natuna
territorial waters," Kamrussamad told Tempo on Monday, January 20.

Bengaluru, the pensioners' paradise of India, has turned into the
technology capital of the country, as it remains in the forefront of
tech-driven innovation, with the city possessing all the ingredients in
terms of people, infrastructure, and know-how to keep this a pulsating
as well as a vibrant destination for the startup ecosystem today.

Technology and research & development (R&D) devoted to science have long
been the hallmark of the city. The establishment of the Indian Institute
of Science (IISC) way back in 1909 is also a testimony to the fact that
technology is deeply rooted in the city.

Quinoa has got competition. Fashionable food tags such as #organic,
#glutenfree and #superfoods have pushed the humble millet right up the
2020 menu of the health-conscious *millennial*. #climatechange is
another surprise tag that's pro millets - as the focus this year is
predicted to be firmly on regenerative agriculture. Experts say millets
will fit this slot neatly, and cruise along with faux meat products,
probiotics, and fat-burning foods as a leading food trend globally.
Plus, rising concerns of carbon dioxide levels sapping nutrients from
crops have made dishes made from millet greens and non-traditional
flours from its byproducts healthy and hip.

On the evening of December 15, as protests around the Citizenship
Amendment Act and police action were unfolding in New Delhi's Jamia
Millia Islamia, a student, Shreya (name changed), fired up her Instagram
app and started posting."It is very easy on Instagram, given that it
allows you to upload abstracts, she told ET over the phone. "For
instance, my friend was posting articles - taking parts of it,
highlighting it and putting it up on Stories (a popular Instagram
feature that lets users post ephemeral content - text, photos and
videos)."This was just one of the hundreds of examples of how Instagram
became the social media forum of choice in the charged CAA debate.
Instagram's prominence in this round of India's digital protests is
important for two reasons. First, most users are presumed to be under
the age of 25, and the young have led protests.

Six years since the entry of streaming services into the Philippines,
Asian streaming platforms HOOQ and iflix have pronounced that the
industry has emerged from infancy and consider 2019 a turning point,
with more originals being produced and the entry of more players
signifying that the Philippines has fully embraced a new way of
consuming content.

"The plethora of choice is a clear indicator of growth. New streaming
services serving up documentaries (iWonder), and reality shows (Hayu)
launched in the past year - and there is a market for them. AppleTV and
Disney+ will make the playing field more diverse, for the audience at
least," Sherwin dela Cruz, country manager of iflix Philippines told
BusinessWorld in an e-mail interview in December.

This reporter visited Taipei last December to cover the presidential
election in Taiwan. Young Taiwanese in their 20s described themselves
'Born independent.' It means they were raised believing Taiwan is an
independent country. 'This is why we cannot accept China's one country,
two systems,' said a Taiwanese university student.

Taiwanese who are in their 20s and 30s see themselves as Taiwanese, not
Chinese. Their votes were what secured the second term of Taiwanese
President Tsai Ing-wen who opposes closer ties with China. What has
given them strong Taiwanese identity was the country's democratization.

During the summer season of radio, I did a session on Radio National
talking about “*Millennial* and Gen Z speak”, the new “language” of the
young that those of us born “a while ago” find puzzling and sometimes
confronting. Since then I’ve been receiving a steady flow of emails
requesting information as people missed part of the chat.

Well, buckle up folks because some of the language is just odd, while
some is rude and other parts a bit confronting. Let’s first define
“Millenial” and a “Gen Z” people shall we? Authorities agree that
Millennials were born in the period 1981–1996 inclusive.

If you haven’t heard of PUBG, you are obviously living under a rock. The
multiplayer first person shooter game is after all the big rage in the
gaming circles. While video games mostly get a bad rap, some for good
reasons, it’s now bringing in a new *millennial* trend in to the office
– rage-quitting. FYI, rage-quitting is a gaming terminology that is a
condition in which gamers, who, through steady provoking and not being
able to handle losing, leave mid-match. It is categorised by violent
behaviour like throwing away the controller, punching seats, yelling and
cussing. In the workplace, rage-quitting is quitting without notice out
of pure anger.QUIT IN STYLE?It has also become the fodder for viral
videos. For instance, former flight attendant Steven Slater cursed out a
rude passenger over the PA system, grabbed two beers, deployed the
evacuation slide and slid down the chute.

Zolo, Nestaway, Guesture, Oyo Life are among a clutch of brands pitching
plug-and-play residences for a new generation of professionals

A young, unmarried couple agonises over life lived under the scrutiny of
landlords, while a newly-minted professional talks about spending all
his time on the road in Bengaluru because he can’t afford a house close
to his office. Advertisements for co-living spaces, the slickly made
films that have been released on digital media are pushing the sector
under the spotlight. Having relied largely on word-of-mouth
communication, broking agents and direct mailers until recently, a band
of brands such as Oyo Life, Nestaway, Zolo, Guesture among others have
dialled up the noise around their services. The aim: build awareness,
recall and reserve a premium spot in the rapidly growing business of
co-living.

There is a wide range of nut butters, lactose-free yoghurts that are a
tad expensive but great for health

It used to be regarded as the ‘white gold’ and a powerhouse of good
health once upon a time, for its dense nutrients and its
immunity-building properties. Over the years, however, milk began
falling out of favour with a health-conscious urban mindset for a
variety of reasons such as dairy allergy, lactose intolerance, hormonal
imbalances and a fad-driven shift to veganism. And the figure-conscious,
of course, ditched it in order to shed a few pounds here and there.

I am back from 7 weeks of travelling in the USA/Canada. As soon as
people realised that I was Australian, they asked me about the
bushfires. Without exception, they were all sad for the koalas and
kangaroos. Not one person asked me about the personal loss of life and
homes. I found that odd. Is that a result of the media coverage they
were seeing, or something sadder? SMG

GCB reported on 17/01 of a gang of youths terrorising schoolchildren and
demanding their shoes and mobile phones, yet no adult male came to their
aid to protect them, talk about gutless. In our Baby Boomers day this
would never have happened. If it had, the male public would have given
them a good hiding, so would the police, and then another big thrashing
by their fathers. Let the public deal with today’s violent youth crime
and it will disappear overnight. KenW.

The debt collection fintech chaired by former NAB and Tyro Payments
executive Gerd Schenkel and backed by billionaire Paul Little is set to
list on the Australian Securities Exchange after completing a private
$9m capital raising to purchase an associated debt recovery agency.

Credit Clear’s recent purchase of Credit Solutions, which has
debt-collection contracts with a large number of Top 50 Australian
companies, will give the merged group the ability to collect
earliest-stage debts (less than 30 days) through to more delinquent
debts (more than 90 days).

FOOD at Victoria’s police academy has copped a ­grilling from trainee
officers. The quantity, quality and variety of food has been branded
suspect. But one senior police officer said food-fussy “*millennial*
recruits” needed to toughen up. The police union late last year surveyed
police and protective services recruits about meals at the Glen Waverley
academy, telling members: “Responses have revealed mostly
dissatisfaction across cohorts with the breakfast, lunch and dinner
provided at the academy.”Assistant Commissioner Kevin Casey said a
leading dietitian who conducted a ­review into the food at the academy
found it was ­“exceeding nutritional requirements”. However, a senior
officer was more blunt: “*Millennial* recruits whinge about everything —
literally everything.”

You wouldn't give a mortgage to an 18-year-old. No bank would make a
$30,000 car loan to a 21-year-old without a co-signer. A 19-year-old
couldn't get $100,000 to start a business without putting up some
serious collateral. But taking out $50,000, $100,000, $150,000 in
student loans? It's as easy as signing your name.

Currently, I have $71,135.31 in student loan debt. It is in a total of
seven loans, ranging from $2,200 to $22,000. I required loans to pay for
both my bachelor's degree (Smith College) and my master's degree
(Simmons College). The exact amount I owe fluctuates constantly -
interest piles up every single day, and then once a month I pay $140 and
knock it back - but it has remained terrifyingly stable at around
$70,000 since 2015, which was when I took out the last one.

Ahead of Australia Day, Leader Newspapers spoke to 20 Melburnians from
all walks of life about what being Australian means to them.

From the charitable small-business owner and sport-loving religious
leader to first-generation Aussies carving their futures and a
determined 10-year-old battling a rare disease, they all shed light on
our nation’s strengths — and its weaknesses.

When Marvel Bar, the Minneapolis cocktail lounge, reopened earlier this
month after a winter break, something was missing behind the bar: the
alcohol.

Top-shelf liquors were replaced with an elaborate installation of dried
flowers. A counter that once held 192 bottles of whiskey is now a
bookshelf featuring, among other titles, Anthony Bourdain’s “Kitchen
Confidential,” a pocket guide to herbs, and an illustrated volume on
cats that live in distilleries.

STOUGHTON - Under the harsh light of fluorescent bulbs in an unadorned
warehouse, Claudia Manzanilla picks up a stiff mink pelt and runs her
fingers along the silvery fur.

In less than a second, she assesses the length of the fur, sorts it and
grabs another seemingly identical pelt from a pile of stiffened animal
skins.

The year gone by certainly wasn't a cakewalk for the Radio industry,
with the country's economic slowdown and monetary crunches due to a
muffled festive season. However, with newer formats making it to the
platform and a series of other innovations with regard to content,
programmatic, focus on data and analytics and more, most Radio players
have kept their fingers crossed for the transformation they hope the
yearAn unprecedented Podcast BoomA primary focus of the Radio industry
in 2020 would be to pivot from being Radio only, to a digital first
medium. With digitization coming into play, both consumers and brands
are now expecting holistic solutions. It's imperative for us to use new
digital channels to reach the digital audience and work on amplifying
the current revenue stream. One of the major headways into this area
will be the entry into podcasts.

The sophomoric title of pop-rockers The Ridley's new album can be
off-putting at first brush. It brings to mind a collection of high
school literary pieces aimed to impress pre-adolescent friends and peers.

First track 'Aphrodite' opens with 'You're the moon that glows in the
sky' which deserves a wry chuckle while the accompanying instrumentation
reminds of a light-hearted Orange and Lemons. The follow-up starts on a
quasi-'Tin Man' riffs which the four-man boy band manages to extend to
something lush and interesting courtesy principally of guitars that
quietly build to ear-grabbing hooks.

MUMBAI: Renowned TV actor Nakuul Mehta, who is gearing up for the web
series "Never Kiss Your Best Friend", says he was initially a "little
sceptical" to take up the role in the show, a story of two youngsters.

"Initially I was a little sceptical if I would manage to get the youth
vibe right, because on television I have done some work that was quite
serious and intense. This show is full of youthfulness, it speaks the
language of the *millennial* and, for me, it was a little challenging.
Since it was challenging, I thought it would be exciting to be part of
the show," Nakuul told IANS.

<th>Pity the fiction writers trying to make art in the era of
social-media mobs. Start with one in particular, “a nonbinary human …
who loves to dream and create.” Last week, this young writer asked on
Twitter, “You know how there are sensitivity readers, courses, and
guidelines for writing outside your own experience? Can there be courses
and advice for writing one’s own experience?” This young writer used to
believe that “writing about my marginalizations and my own personal
experience will be okay”—no more. “I have learned that is not the case!”
this young person observed, fretting that, without meaning to do harm,
“I might be writing my gender wrong.”

What made this young person fear that honest writing about their own
gender identity could be “wrong” and hurtful, rendering it not “okay”?
Watching a trans author get dragged for unorthodox art.

Amid the Alpine peaks of the Swiss resort of Davos in the week ahead,
politicians, investors and executives will be busy debating whether we
are witnessing peaks in key drivers of the world economy.

From oil demand, car production and the proportion of young people as a
share of the population, to less-measurable themes like globalisation,
inequality and central banking power, there’s an argument each will ebb
in the 2020s.

Deals are being finalized. Queens are being placated. Titles are being
relinquished. And soon, Meghan and Harry will be just another couple of
*millennial* house hunters trying to get the most bang for their buck,
likely in Toronto or Vancouver.

But until then, Harry had one, final
royal[https://www.thestar.com/news/world/royals.html] job to do in jolly
old England: "One more royal engagement before I jet off to beautiful
Canada? Sure, I think I got one more in me! Here it is. ARE YOU NOT

Ahead of Australia Day, Leader Newspapers spoke to 20 Melburnians from
all walks of life about what being Australian means to them.

From the charitable small business owner and sport-loving religious
leader to first-generation Aussies carving their futures and a
determined 10-year-old battling a rare disease, they all shed light on
our nation’s strengths — and its weaknesses.

So you’ve already devoured all the shows which nabbed awards and made
headlines at the Golden Globes — Fleabag, Succession, Chernobyl and
Morning Wars – and fear there’s nothing left on the box to entertain,
apart from celebrities eating entrails in the jungle or cricketers at
the crease.

Well, all is not lost just because it’s non-ratings season. There are
still plenty of shows worth binge-watching this summer.

Across the globe, babies are a commodity in dwindling supply. In the UK,
US, Japan, Europe and even parent-friendly Scandinavia, birth rates are
falling.

The spectre of an inverted pyramid of massed elders, precariously
balanced atop a shrinking working population is one to give social
policy-makers nightmares. Yet it is easy to understand why my son’s
generation of twenty-and thirtysomethings might retreat from the
prospect of parenthood[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/family/parenting/].

Bhubaneswar, Jan. 19 -- Groww, a leading investment platform that allows
zero commission investing in mutual funds, recently conducted 'Ab India
Karega Invest: Bhubaneswar Chapter' - an interactive event raising
financial awareness in the capital city of Orissa. The event, which saw
active participation from aspiring and seasoned *millennial* investors
alike, was held at The Presidency Hotel on 17th January 2020. The
two-hour event covered an array of topics, ranging from benefits of
mutual fund investments, dos and don'ts of investing, and prospects of
India's mutual fund industry. It was kick-started with seasoned
investors sharing tips and tricks of mutual fund investing. This was
followed by an interactive session, where participants were given a
chance to ask questions and clear their doubts. The overarching idea
behind this initiative was to break common investing myths and help
young investors make well-informed investment decisions.

Don’t worry if you’ve already devoured a stack of hit shows, films,
music and podcasts on your holidays, there’s still plenty of
binge-watching and listening to do.

MUSIC Prince – 1999 (Super Deluxe Edition) This one may have slipped
under your release radar as it came out in late November. There was a
physical box set going for $400 but you can also take the streaming
route and enjoy 65 songs — the final recorded versions, demos and live
cuts — when you have a spare five hours and 53 minutes. This opus was a
major crossover moment for the legendary artist courtesy of pop hits
including 1999 and Little Red Corvette.

It is small, discreet, but behind its antique wooden doors houses the

authentic atmosphere of this state enhanced with the *millennial* work
of the artisans of this region of the south of the country.

It is Escondido Oaxaca, a hotel that barely opened its doors last
November and has 12 great suites for the traveler to relax at ease, in
an atmosphere of sophistication and tranquility.

Joe Biden commands a boardroom. Meeting with the Times editorial board
on Dec. 16, he moved fluidly among policy issues, though at times he
became tangled in his own syntax and fell back on what President Barack
Obama famously referred to as his verbal ''flourishes.'' Mr. Biden said
his eight years as vice president and his deep relationships on Capitol
Hill, where he represented Delaware in the Senate, would help him step
seamlessly back into public office. He promised, ''If I'm able to pass
what I'm talking about, my administration would go down in history as
one of the most progressive administrations in American history.'' ¶ He
also discussed reparations, his decadeslong political history starting
with a county council run and questions about his personal health given
concerns about age and the presidency. ¶ Here are excerpts from the
90-minute discussion's annotated transcript.

The foie gras truffle torchon at the Beatrice Inn in Greenwich Village
is a decadent indulgence: four discs of silky duck-liver mousse paired
with triangles of buttery toast, all arranged on a silver platter. The
appetizer goes for $28 -- a gateway, perhaps, to the menu's $375
Porterhouse steak. The restaurant serves about 200 pounds of foie gras a
week.

''There's nothing like it,'' said Angie Mar, the restaurant's chef and
owner.

Derrius Quarles is a man of many modes, but he's perhaps best known for
founding Breaux Capital, an online financial platform and community for
black *millennial* men (the name is a play on the word ''bro''). Having
read that 70 percent of black millennials couldn't afford a $1000
emergency, he created an app that automates savings and co-invests the
money with two friends: Ras Asan, whom he met on a summer study abroad
trip to Ghana, and Brian L. Williams, a fellow graduate of Morehouse
College. ''We work with anything from traditional ETFs'' --
exchange-traded funds -- ''to the cannabis industry,'' Mr. Quarles, 29,
said.

'With so many lodging choices, wine programs offer companies another way
to stand out.'

While overall wine sales have slowed in recent years, at least in the
United States, oenophiles have started to consume more -- and demand --
better quality wines. To attract this traveler, hotels and resorts are
increasingly ordering private-label bottles, producing their own and
ramping up wine-centric experiences.
