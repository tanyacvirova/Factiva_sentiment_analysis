The recent Global Digital Traveller Research 2019 by Travelport
highlighted that millennials in India seek a premium digital experience
across all aspects of travel. Another key finding was that travellers in
India want and expect travel providers to help them personalize their
experience seamlessly. The research surveyed 23,000 people from 20
countries; including 2000 from India of which 1,526 were millennials (in
the age group of 20-39 years).

It revealed that Indian *millennial* travellers were one of the world's
most likely (84%, above the global average of 71%) to consider it
important that an airline offers a good digital experience - for
instance, offering online check-in and gate information. Similarly,
Indian millennials were the world's most likely to consider the digital
experience when booking hotels (e.g. having a room key on their
smartphones) - 82% in India considered it important, well above the
global average of 58%.

1128 ET - Polaris sees a resilient consumer and economy as a trend that
will continue in 2020 for the powersports industry, Chairman and CEO
Scott Wine says on a call with investors. But the company is also
watching out for recession signals, Wine says. "Recession risk is likely
to rise throughout the year, and we will remain vigilant and ready with
our contingency plans," Wine says. The powersports company has stronger
growth expectations in the Asia-Pacific region, and it sees lower tariff
effects with the US's phase-one trade agreement with China, Wine says.
Polaris shares are up 3.5% on higher 4Q profit and sales, although sales
missed analyst expectations. (dave.sebastian@wsj.com; @depsebastian)

Delivery has been a huge disruptor in the restaurant industry. But is it
here to stay? How do you make it pay?

The restaurant food delivery sector has exploded over the past few years
with third-party apps – most notably Deliveroo, Just Eat and Uber Eats –
vying for business and reporting significant gains for those businesses
using them.

1053 ET - Sprint's financial health and performance in the final three
quarters of 2019 provide a glimpse of what the company might look like
if it is unable to merge with T-Mobile, Nomura Instinet says.
"Standalone Sprint is not on a healthy trajectory and is sensibly
preparing to refocus should the deal break," the firm says, adding it
believes Sprint is considering a narrower focus on metro markets. The
company is less promotional and much of its postpaid additions came from
data devices, not more lucrative phone additions, Instinet says.

10:48 ET - If you employ Gen Z and *millennial* workers, be prepared to
face bolder negotiating tactics. Nearly 60% of such workers say they've
leveraged a potential job offer as a negotiation tactic for more pay at
their current firms, in contrast to just 48% of Gen X employees and 29%
of boomers, according to survey findings from Randstad US. The survey
also found younger workers have higher expectations for raises, with 74%
of millennials saying they expect a raise every year to stay at their
companies, compared to 62% of boomers. Employers should "be more aware
of their compensation offerings in order to stay competitive," said Jim
Link, chief human resources officer, Randstad North America.

*HD* 	Why ‘getting smart’ on philanthropy makes sense for advisors;
Becoming more in tune with philanthropy requires getting a good grasp of
the various types that exist to guide clients who are looking to give to
worthwhile causes

Many Canadians are putting their money toward worthwhile causes such as
fighting climate change, tackling homelessness or supporting
international development. But are they aware of all the ways they can
have an impact and do so in a way that integrates with the rest of their
financial plans? That’s where financial advisors can help – and
addressing clients’ philanthropic goals makes good business sense, too.

According to Ellen Remmer, senior partner at The Philanthropic
Initiative (TPI) in Boston, “advisors who can talk about these issues
with their clients and prospects develop deeper relationships.”

This is the second in a three-part
series[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/consumer-affairs/make-1pc-millionaire-millennials/]
from The Telegraph on how young people make and manage their money

In today’s social media era, where appearance is everything, a share
certificate no longer cuts the mustard, explained 32-year-old watch
collector Silas Walton. “Young millionaires want to show off their
wealth: you can’t wear stocks and shares so they put their money
elsewhere,” he said.

Even just talk of a possible recession can trigger anxiety for anyone
who associates it with the major economic downturn of a dozen years ago.
But history doesn’t always repeat itself.

“The financial crisis in 2008 was basically the second-worst recession
ever after the Great Depression in the last hundred years; it doesn’t
always have to be like that,” says Luke Delorme, director of financial
planning at American Investment Services. “There are relatively mild
recessions that aren’t so impactful.”

India, Jan. 28 -- Actor and columnist Pooja Bedi's daughter Alaya F has
been making waves even before the release of her upcoming movie, Jawani
Jaaneman, alongside Saif Ali Khan and Tabu. The young *millennial*'s
acting in the trailer of the movie won her a lot of appreciation, but it
is her directness and brazen honesty that is a breath of fresh air in
the new generation of actors, and we can't help but wonder if, after
Sara Ali Khan, Alaya F could be the next *millennial* icon, style and
all. In fact, Alaya was recently in the news for giving some super
snarky answers about her contemporary, Ananya Panday on Zoom's chat show
By Invite Only. When asked what Alaya has that Ananya does, Alaya said,
"Ananya Panday doesn't have a good answer on nepotism but I do." She
even spoke about wanting to do a steamy love-making scene with Kartik
Aaryan, after she saw his scene with Sara in the Love Aaj Kal sequel,
admitting she has a bit of fondness for Kartik.

If the Hyperloop – ultra-fast transportation that zips you to a city and
back in next to no time – is a reality, will there be such a need to
stay in hotels on business? Work on the Hyperloop is speeding up and the
futuristic transport solution could be a reality sooner than we think.
You could take a business trip and return the same day.

Will there be only leisure hotels then?

Democrat Ted Terry dropped out of the crowded race against U.S. Sen.
David Perdue on Sunday to run for an open seat on the DeKalb County
Commission, leaving three top rivals competing to challenge the
Republican in the nationally watched contest.

The Clarkston mayor told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that his
fundraising struggles -- his latest disclosure showed him with roughly
$60,000 in campaign cash -- contributed to his decision to abandon a
race expected to set spending records.

India, Jan. 28 -- Sara Ali Khan is by far the most relatable
*millennial* actor, she is funny, doesn't shy from speaking her truth,
is extremely humble and polite, and has absolutely no airs about her.
And unlike most Bollywood actors who seem to be blessed with the best
genetics be it their looks or their physique, Sara was not afraid to
share her struggles with weight loss and with PCOD (Polycystic ovary
syndrome) that led to her excessive weight gain. The Love Aaj Kal and
Kedarnath actor recently took to her Instagram and put up a super
adorable and cheeky post from her pre-weight loss day and we have to say
she looks just as adorable as always. She lost the weight but the
cheerful personality is still the same. Sara captioned the video,
"Presenting Sara ka Sara Sara. Let's make 'light' of what it was...
Let's also make it lighter than what it was."

When Satoshi Nakamoto first described Bitcoin in 2008, there was little
way of knowing what a behemoth the asset would become over the following
decade. Dominating media headlines with its meteoric price rises and
inspiring a slew of copycat coins, Bitcoin has served as both the
blueprint for a decentralised economy, and an entirely new class of
digital assets.

But while Bitcoin has made substantial progress in establishing itself
as a store of value, its usefulness as a means of exchange has been
eroded. Heavy speculation and high transaction fees has resulted in most
users holding Bitcoin for the long-term, especially given the asset's
all-time highs of almost £15,000 per coin.

New research links chronic stress with a litany of health conditions —
here's what to do about it. By John Naish

Is your career killing you by stealth? If you feel excessively tired,
devoid of energy, demoralised and irritable, you have the classic
symptoms of a condition with disastrous potential: occupational burnout.

A New South Wales post office is under fire for posting an ad for a
retail traineeship on Thursday that barred millennials from applying.

Social media users were quick to react to the last criteria posts on a
Seek ad posted by the privately-owned Warilla Licensed Post Office on
the NSW south coast, which has since been removed.

Peru's Agricultural People's Front (Frepap) was not in the polls or in
the Peruvian press before last Sunday's parliamentary elections.
However, this far-right political party has become one of the eight
parties that will have representation in congress: the formation will
have 16 out of 130 seats in a Parliament marked by fragmentation since
no party has a majority.

Frepap's leader is Ezequiel Jonás Ataucusi, son of the founder of the
Evangelical Association of the Israelite Mission of the New Universal
Covenant (Aeminpu), Ezequiel Ataucusi Gamonal. The organization is
mainly religiously for purposes—in the South American country they are
known as the Israelites—but it also has a political impact in some
regions and represents Frepap's main social base.

French youth willing to join the underground battle against the Nazis
during World War II faced rigorous screening from Jacques Lusseyran. The
experienced operative made on-the-spot assessments of their capabilities
and character that would determine whether they could join the
Resistance or not.

While the idea of youth taking up arms is strange enough, even more
noteworthy is the fact that Lusseyran was blind — the result of a
childhood accident — and, as a teenager himself, was as young as many of
his interviewees.

News | Her life dominated by work and the grind of being a
twenty-something in the city, Alice Vincent was surprised to find
herself craving something strange - gardening. She explains how her
interest bloomed, and the way it saved her during dark times

When I first started to take an interest in plants, somewhere in my
mid-twenties, it was to embark upon a journey that unspooled slowly.
There was nothing showy about it. If anything, I kept it deeply hidden.
To be addicted to gardening was considered strange and dowdy, a habit
enjoyed by the elderly or the tedious.

leapfrogged past her *millennial* fellow nominees and took home Album of

AS the digital age surfaced, the gig economy formed its own market at
its peak with no plans of slowing down. Indeed, the World Bank data
underlines that in 2018 itself, 25.3 per cent of the Malaysian labour
force are freelancers and it puts our country’s gig economy as growing,
to as much as 26 per cent of the total economic growth. Prime Minister
Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad had said that the gig economy will be made part
of the 12th Malaysia Plan. Generally, it is like working in a free
market system whereby workers are allowed to work independently without
being tethered to long-term contracts with any company. In Malaysia, the
most common gig economy jobs are those related to e-hailing and delivery
services like Grab, Foodpanda and Gojek. The reason why more people out
there, especially the fresh graduates, opt for the gig economy is simply
because it is not easy to secure a permanent job nowadays. As of
November last year, the number of unemployed people was at 513,900.

Given that digital media consumption has seen a massive surge over the
past decade, it’s no wonder that artistes who have a huge fan following
on social media platforms are among the most sought-after offline too.
The growing popularity of YouTubers, DJs, stand-up comics as well as
reality TV stars on college campuses attest to this new trend. These
social media celebrities are now judging competitions at city colleges,
while some also perform during events. What’s making them such a rage
among youngsters?Students find these artistes more friendly and
relatableThe popularity of these celebs on social media automatically
translates to them having a bigger influence on the young demographic,
says Ushua Prashant, a student of Mount Carmel College. “The audience at
college fests mostly comprise those under the age of 22. Again, it’s the
same age group that spends most of their leisure time on social media,
watching these celebs’ videos or browsing through their pictures.

The number of Americans living in multigenerational households is at a
record
high[https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/04/05/a-record-64-million-americans-live-in-multigenerational-households/]
and stretches across all ages. Young adults are now most likely to live
with other generations, whereas previously it was adults aged 85 and
older. With residences containing a significant span of age groups,
smart retailers need to recognize the necessity for a tiered
merchandising strategy for consumer products.

The rise of multigenerational households means there are multiple
decision-makers with shopping responsibility. This requires retailers to
account for differences in generational attitudes regarding brand
loyalty, price sensitivity, and perception of value.

Grocers seeking younger customers need to focus on technology and
convenience.

According to the “Consumer Connect Q4 2019” study from retail market
intelligence firm IRI, the number one factor that will attract Gen Z
shoppers to a particular grocery store is technology that makes shopping
there more exciting (57%). While a good assortment of prepared/easy prep
meal solutions comes in a close second (56%), Gen Z also look for
grocery store features including online purchase with in-store pickup
(46%) and subscription services for frequently purchased items (33%).

The tight labor market has been an issue in the HVACR industry for
years, and with record low unemployment numbers, it is becoming even
more difficult for contractors to find and hire technicians. This
coincides with the increasingly easy ways in which companies can
actively recruit employees, such as through online sites LinkedIn or
Glassdoor, which means technicians know exactly how much they are worth
to competing contractors.

That is why it is so important for contractors to be more creative in
retaining the valuable workers they already have. Some are doing this by
beefing up their tangible benefits, such as better salaries, health
insurance, and vacation time. But a growing number are taking a closer
look at some of the intangible things they can do to keep their
employees, such as hosting employee appreciation events, eliciting (and
acting on) feedback, and taking the time to tell workers individually
that they are valued by the company.

upping the ante in terms of their offerings and overall concepts.

First conceived as a multicultural nursery rhyme brand (with a heavy
Latinx influence) in 2015, Encantos Media Studios has spent the past
four years aiming to inspire “21st-century kids to learn 21st-century
skills” through direct-to-consumer bilingual apps, sing-along videos,
books and other family-friendly content.

Last year alone, one of Encantos’ brands, Canticos, won a Kidscreen
Award and was nominated for a Daytime Emmy. In March 2019, Encantos
named Steven Wolfe Pereira as its CEO, and a couple of months later
introduced its newest brand, Tiny Travelers, which focuses on geography,
language and culture.

It turns out that most everyone, regardless of age — *millennial*, Gen
Xer or baby boomer — is stressed out about retirement, according to a
survey from the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors.

The survey, which assessed the financial health of Americans, found that
stress around finances transcends generational differences. In fact, 74%
of respondents said they want a financial planning do-over.

Detroit's three casinos are betting big on sports gambling with
expectations for the newly legal activity to generate a fresh customer
base and millions of dollars in additional revenue.

Even before sports betting became legal in December, MGM Grand Detroit's
$6 million Las Vegas-like sports lounge was open.

The city's fine-dining lunch scene, overrun as it is with upscale food
halls, continues to get smaller, but for our annual Best New Restaurants
feature, we managed to find several that are great for entertaining
clients. For good measure, we threw in a few more casual spots that rose
above the rest.

This year's crop of Super Bowl commercials will feature two drag queens,
an all-female cast and a "Queer Eye" guy. It's a step by Big Game
marketers to better represent modern society by casting more diverse
ethnicities, lifestyles and cultural perspectives. It's an effort that
shouldn't further fracture a divided nation, but Sabra Chief Marketing
Officer Jason Levine says, "Inclusive marketing, even under the best
intentions, can find itself feeding into the divisiveness of the country."

And if there is one goal nearly all Super Bowl LIV advertisers have,
it's to not alienate a particular group or political ideology.

Where to holiday with friends in your early 30s? Having outgrown the
traditional raucous ‘girls trips’ destinations of our 20’s, however fun
they were, and keen to avoid the failsafe city break after a busy
summer, I found myself a little out of ideas. Not to mention the stress
that was trying to coordinate everyone’s erratic diaries and finding we
could only manage a long weekend in the end of September. With only 4
days to play with, we were keen to avoid longer flights, ruling out the
likes of Greece and Turkey, destinations typically lauded for breaks
this time of year, for the fear of cutting short our much anticipated
R&R (read as Rose and Relaxation) time.

Three millennia ago an Egyptian priest named Nesamon used to sing to the
god Amon in the temple of Karnak during the reign of Pharaoh Ramses XI.
After three thousand years of silence, Nesamon's voice was heard again
thanks to a team of scientists who moved his mummified body to Leeds
General Hospital to try a novel experiment: reconstructing the priest's
vocal tract to try to try figure out what the sound of his voice was.
The mummy was X-rayed to print this tract from a 3D printer, and the
results of the study, published in the journal Scientific Reports,
allowed to outline what Nesamon's pronunciation of something close to
the vowel "e" would sound like in ancient Egypt .

When Angie Tebbe and Eric Carl launched their women’s ingestibles
company, Rae Wellness, last September, they found that running it wasn’t
dissimilar to their experience working as Target executives — though
their budgets and resources were much more limited. Tebbe and Carl had
helped carve out nascent brands at the Minneapolis retailer for about 13
and 14 years, respectively. Tebbe spent most of her time in fashion and
home merchandising, while Carl concentrated on commodities, like health
products and grocery.

In addition to fueling the founders’ interest in wellness and the
supplement category, where Rae Wellness sits, their experiences at
Target gave them insight into the mass-market female consumer, as well
as where the retailer had significant white space or was looking to
invest. They didn’t get pure beauty experience, but they got a landscape
view that has become more important for founders today to possess.

Scary. Disgusting. Wrong. Dirty. Stressful. Unnatural. Unsafe. It was
sad and exasperating by turns listening to the young women on Chidera
Eggerue’s eye-opening documentary describing their perfectly normal
pubic hair like a particularly virulent form of invasive species.

I sighed and snorted at the show’s premise. Eggerue – a 24 year old
author and social media influencer – was “challenging herself” and five
friends to let their pubes grow out for six weeks. As a busy mum in my
mid-forties, my idea of “a challenge” would be to give my bikini line
any consideration at all on a day I’m not going swimming.

2020 JAN 27 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at
Journal of Engineering -- Fullscreen, an Otter Media company and a
global leader in social-first entertainment, serving both talent and
brands, announced the findings from its new Industry Insights report:
"The Next Gen Family." Focused on *Millennial* parents (36 million
Americans in the 25- to 37-year-old age range with at least one child at
home), the survey extracted deep insights for brands on this "Parennial"
demographic, the first generation of parents to grow up with social
media and emerging technology as part of their communication and content
consumption patterns. As this cohort - making up more than half (55%) of
all Millennials - enters the next phase of their life and overwhelmingly
uses technology to help them parent (as 96% admit), they are approaching
parenting, families and children in completely different ways than prior
generations that have ROI implications for brands.

2020 JAN 27 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at
Global Warming Focus -- Investigators publish new report on Climate
Change. According to news reporting originating from Melbourne, Florida,
by VerticalNews correspondents, research stated, "Corals of the eastern
tropical Pacific live in a marginal and oceanographically dynamic
environment. Along the Pacific coast of Panama, stronger seasonal
upwelling in the Gulf of Panama in the east transitions to weaker
upwelling in the Gulf of Chiriqui in the west, resulting in complex
regional oceanographic conditions that drive differential coral-reef
growth."

Financial supporters for this research include U.S. National Science
Foundation, Coastal/Marine Hazards and Resources Program of the U.S.
Geological Survey.

A dog and its owner stroll past on the sidewalk. Round the dog's neck is
a lanyard. Davos gets even more surreal

The air is crisp. The roads are icy. Snowy mountains stretch to the sky,
surrounding the village of Davos like walls. This valley is the eye of a
storm known for its annual gathering of elites. Over 50 years, it has
hosted leaders in policy, religion and business. It is called one of the
most exclusive gatherings in the world, and this year it is also
welcoming young activists.

A significant number of millennials planning to purchase their first
home during 2020 have not yet taken the financial steps necessary to
successfully complete the process, a TD Bank survey found.

Just over half of the 850 people between 23 and 38 surveyed, 52%,
started saving for a down payment although they intend to purchase home
this year. A similar number, 53%, have reviewed their credit report.

If you talk to the most passionate advocates for any Democratic
presidential contender, they'll tell you that their candidate will not
just beat Donald Trump in the presidential election, he or she will
destroy him. They each have their own theory about exactly why this will
happen — Joe Biden will win working-class whites, Sen. Bernie Sanders
(I-Vt.) will energize young people, etc. — but they're convinced that
their candidate is the only one who doesn't represent a huge risk of
Trump winning reelection.

But it's not too early to accept a fact about the general election, one
that will not change no matter who the Democratic nominee is: Not only
will this election be extremely close, it's going to be nearly
impossible to tell what will happen until Election Day.

Four generations interact in today's labor supply and demand, all
already with different experiences and conditions of employment, "and
above all, their talents are motivated by different goals" that
complicate framing the multifactorial characteristics of the work
"dream" agrees to point out specialists.

Baby Boomers (from 1949 to 1968) yearn for the bonanza of them and their
parents in quality positions and benefits. Mr. Vidales, septuagenarian,
a former bank of Mexico employee still remembers the sugar cost that
came suddenly and for now along with his monthly pantry box; "I had
benefits like show tickets, holiday discounts and my retirement didn't
just want her to live peacefully."

It's not every day you have one chance to see one of the romantic icons
of millennials throwing your competing counterpart something as thick as
"I'll bleed your body and bury it under a tree. A French tree." And that
is precisely what happens in one of the key scenes of The King, the
max-mix of Henry IV and Henry V directed by David Michad, author of
Animal Kingdom (2010), for Netflix: with a very affected Gallic accent
and grout of tarms malvado Shakespearean Robert Pattinson (United
Kingdom, 1986), as the Great Dauphin Louis of France, drops that pearl
on a Timothée Chalamet (USA, 1995) who, looking like a Jonah Trueba
dropped inside a Toledana armor that is comically inappropriate , gives
effortd encouragement to Henry V.

Chalamet has become coveted little after, in 'Call me by your name', he
was able to make a peach Satisfyer Pro for uncles

The online broker industry is in the midst of a sweeping transformation,
and investors like the changes, judging from their votes in IBD's eighth
annual Best Online
Brokers[https://www.investors.com/best-online-brokers/] survey. And one
thing's for certain: There's never been a better time to be an online
investor.

Competition is growing from new, low-cost players like the
microinvesting apps popular among *millennial* investors. So is pressure
from longtime competitors that have bulked up through mergers. The
result is an industry fighting to please investors so firms can thrive —
or survive. Witness big brokers' mass move to zero commissions last fall.

as a temporary option.
