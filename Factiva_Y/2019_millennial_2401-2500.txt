In the cult 1999 film about corporate malaise, the story of an everyman
rallying against his sedate life found itself a loyal following

Maybe it was Y2K anxiety. Maybe something was in the Hollywood water.
Whatever the reason, 1999 yielded a bumper crop of movies about angry,
ordinary men throwing off society’s shackles and finding something
extraordinary in themselves.

These revamped US motels combine modern style with retro touches and new
features, such as DJ sets and yoga classes

Not much remains of the Henning Motel in Newberry Springs, California.
Out on old Route 66, only the once-flashing neon sign still stands,
rusted beyond repair. The arrival of the Interstate Highway in the 1970s
rerouted custom elsewhere, and like thousands of motels across America,
its fate was sealed. These emblems of the American road seemed in steady
decline, that is, until recent years, when hoteliers began to recognise
the potential in their architecture and storied past, and set about
repurposing them.

I have no idea why the meme world hates South Bombay girls," says
Pune-based Anuj Nakade, 21, who is heavily invested in the *millennial*
phenomenon. In June last year, Nakade met with Trishla Talera of TIFA
Working Studios, an alternate platform for arts and design in Pune.
Then, the two decided to organise an event dedicated to understanding
the artistic and social dynamics of memes, which led to the first
edition of Meme Regime in September in Pune.

Jakarta, Feb 19 (Antara) - The drugs proxy war has targeted Indonesia`s
*millennial* generation, as is indicated by increased smuggling of drugs
into Indonesia, according to Speaker of the Indonesian House of
Representatives (DPR) Bambang Soesatyo.

"Over the last two decades, Indonesian children and youths have
obviously become the targets of the proxy war," Soesatyo noted in a
statement here on Tuesday.

FASHION has already stepped back to the 90s with crop tops, chokers,
bucket hats and backpacks - and now square-toed shoes have returned, too.

The first stirrings of flat-ended footwear came last year, with brands
like Jil Sander and Toga including squared-off boots and Mary Janes in
their collections.

Hong Kong's retail landscape is in danger of falling behind, as
*millennial* and Generation Z consumers, who continue to influence the
future of retail by setting new benchmarks for the industry, demand
digitally-engaging, entertaining and shareworthy experiences. I believe
a fundamental mindset shift is needed to deliver these experiences and
secure Hong Kong's retail competitiveness moving forward. To
reinvigorate retail, the answer could lie in addressing one of the
city's major challenges: a lack of pedestrian-friendly urban space.

From shirts made of beach trash to swimwear made from fishing nets,
fashion is dumping synthetics for more sustainable alternatives

PET bottles, fishing nets and polythene bags may not be your typical
idea of fashion, but clothes made from trash are increasingly making an
appearance on Indian catwalks and in wardrobes as designers get
innovative with sustainable alternatives.

When it comes to the startup culture, it is often referenced with
stereotypical benefits: flexible work hours, a large floor office space
with unconventional furniture and millennials in Friday casuals typing
away on their computers.

Avendus Capital has started accepting money for one of India's first
funds to base investment decisions on environment, social and governance
parameters as investor concerns about governance at Indian companies surge.

"Traditionally, university endowments and pension funds tend to
participate in ESG. But we are now seeing a lot of appetite also from
*millennial*, high net-worth investors and family offices," Abhay
Laijawala, managing director at Avendus Capital Public Markets Alternate
Strategies, said. "The compelling newsflow around climate change and
work-related issues is driving this shift."

IT’S the *millennial* version of the chicken versus egg riddle. If I’ve

That’s right, I’ve officially been blocked on Facebook. For all I know,

The next episode of Koffee With Karan will see Kareena Kapoor and
Priyanka Chopra on the couch. The two look stunning in the promo
released by the channel. While Kareena can be seen all glam in red,
Priyanka is sporting a neon yellow jumpsuit.In the teaser, Karan tells
Kareena and Priyanka who would have thought that the two would be on his
sofa together. The two actresses break into laughter. He then asks
Kareena to give him some breaking news. An amused Kareena wonders why
she would do that. Priyanka tells her because she is the 'karta dharta
of gupp' (gossip-monger). The gaming round sees Priyanka Chopra clueless
about Jonas' brother's first album. Kareena is surprised and asks
Priyanka how could she not know. The latter replies she didn't google
him before getting married.When Karan talks about Saif's proposal to
her, Kareena reveals it was in Greece where they both were shooting.
Priyanka finds it uncanny as she, too, was proposed by Nick in the same
country.

The 10-year challenge, capturing the change in one’s physical appearance
from what it was a decade ago to now, has become a social media craze.
While participating in such challenges can make you feel good for some
time, there is little beyond that. On the other hand, if you set
yourself a financial challenge, it might not garner any likes or
comments as it is private in nature, it could make a qualitative
difference to your future.That is what Mumbai-based finance professional
Sandeep Singhal, 29 has done. The *millennial* set himself the challenge
of prepaying his Rs 40-lakh home loan, which has a balance tenure of 18
years, within the next 10 years. Instead of paying the prescribed
equated monthly instalment (EMI) of Rs 37,500, he has decided to direct
Rs 70,000 towards this purpose. The probable result? He will
successfully ace the challenge if he sticks to his plan over the next
six years.

undecided *millennial* women are likely to be a powerful voice in the
federal election result, and now Australia’s largest voting bracket has
revealed where its loyalties lie.

The Australian *Millennial* Report asked 1206 eligible voters (men and
women) aged 19-36 about their preferences and what they’d need to get
them over the line.

THERE has been a lot of airtime given in recent weeks to the federal
Opposition’s franking credit policy.

Depending on which side of politics you are on, the ALP’s plan to
eliminate cash refunds associated with franking credits has been
labelled either a tax on retirees or a responsible way to right an
unfair policy.

The look and feel of a restaurant is more important than ever in
determining whether it survives and thrives. We talk trends with four of
Australia's emerging designers.

The devil is in the detail. He (or is it she?) is in the red neon sign,
the tree-trunk pillars, the pink staircase, the end-of-Empire rattan
chairs and the velvet banquettes the exact colour of the moss you find
growing on rocks near flowing water.

At the same time that many media organizations have hitched their wagons
to a rabid anti-Trump narrative, many of them are struggling to survive.

The Wall Street Journal reported January 23 that "BuzzFeed is planning
to lay off about 15% of its workforce, according to people familiar with
the situation." In fact, BuzzFeed, considered by many to be "Fake News,"
has never actually been financially successful. According to the Journal
piece, the layoffs are part of a bigger plan "to get BuzzFeed on the
path to profitability and in proper shape as it scouts out potential
merger combinations with other digital media players," and "to help the
company avoid raising money again."

Talent Acquisition, Retention Still Top Concerns Among Employers

While there is some general optimism to be found in the results of the
latest Employer Associations of America National Business Trends Survey,
especially when it comes to projected revenues and plans for additional
hiring, the twin challenges of attaining and then retaining top talent
loom large in today's business climate.

Gargantuan college loans. Insufficient retirement nest eggs. Mounting
out-of-pocket medical bills. These financial stressors could cause high
blood pressure, migraines and other more serious health conditions.

Employers should understand that whether an employee is a *millennial*
struggling to repay student loans or someone close to retirement anxious
over an inadequate 401k, financial stress could not only ruin an
individual’s health, it could also reduce productivity and hit the
bottom line. How should companies respond?

The reaction to last week’s announcement that Latter-day Saint
missionaries will now be able to call home once a week — instead of
twice a year, as was the former policy — has been mostly positive.

Most families seem to be welcoming the change, which leaders of The
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints say will be a “motivating
force, not a distraction” in the lives of more than 65,000 missionaries
serving around the world.

What are the current design observations in the hotel sector?

Paola Mantello (PM), executive director for interior design, design and
technical services, luxury - MEA, AccorHotels: One of the enduring
trends that we are seeing in our industry, and where AccorHotels is
setting the pace, is laidback luxury. A luxury hotel experience is no
longer seen as being austere and rigid. There has been a shift in the
meaning and promise of this concept, and one of those traits that Accor
has correctly pointed out is laidback luxury and laidback living. The
focus around this trend is to create a ‘home away from home’ feeling,
especially around the guestrooms.

During the last two decades, consumer tastes and preferences have
evolved at an accelerating rate. Consumers demand more from consumer
packaged goods ("CPG") companies in the food, health/wellness, and
beauty/personal care industry sectors. With a louder voice and access to
online platforms and communities, consumers seek increased
ingredient/formulation transparency, less chemically-processed
ingredients, and "better-for-you" products.

In February 2018, the Los Angeles Business Journal asked me to respond
to a series of questions related to taking a closer look at how the
consumer goods and retail sector is working. I think it would be
interesting to look back at those questions and see how my answers
compared to what really took place during 2018 and what we can expect to
happen in 2019. Will the market continue to grow or will we have a
slowdown in the economy?

The first question was what do you anticipate is ahead for retail in the US?

It's a rallying cry for Democrats seeking the White House in 2020: fight
for Main Street against a system that benefits corporations and the wealthy.

More than a decade after 2008 financial crisis, which was sparked in
part by big banks making risky mortgage investments, it has become a
consensus position among the emerging 2020 Democratic field that big
corporations have gotten away with far too much for far too long at the
expense of middle- and working-class Americans.

Three online video channels designed to appeal to millennials have
collected tens of millions of views on Facebook since September. But the
pages pushing the videos do not disclose that they are backed by the
Russian government.

The pages are run by Maffick Media, a company whose majority stakeholder
is Ruptly, a subsidiary of RT, which is funded by the Russian
government. Although Maffick Media has hired contractors and freelancers
in Los Angeles in recent months, the company is not registered in the
US, it is registered in Germany.

NEW YORK -- Medical consensus holds that the benefits of a healthy sex
life extend beyond the bedroom. An active sex life, according to sexual
health expert Yvonne Fulbright, enhances the immune system. "Sexually
active people take fewer sick days," says Fulbright. This is because sex
increases the levels of antibodies that defend against germs, viruses
and other intruders that can cause illness. Researchers at Wilkes
University in Pennsylvania, for instance, found that college students
who had sex once or twice a week had higher antibody levels compared to
students who didn't.

Sex also improves bladder control in women by strengthening their pelvic
floor, which is important for avoiding incontinence, which affects about
30% of women at some point in their lives. Having sex is essentially a
workout for the pelvic floor and use of those muscles during sex
strengthens them.

Six in 10 New Jersey adults support legalizing recreational marijuana,
according to a report from the Monmouth University Polling Institute,
amidst an agreement Gov. Phil Murphy and top lawmakers struck last week
on legal cannabis.

The Monday poll, which interviewed 604 New Jersey adults between Feb. 8
and 10, found that 62 percent of respondents favored legalizing small
amounts of marijuana for personal use, compared to 32 percent of adults
who said no to the prospect of legal marijuana in New Jersey.

There's a new kid on the block when it comes to corporate governance
considerations for money managers: millennials.

This group, broadly defined as those born between 1980 and 2000, is on
the list of considerations for money managers and consultants when
considering investment portfolios — and also for the boards of the
companies they invest in.

It's never too early for young adults to start saving for retirement,
even if they're barely out of their baby-sitting years. Empower
Retirement brings home that message in its latest social media campaign
aimed at Generation Z, the demographic cohort following millennials.

In a series of animated videos on Snapchat and Instagram, Empower
engages the nation's youngest workers with quirky vignettes about the
importance of preparing for their financial well-being.

The push to attract *millennial* investors, and the trillions in assets
supposedly being transferred to us, has been a key driver behind recent
industry trends, especially technology, which is often sold as a sort of
magic bullet for bringing in next-generation clients.

But is it working? I'm doubtful.

Millennials are no longer young kids, and you'll think twice about
deriding them with generic tags like "unambitious" and "entitled" when
you meet this next generation taking power in Washington, and beyond.

"I continue to believe that all the problems we have today are
solvable," said Rep. Trey Hollingsworth, R-Ind., age 35 and a member of
the House Financial Services Committee. "Millennials are the largest
generation in the U.S. labor force, so we need to have a voice — just
like in the workplace, in the public policy forum."

Olay, once known as Oil of Olay, was one of Procter & Gamble's biggest
success stories of the previous decade, rising to $2.5 billion in global
sales. But it hit a growth wall in 2010, with precipitous declines,
especially in its two biggest markets: the U.S. and China. A
comprehensive makeover of the brand, including simplifying the product
lineup, upgrading retail presentation and packaging, launching new
products and overhauling marketing to appeal more to millennials, has
returned Olay to double-digit sales growth.

The marketing challenge

It's 2019, and blackface is big news. Again. While people weren't
exactly shocked that now-lawmakers from Virginia were racist in the
1980s, present-day marketers seem to be trying to outdo one another.
Blatantly offensive caricatures are popping up nearly every day: Prada
recently pulled golliwog-looking charms from the shelves, and Gucci and
Katy Perry have apologized for clothing and shoe designs that seem like
they were inspired by minstrel shows (see Brand Playbook, p. 20).

But questions about what exactly constitutes blackface and how much
intention matters miss the point: Kendall Jenner didn't put shoe polish
on her face in that disastrous 2017 Pepsi ad, but cultural appropriation
is and has always been a mainstay of a society (and an industry) awash
in structural racism. Maybe we shouldn't be surprised this is happening
now. Happy Black History Month.

When Adidas released an all-white "Uncaged" shoe as part of a special
Black History Month collection, the backlash came quickly.

"An all-white shoe for BHM? Really @adidas? Come on son! Do better
dawg!" tweeted a consumer who goes by @DigitalFile_Dee, one of many
tweets slamming the brand.

limited plantation company in 1965 and was listed on the Malaysia and
Singapore stock exchanges in 1967. It took on its current name in 1971

The field of Democratic contenders putting themselves forward to
challenge Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election will be one of
the biggest in the party's history.

Democratic candidates for president are selected, five senators have
already declared they are running and more candidates are expected to
nominate in coming weeks.

New Delhi, Feb. 18 -- The cover of the current edition of The Economist
depicts the rise of "*millennial* socialism". It is about the preference
for socialism among children born around the birth of the new millennium
and now stepping into adulthood. Who could have thought that, less than
three decades after the triumph of capitalism and globalization, The
Economist will have such a cover and will be carrying a leaderarticle on
the topic of the resurgence of socialism?

The end of communism, the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the
disintegration of the Soviet Union were supposed to have ended history.
This demonstrates, yet again, how remarkably difficult it is for humans
to predict the future. But, as Will and Ariel Durant write in their
book, The Lessons Of History, the first lesson of history is humility.

Being part of the MSME movement in the State of Maharashtra and also
actively involved with the IIT SMC Startup Eco system in Pune there is
one factor that has proven a dilemma to the captains of Industry.
Getting the right Talent for the Industry is posing as one of the
greatest challenges. After getting the talent, the second most challenge
is to retain the talent. So here we are in a situation that the Industry
needs its people and teams to run their business and the people who join
are in a continuous state of fluidity especially the ones called the Gen
Y. Industry Research reports tell us that 60%of the *millennial*
workforce have job hopped in the past 3 years.

A city’s image can be made or broken by the calibre of the occupiers it
attracts.

As global hubs adopt marketing techniques to lure big names from around
the world, the battle for the brands is on.The City of London is
a 500-year-old super-brand whose status and success is based on the big
names that operate within its boundaries.The Royal Exchange was founded
in 1565 by Sir Thomas Gresham as the hub of commerce for London’s
merchants and from that corner of Cornhill and Threadneedle Street the
UK’s powerful banking sector grew.In uncertain times, it’s vital that
the Square Mile continues to attract big-name companies from around the
world.

Beirut -- NEW YORK: American millennials - the generation of people aged
17-35 - are a popular target for advertisers and brands, but companies
risk missing out by approaching them as one homogenous population. From
Gillette razors to McDonald’s and American Express, every major American
company is touting its efforts to attract these young people, considered
the workforce of tomorrow and the new generation of consumers.

ExxonMobil and Chevron no longer hesitate to highlight their late and
forced conversion to the fight against climate change, a subject
important to millennials, who will suffer its most serious consequences.

The outlook for Egyptian consumer spending remains tepid in 2019 with
challenges ahead, but in comparison with last year the outlook is one of
recovery, albeit on a slow trajectory. Austerity measures, inflationary
pressure and unemployment, especially within the *millennial* and Gen Z
consumer groups will continue to weigh on consumer purchasing power in
the short term.

It's a rallying cry for Democrats seeking the White House in 2020: fight
for Main Street against a system that benefits corporations and the wealthy.

More than a decade after 2008 financial crisis, which was sparked in
part by big banks making risky mortgage investments, it has become a
consensus position among the emerging 2020 Democratic field that big
corporations have gotten away with far too much for far too long at the
expense of middle- and working-class Americans.

There are three types of individuals in today's workforce. First came
the baby boomers. Born between 1946 and 1964, most of them have, today,
reached their retirement age, while others are heading towards it.

The second group has the Gen X, sandwiched between the baby boomers and
the millennials. While there isn't a specific birth date of birth for
this class of individuals, most of them were born from the early-to-mid
1960s to the early 1980s.

Three online video channels designed to appeal to millennials have
collected tens of millions of views on Facebook since September. But the
pages pushing the videos do not disclose that they are backed by the
Russian government.

The pages are run by Maffick Media, a company whose majority stakeholder
is Ruptly, a subsidiary of RT, which is funded by the Russian
government. Although Maffick Media has hired contractors and freelancers
in Los Angeles in recent months, the company is not registered in the
US, it is registered in Germany.

SHANGHAI — White Day, a.k.a. the male version of Valentine’s Day, has
become increasingly popular in China, a country inundated with Eastern
and Western commercialized, romantic festivals. Celebrated one month
after Valentine’s Day, on March 14, the holiday became popular in Japan,
before spreading to other East Asian countries, including China. The
concept behind the day is that men are repaid by their loved ones for
the effort they put into making Valentine’s Day special.

The year 2019 has relatively started well for the gold and diamond
jewellery industry. Looking back at the first quarter of 2018, the
volumes of jewellery sales in the UAE have been impacted by the
implementation of VAT effective from January 1, 2018. As with other
cases of tax implementation, this was a period of readjustment for the
economy and the industry, more specifically.

Are you curious about how much your fund selector peers earn?

Salary secrecy is one of the greatest taboos in professional life, but
this trend is starting to turn as reports on the gender pay gap and the
openness of the *millennial* generation promote more transparency when
it comes to income.

Millionaire idea. A comedy based on real events about everything that
has happened this season towards the Oscar. Well, it could be even comic
documentary, the fact is that in the beautiful tradition of And where is
the pilot? (Airplane) or Crazy academy of ... whatever you can think of,
it is everything that it gives in real life. I would love to tell this
story in the slapstick style (the genre that all those titles in Spanish
ended up with), but in the *millennial* style, starting with And where
is the driver? (of the Oscar) followed by a national version of And
where is the racist? Seriously. In more than 20 years of covering the
seasons of prizes, I have never seen so many stupidities, lack of
control and confusion for those from over there, as well as from here. A
quick summary of what they have announced and what they have later
retracted for the Sunday ceremony: "We will make the Best Popular Movie
category. No, not anymore They almost eat us alive for that.
