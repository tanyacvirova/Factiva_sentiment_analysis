It is a truth universally acknowledged that a *millennial* hunk in
possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife. Apparently he's
really, really in want of a wife. This week I watched the first nine
episodes of Love is Blind (Netflix), a programme in which young people
meet prospective mates in adjacent "pods", communicating only through a
glowing portal and then get married within six weeks of meeting. Kids
these days with their hippity hop!

This is basically what happens when the founders of Gilead watch Love
Island and Blind Date and say: "You know, if we made them wear clothes,
segregated them by gender, invented a 'dating pod' and it all ended in
marriage, we could have a lorra lorra laughs, Blessed Be the Fruit!"

Gurugram, Feb 28 (IANS) For HP Inc, Asia-Pacific was the fastest growing
market in its first quarter of fiscal 2020 and India is the bright spot
owing to its rising *millennial* and aspirational young population, a
top company executive has stressed.

HP Inc reported net revenue of $14.6 billion in the first quarter of
fiscal 2020 (November-January period) and free cash flow at $1.1 billion.

We need to talk more about debt, and I do not mean shaming people who
have borrowed a lot and are feeling stressed about it. What we need is
more sharing of stories about how people cope with and conquer their debts.

It’s this thought that made me want to feature Monique Shebbeare’s story
in this newsletter. Ms. Shebbeare is a 49-year-old lawyer in Vancouver
who specializes in wills, estates and fertility law. More than 15 years
ago, she was a Bay Street lawyer with big debt problems. Aside from the
mortgage on her condo, she owed $53,000 in student loans, various lines
of credit and a credit card.

SET-listed Dusit Thani Plc reported 6.1 billion baht in 2019 revenue
with a net profit of 320 million -- up 9.9% and 10.3%, respectively --
despite ongoing renovations to DTC's flagship hotel.

The company attributed the profit boost to a three-pronged strategy of
balance, expansion and diversification.

As the hot-cross buns lining supermarket shelves since Boxing Day
suggest, Easter is on its way. But before Easter comes Lent, a
traditional 40-day period of penitence observed by Christians worldwide.
Perhaps it is this looming Lenten season that has Elizabeth Farrelly
fixated on Sydney's seven deadly planning sins and preaching from the
pulpit: "Repent and be saved!"

The Sydney Morning Herald's colourful columnist's most recent offering
was a litany of NSW government projects dripping in sin. As a member of
that government, I have to admit the accusations of evil-doing sometimes
sting - though less so when they're couched in hokey caricatures and
dated references to Thatcher, neoliberalism and other kitsch from a
century long gone.

ARI SHAPIRO: *Millennial* and Gen Z shoppers concerned about the
environment are pushing fashion brands, especially purveyors of fast
fashion, to change their business models. Stacey Vanek Smith and Sally
Herships from our daily economics podcast The Indicator from Planet
Money explore how H&M plans to start renting clothing in a bid to appeal
to its environmentally conscious young consumers.

STACEY VANEK SMITH: So H&M has a problem. It sells fast fashion from the
best in the business, but its customers are mostly young shoppers, like
millennials and Gen Zers, and they increasingly care about the
environment and about labor practices.

OK, so this is fake news. Not the first part, but the second.

Dominick Gambino, of McCandless, emailed me a few days after Valentine's
Day to say he'd been biking in North Park and had encountered a couple
of abandoned pavilions in the woods that carried ancient carvings. He
sent snapshots along.

JPMorgan's planned move into UK retail banking has left analysts asking
how the Wall Street bank will stand out in a crowded field and avoid a
repeat of a digital snafu in its home market.

It emerged this week that the largest retail bank in the US by assets is
looking to launch a digital banking
service[https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/jpmorgan-to-launch-digital-bank-in-the-uk-report-20200224]
for British customers as early as this year and is seeking regulatory
approval.

Some rank-and-file Republicans are chafing at House Minority Leader
Kevin McCarthy’s climate-change rollout.

The Republican leader is pushing legislation to boost carbon capture and
tree-planting. But members in the House and Senate are openly
criticizing the agenda, reviving a long-held stance that climate policy
is alarmist, unnecessary, and runs afoul of free-market principles.

Retail plays a critical role in the overall Indian economy, being a
dynamic and evolving industry and being driven by changing consumption
patterns. Like all other industries, it goes through its cycle of ups
and downs in keeping with the macro economic cycles and sentiments. But
the overall retail eco-system - including retail brands, retail solution
providers across categories, retail consultants and others involved in
the retail business one way or the other - offers enough scope for
collaborations, partnerships and investments. So whether you are a
retailer looking to tap the Indian market, or looking to partner with
Indian retail solution providers for better in-store branding, or you
are a retail solution provider looking to collaborate with Indian
solution providers through investments or tie-ups or any other
partnership means, the Indian retail space has a lot to offer.

There’s beauty to spare in the new screen adaptation of Jane Austen’s
“Emma,” from its palatial country estates with their art-filled
galleries and manicured lawns, to the exquisitely detailed costumes
(those feathered bonnets!), to star Anya Taylor-Joy, whose porcelain
skin and blonde ringlets look like they belong in a Botticelli painting.

But wait, what’s the unsightly red gush from her nose that emerges
during a climactic romantic scene? Is Emma, um, having a nosebleed, amid
all this pristine beauty?

Ooh la la! No matter how many times a star in a see-through gown struts
down the red carpet, the public tends to react with raised eyebrows and
dropped jaws.

This awards season, from the Golden Globes to the Grammys, there was a
particularly high volume of oohing and aahing from stargazers because
many celebs have decided to go sheer this year, and the trend is
trickling down to the public, too.

He even played the classic Sonny & Cher tune for those gathered at the

If you're a *millennial* just embarked on saving and investing, you
should know the opportunity to put another $6,000 into your TFSA as of
Jan. 1 each year is one you shouldn't pass up. Why? There are a million
reasons why doing so every January for the next 45 years is your best
route to building a hefty retirement fund.

Unlike a million-dollar RRSP, a million-dollar TFSA is all yours to
spend, free of taxes on investment income and withdrawals. A $1-million
RRSP really belongs about 30 per cent or 40 per cent to the government
after taxes incurred once you start to withdraw from it.

romeo + Juliet Ballet B.C. is bringing back choreographer Medhi
Walerski's Romeo + Juliet, last seen here in 2018. Set to Sergei
Prokofiev's score, this contemporary version of the Shakespeare tale
features a minimalist set and lighting design by Dutch designer Theun
Mosk. Ballet B.C. dancers Emily Chessa and Kirsten Wicklund and Justin
Rapaport and Dex van ter Meij alternate performances in the title roles.
"Nothing on the Canadian dance landscape is quite like Ballet B.C., an
ambitious company that blurs the line between classical and contemporary
and finds its riches not through extravagant spending, but through this
kind of craft and thoughtful innovation," dance critic Martha Schabas
wrote in a glowing review of a 2018 performance. The ballet marks the
company's first since Walerski was announced as artistic director;
outgoing AD Emily Molnar has taken a gig with Walerski's former
employer, the Nederlands Dans Theater.

New Delhi: Shared economy in India is poised to become a $2 billion
industry by the end of the year, a report by Maple Capital Advisors said
on Thursday. Also, such services attracted about $3.5 billion worth of
private equity, and $262 million in mergers and acquisitions (M&A)
between 2015-19, the report titled 'Shared Economy - India Story' said.

The sector, predominantly driven by shared mobility, co-working,
co-living and furniture rentals, is pegged to be an about $2 billion
industry in the organised-end and growing in double digits, it said.

Our world is dangerously inflamed and imperiled — literally, politically
and always metaphorically — yet nothing remains as fascinating as
another person's travails, the next-door drama that's threaded in with
the mundane.

Bedtime and screen time, for example. Have you seen how other people
raise their kids? Have you seen how they keep house? Did you hear what
the husband said to the wife? Did you see their toddler throw a tantrum
in the pizza place?

Are campus snowflakes turning into champions at the workplace? The
exciting news is that many young American workers seem to have ignored
at least some of the lectures they received in college. Despite all the
bad news about the political environment they experienced in school, it
seems that a lot of millennials want to be challenged—one might even say
triggered.

Former Vice President Joe Biden “is counting on a win in the South
Carolina primary on Saturday to help position him as the leading
moderate challenger to” Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT). “But even if he
succeeds in South Carolina, his lack of resources and thin campaign
organization in California and other states that vote next week on Super
Tuesday present a daunting challenge to a candidacy already on
precarious footing.

“Interviews with party leaders in half a dozen Super Tuesday states
suggest that the same vulnerabilities that plagued Mr. Biden beginning
in Iowa … are holding him back in the states that next week will dole
out a third of the total delegates in the Democratic primary.”

Socialists are fond of modifiers these days. “Democratic Socialism”,
“21st Century Socialism”, “*Millennial* Socialism”, and, most absurd of
all, “Libertarian Socialism” and “Libertarian Communism”. When asked to
explain what those terms are supposed to mean, socialists argue as
follows: Socialism, like most ideologies, comes in different flavours.
It comes in authoritarian varieties, such as Leninism. But it also comes
in decidedly anti-authoritarian, anti-totalitarian varieties, associated
with names like Rosa Luxemburg, Karl Liebknecht, Emma Goldman or
Alexander Berkman. Leninists believe that a socialist society ought to
be run by huge hierarchical, top-down state bureaucracy. But libertarian
socialists believe in dismantling hierarchies, in grassroots democracy,
and in self-emancipation. Most contemporary socialists see themselves in
the latter tradition.

*HD* 	Expanding Maryland’s Sales Tax to Services Would Be Disastrous

Fueled by *millennial* generation and the “experience economy,”
Americans are now spending more money on services than goods.
Unfortunately, Maryland is seeking to penalize those who are embracing
such consumer trends by becoming one of the few states in the U.S. to
tax services.

HB 1628 proposes expanding Maryland’s sales tax to most services to pay
for the $32 billion Kirwan education initiative. The new tax would raise
the price of various services ranging from accounting and legal to hair
and nail salons. Even though the bill also proposes cutting the state
sales tax rate from 6 percent to 5 percent, expanding sales tax to
services would lead to a tax increase of $2.6 billion by 2025. According
to Gov. Larry Hogan’s office, this would be equivalent to a tax increase
of $1,708 a year for a family of four.

Can an eye-searingly colourful carpet, a massive model mash-up and a
load of VR headsets decode the architectural lexicon? Our critic finds
out at Space Popular’s energetic RIBA show

Do you know your ogee from your triglyph? Can you discern Byzantine from
baroque? What’s the difference between Tudorbethan and Indo-Saracenic?
The history of architectural styles can be a minefield of movements,
counter-movements and revivals, each enjoying its own obscure lexicon
and accompanying set of dense treatises and disagreements. But a new
exhibition at the Royal Institute of British Architects (itself an
intriguing 1930s hybrid of art deco and Scandinavian neo-classical, with
temple-like bronze doors flanked by stone monoliths) aims to make this
complex world accessible to all. It is a colourful, poppy history lesson
for the TikTok[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/tiktok] generation.

As part of the new releases of TNT Original, he came to the Screens As
couple, a film that portrays the conflicts of two young relationships
going through different situations in their sentimental stories, as well
as the complexities that anyone can experiment by living a romance.

m{707159}The feature film x-rays two distinct possibilities that love
gives in the stages of a relationship: on the one hand, the uncertainty
of moving towards a state where romance is already something known and
implies commitments that bring tension, conflict and disappointments; on
the other hand, that incipient love that the road adds some reasons to
take it more seriously, especially when two lovers of different calibers
come together who are surprised every day.

In another step to establish itself as a foods brand rather than just an
edible oil player, Adani Wilmar Ltd (AWL) has acquired a new logo for
its 'Fortune' brand.

Despite operating now in five categories including edible oil, pulses,
rice, wheat flour (atta) and sugar, over 90 per cent of consumers still
associate the Fortune brand with edible oil, said Angshu Mallick, deputy
chief operating officer of Adani Wilmar citing a survey.

Considering the slew of measures and policy reforms announced by the
government in 2019, for boosting real estate market, has a lot of
expectations from this budget for receiving the much needed stimulus.
There is a need to push for investment in infrastructure, relax income
tax slabs, infuse liquidity and most importantly implement effectively
all the measures announced last year.

Affordable housing needs to be taken into serious consideration if the
sector has to grow. Though affordable housing always formed the core of
discussion in stimulating housing real estate, growth in demand and
sales have remained slow in spite of efforts by government and private
players.

Right now, nothing seems to stop the Sanders flight, but many things can
still change among panicked Democrats.

Bernie Sanders, the presidential candidate for the United States, is
likely to have accomplished exactly what he wanted, which is to make
other Democratic candidates and party elites panic. There may be some
reason for panic, as Sanders has been very successful in the first
Länder primaries and electoral meetings.

financial returns is vital to help engage more investors, a law firm has
claimed.

Contrary to the perception that millennials are most likely to be
leading the way on ethical investing, research from Michelmores has

investment behaviour.

IF KLARNA's rise to stardom had seemed unstoppable, its latest results
will be a sobering return to earth. What's more, the Swedish startup
faces accusations its *millennial*-friendly service is dragging young
people into debt. Klarna users can pay back the full balance after 30
days, spread the cost over three monthly payments, or set up a financing
agreement. The firm makes money from fees to retailers and interest
charges for late-paying customers. Klarna says it has affordability
checks in place and never gives customers an open line of credit. Yet
consumer groups have issued stark warnings about Klarna and rivals such
as Laybuy and Clearpay and are calling for greater clarity over
repayment terms. The FCA last year launched a crackdown on buy now, pay
later firms, banning them from charging backdated interest on money that
had been repaid. But with the government ramping up measures to tackle
debt and public pressure mounting, it may be payback time for Klarna.

(GlobeNewswire) - According to the report published by Allied Market
Research, the global dating services market was pegged at $6.7 billion
in 2018 and is projected to reach $9.9 billion by 2026, growing at a
CAGR of 5.2% from 2019 to 2026.

Increased in the single or unmarried demographic segment, multiple
options facilitated by online dating services to higher rate of
subscription, and majority of the customers look for non-monogamous
relations have boosted the growth of the global dating services market.
However, fraudulent accounts resulting in apprehension among its
customers and unpaid customers hinder the market growth. On the
contrary, surge in social media marketing and rise in number of
*millennial* population are expected to create lucrative opportunities
in the near future.

Virgil Abloh, the founder of Off-White and the men's wear designer of

The Swedish online payments company which is trying to revolutionise
shopping with its "buy now, pay later" system has posted its first
annual loss, Klarna, which is aimed squarely at *millennial* shoppers,
yesterday unveiled a net loss of SwKr1.1 billion (£86.6 million) for
last year on sales of SwKr7.2 billion. In 2018, it made a SwKr161
million profit,.

Klarna blamed the losses on its investment in expansion and on higher
default rates, saying that "new market entries are likely to entail
higher credit loss during the initial phase". It is gearing up to be
launched in Australia and it has opened a technology hub in Berlin to
support its move into five more European countries.

Migration is an old topic. Man, from the dawn of his life on the planet,
seeks better living conditions and therefore constantly changes or migrates.

Today the maelstrom of communications and technological development lead
us almost to forget, the very recent migrations that have stowed to our
civilization. Today's news will be buried in a remote nearly
*millennial* past.

Why is it human nature to not immediately react to a situation where we
feel threatened or out of place?

Why is it that we wait, trying to adapt, and lacking the ability to see
the obvious opportunity which is ours for the taking? If only we could
shift our focus from the negative to the positive. What a joy it would be.

At Revera, challenging ageism is a passion. "I believe we must do
everything we can, not only to make the aging experience better but to
help the broader community appreciate the significant value that older
people bring to society," says Tom Wellner, chief executive officer.

Revera is a thought leader in the field of ageism through its AgeIsMore.
com platform and actively recruits employees in the 65-plus range. A few
years ago, the company proactively removed the upper age restriction for
hiring and employee benefits. With more than 800 people over the age of
65 working in its Canadian operations, Revera now has more older workers
than average across Canada, and the number continues to grow.

We've grown to admire Frankie "Kakie" Pangilinan's spunk and
indomitability ever since we read her outspoken views on different
issues on social media, some of them in direct response to trolls and
her dad Sen. Francis Pangilinan's political adversaries.

To defend her parents, she once posted one particularly vivid message
last December that, without being overly emotional or disrespectful,
went straight for the jugular.
