Last year was a landmark year for regulatory change across the European
financial services industry.

The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (Mifid II) came into
force on January 3 2018. And with the General Data Protection Regulation
introduced just four months later, it has been a busy year for European
businesses trying to stay on top of compliance.

One of the winningest moments in “RBG,” a documentary portrait of
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, encapsulates the charm that
has helped to make the dynamic 85-year-old an unlikely celebrity.

In the scene, filmmakers Julie Cohen and Betsy West surprise Ginsburg
with a clip of comic actress Kate McKinnon doing her famous
impersonation of the justice on “Saturday Night Live.” The moment came
at the end of an interview session with Ginsburg, in what West calls a
“hush-hush” formal room inside the court building, with several minders
standing by.

No I'm not channeling Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, and the opening line
of their Communist Manifesto, which appeared 170 years ago. I am

It seems like every time the topic of cars and millennials comes up, the
conventional wisdom is that millennials don't like cars and don't want
cars. Needless to say, if this generalization is true, it could be
somewhat worrisome for those in the collector-car business.

This year's Canadian International AutoShow opened with a Q&A session
between racer Townsend Bell and the CEO of the popular Barrett-Jackson
classic car auction, Craig Jackson. As far as Jackson is concerned, that
generalization is inaccurate.

glowing skin

Every time a facialist inquires about my skin-care regimen, it
inevitably ends with them shaming me for not using masks. You would
think my daily dose of SPF 50 or diligent double cleansing would earn me
some brownie points, but no. It's all "Masks are essential" and "Why
don't you use them?" followed by a sharp gasp when I finally spill the
beans: I just don't like them.

Now before my fellow millennials choke on their avocado toast, I'd like
to say I realize this admission is borderline sacrilegious. Don't worry,
though, I collect crystals and mainline almond-milk lattes like any
card-carrying member of our generation. But truth be told, I find nearly
all masks to be some degree of annoying. In sheet form, they are
ridiculously wasteful. In a pot, they inevitably make a mess, which
entirely nullifies the stress-reducing benefits.

I’ve driven past the Huntsman’s Inn, Falfield, dozens of times and
barely noticed it was there.

Curiously laid out along the A38, if it was not for the signs welcoming
you and suggesting you slow down a little it is possible to pass through
without realising the village is there at all.

Here’s a fun fact: afternoon tea came to be because a grumpy aristocrat
couldn’t make it through the day without a snack.

Queen Victoria’s Lady of the Bedchamber, Annathe Duchess of Bedford,
grew tired of having to wait for her late evening supper and
mid-afternoon would ask servants to sneak her tea and slices of bread
and butter.

"Back to the sources" became an intention, principle, purpose and trend,
of theologians, Bible scholars, liturgists, historians who loved the
study of Church Fathers, historians, philosophers, mid-nineteenth
century and early twentieth century.

"Back to the sources" was to go to the great events of twenty centuries
ago, which for the time being, filled ecclesial environments with many
surprises and a feeling that both the Church and the world had sent to
the ice of history great proposals that In the twentieth century, there
were truly remarkable losses for the Church and her historical environment.

'You could have gone out drinking on Hope Street, or stayed at home and

theory of relativity. That’s a beautiful thing.'

Coming from someone who stands at 6ft 8in tall, it may not come as a
surprise that I never thought I’d enjoy hearing someone tell me I’m
small and insignificant, writes Tom Houghton.

Out now in paperback IN BYRON'S WAKE by Miranda Seymour (S&S £12.99 560
pp ) PERHAPS to onlookers, all marriages seem mysterious, but few are
more perplexing than that of the poet Lord Byron and his unfortunate
wife, Annabella Milbanke.

The rakish author and the prim young heiress met in 1812 at a party held
by Byron's lover, Lady Caroline Lamb. After their introduction, Byron
wrote: 'I should like [Annabella] more if she were less perfect'.

Jakarta, Feb 22 (Antara) - The question implying whether women in the
Joko Widodo (Jokowi) era have more opportunities to become president is
certainly something having a plausibly affirmative answer, though
depends on the interest of the public at large.

Coordinating Minister for Human Development and Culture of the Republic
of Indonesia Puan Maharani remarked that women in the era of President
Jokowi had the opportunity to don leadership roles, in both the
government and companies.

In the iconic text Built To Last, Jim Collins and Jerry Porras conclude
that companies guided by a purpose beyond simply making money returned
six times more to shareholders than explicitly profit-driven rivals.

More recently, a Harvard Business Review Analytics report titled "The
Business Case for Purpose" found “those companies able to harness the
power of purpose to drive performance and profitability enjoy a distinct
competitive advantage”. I could list a number of other reports that say
the same thing, but I’ll move on. Google it.

Put aside your neutral palette, Gabriella Bennett looks at the trends in

If the catwalk informs what will fill our wardrobes, the equivalent for
the home is the interiors trade show. Whether in Paris, London or
Glasgow, it is where interior designers go to share industry gossip,
suss out the competition and replenish their inspiration inventories.
Bricks & Mortar attended the Scottish Interiors Showcase at the
Macdonald Inchrya Hotel in Polmont this week with the same intention.
Amid the trend-spotting, we asked experts to give us tips for styling
real homes — ones with children, dogs and a budget. Their answers were
rooted in nature, with ties to international art figures and the world

Despite the popularity of Instagram and influencers among millennials,
legacy brands like Cox & Kings, Apollo and Estee Lauder have for the
first time roped in celebrity endorsers

It's the era of digital. But despite an influx of programmatic
advertising, micro-influencers and social media marketing, the good ole
ambassadors still reign supreme for brands.

about making her new film on a tiny budget, #MeToo, and the chances of
more 'Sex and the City"I remember being poor. We didn't have electricity'

Sarah Jessica Parker played Carrie Bradshaw for so long, it can be hard
to remember that she had a whole life before Sex and the City won her
two Emmys, four Golden Globes and spawned two movies. From Footloose and
The First Wives Club to Tim Burton's Ed Wood and Mars Attacks!, Parker's
pre-Carrie career was eclectic - and she was never afraid to go
down-and-dirty.

Joan Collins dishes about Hollywood legends in her West End show.

LONDON---We would often rush to the hottest plays or brand-new musicals
every time we're in Europe's top theater hub. For the first night of our
European break, however, we decided to let our feet take us off the
beaten track and spend one "provocative" evening with glamorous Dame
Joan Collins, looking gloriously half her age at 85, at the 108-year-old
London Palladium.

New Delhi, Feb. 22 -- The cover of the current edition of The Economist
depicts the rise of "*millennial* socialism". It is about the preference
for socialism among children born around the birth of the new millennium
and now stepping into adulthood. Who could have thought that, less than
three decades after the triumph of capitalism and globalization, The
Economist will have such a cover and will be carrying a lead article on
the topic of the resurgence of socialism? The end of communism, the
collapse of the Berlin Wall and the disintegration of the Soviet Union
were supposed to have ended history. This demonstrates, yet again, how
remarkably difficult it is for humans to predict the future. But, as
Will and Ariel Durant write in their book, The Lessons Of History, the
first lesson of history is humility. The second lesson is that western
experts are more likely to get their predictions wrong because of their
linear view of the world.

In my vocabulary, yarn has always been a verb -- it's the act of having
a conversation. My aunty is, in my dad’s words, “always on for a yarn”.
The last time I was home in regional Victoria, I ended up talking with
the old bloke who owns the town’s carwash and, as I left, he called out
“thanks for the yarn! Get home safe!”

But, in recent years, it's felt like every time I jump online and read a
new story, article, breaking news item, profile, literally any type of
digital media piece, I'm confronted with invitations from every media
producer from Bondi to Fitzroy to please read their "yarn". I cringe
every time.

Australia, Indonesia and Switzerland boards pitch offbeat experiences
and places, hope to tap into *millennial* wanderlust

Draw your eye down some of the recent ads for visiting Australia, or
Indonesia or even Switzerland and what you will miss are the tried and
tested itineraries. Beyond the usual imagery of the Sydney harbour, or
Bali beaches and the Alps, the tourism boards of these countries are
promoting places and experiences that Indian tourists have stayed away
from in the past. The objective is to get the attention of the affluent
and *millennial* traveller.

Retiring boomers can expect to be mugged by reality — and ingratitude In
2001 I published my first book, The Big Shift, which included a thought
piece I had published some years earlier. Here’s what I wrote 20 years
ago: “Greedy Boomers Bleed Xers. So runs the headline … in 2021. The
story proceeds, ‘The Australian president today launched a stinging
attack on the now-retiring baby boom generation for what she calls its
bleeding of the taxpayer after a life of self-indulgent spending. We,
the X generation, are now being asked to support a bunch of bludgers,’
the president said.” As you can see my taste for satire, which peaked
with the smashed avocado brouhaha of 2016, was evident early in my
writing. Plus, it’s nice to see that the term “bludgers” remains as
relevant and as piquant today as it was back then. And we may not have a
president today, but we have had a female prime minister, so I’m
claiming this entire piece as a prediction proven.

International visitor spending hit $11.1 billion last year with
spectacular growth from the Chinese, highlighting New Zealand's
dependence on that market.

Total spending by international visitors rose 6 per cent in the year to
December, and the contribution from China was up 14 per cent to $1.68b,
making it second only to Australia.

American Giant makes all its clothing in the US. Could its success be a
model?

Bayard Winthrop is angry. “Washington DC is just completely full of
shit,” he tells me, recalling a meeting he had last year in the US
capital with a group of senior politicians who wanted to understand how
they could bring manufacturing back to America’s heartland.

*HD* 	Report: Bright spots in Center City housing market but room for
improvement

One of the takeaways from Center City District’s latest annual housing
report was that Philadelphia is doing well — by Philadelphia standards.

When compared with peer cities, Philadelphia is still middling. Middling
in the growth of jobs, incomes, housing prices and reinvestment.
Middling in permits issues. While the increase in residential
construction is “impressive by local standards,” Philadelphia County
ranks 62nd among the 100 largest counties in terms of units permitted
since 2010.

Extremism is on the rise in British politics. There is no longer room
for compromise. You are either with us or you are the enemy, apparently.
Our politics are now unrecognisably unfriendly and hostile by default,
but this is a societal problem. The language of politics is poisonous.

Incendiary headlines have branded judges “enemies of the people” and
politicians “saboteurs”. Civil servants who cannot defend themselves
publicly are denounced by MPs as biased. People are attacked, rather
than their arguments. One member of parliament has been murdered.

From Michael Kent, Azimo, London, UK

Karen Petrou tells us that regulatory sandboxes “are battlefields on
which the big tech companies are taking great risks with our financial
future” and that fintech poses “a real risk not just to regulated
competitors but also to economic equality” (Opinion, February 19).

How did the Democratic Party move so far left so fast? No convention,
retreat or caucus was held to designate Medicare for All, tippy-top tax
rates, arcane identity litmus tests, free college tuition or a Green New
Deal as Democratic dogma, but here we are.

So far every major Democrat who has declared for the presidency --
Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Amy
Klobuchar, Tulsi Gabbard -- has felt obliged at least to genuflect in
the direction of Cardinal Bernie.

Lead-generation firm Televerde puts purpose over profit by employing
hundreds of incarcerated women to make sales calls and improve their lives.

As a lead-generation company, Televerde’s business is obviously very
sales-oriented. CFO Jill Barnard says she works very closely with the
sales organization to tailor the firm’s approach on behalf of specific
customers and to develop a broad menu of pricing options.

The Moxy Hotel in Uptown Oakland will break ground within 60 days,
joining the West Elm Hotel that started construction in January just two
blocks away.

Both hotels are within a few blocks of Uptown Station, the renovated
office property where San Francisco-based Square Inc. recently leased
all 356,000 square feet. Other developers are building housing and
retail in the area.

we just wanted to take a moment to recognize our CAGNY President this

BEVERLY HILLS — Momentum. There’s plenty of it surrounding Zendaya
Coleman, who is set next week to reveal her capsule with Tommy Hilfiger
and was confirmed on Thursday as the newest Lancôme global ambassador.

The singer and actress, who this year is set to star in “Spider-Man: Far
From Home” and HBO and A24’s series “Euphoria,” was tapped to be global
brand ambassador for Hilfiger in a deal unveiled late last year, with
the Tommy x Zendaya capsule to be shown during Paris Fashion Week on
March 2. But before that, Coleman on Thursday evening in Beverly Hills
revealed with Lancôme news of yet another ambassador title.

AT times we catch ourselves asking, 'Is this where we imagined ourselves
to be?' Are we as lucky, happy, wealthy and healthy as we hoped to be?
In a more philosophical questioning: Is there any person who can say
they are content and want nothing more?

Since I was in high school, I always wrote about peace and 'stillness.'
I often considered a calm life as my ultimate goal. It might be because
of our tumultuous family life. It might be because I was afraid of the
feelings of unexpected ups and downs. Whatever it was, I associated
contentment with non-turbulence.

ON-DEMAND digital transport services will continue to help the
Philippine e-commerce industry balloon to a $10-billion industry in the
next half a decade, as they continue to address the last-mile
requirements for transporting goods from one point to another.

The e-commerce industry in the Philippines today-ruled by digital
shopping platforms Lazada, Shopee, Zalora and the like-continues to be
on a roll in terms of growth. In 2018, the industry grew to $1.5
billion, according to data from Temasek, a Singaporean government-owned
corporation.

KATHMANDU, Feb. 21 -- Rap music entered the subcontinent's musical
firmament decades ago, but its essence has never been as well
encapsulated as in the new Bollywood film, Gully Boy, that is in cinemas
in Kathmandu this week.

Right at the outset, protagonist Murad (Ranveer Singh) points out what
contemporary Indian rap sounds like: "What kind of song is this? Look,
this is my car! Look, this is my girl! Look at all this gold I have!"
Yes, those are the rap songs we usually see from the likes of singers
like Yoyo Honey Singh in most Bollywood songs.

How many people does it take to summon the multiple talents,
decades-spanning career and complicated life of Sammy Davis Jr.?

Laurence Maslon, who wrote the 2017 documentary “Sammy Davis, Jr: I’ve
Gotta Be
Me,”[http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/sammy-davis-jr-ive-gotta-be-me-about/10877/]
which had its premiere on PBS’s “American Masters” this week, remembered
coming across a 1968 Mad Magazine satire on racial stereotypes that said
three black individuals could equal an “emerging African nation” — but
it would take four to represent Davis alone.

Contrary to how they’re often portrayed in the media, today’s young
Hispanic population is dynamic, multicultural, heterogeneous and often
multilingual, setting them apart from every other group, minority or
otherwise. Mostly born in the U.S. or at least raised here, their
Spanish and English proficiency crosses the spectrum. They’re Dreamers,
literally and figuratively, optimistic and holding tight to the sorts of
aspirations that go along with that. And they’re already, both directly
and indirectly, influencing your kids, from mainstream entertainment to
original YouTube content. Social media and influencer landscapes are
teeming with them.

2019 appears to be the year that 5G transitions from buzzword to reality
and the Middle East looks like the ideal market for this technology.

But according to our latest research, SuperServe: Five Strategies for
Superior Customer Service, it would be a mistake to assume that new
technology, on its own, is enough to win over Middle Eastern consumers.
While our report indicates a hunger for new technologies among Middle
Eastern consumers, it also shows a clear demand for excellent customer
service.

The world knows Timothy Wilcots for rhinestone encrusted gowns, big hair
and an infectious laugh. He's also an ex-felon.

Wilcots was released from prison in 2007 after being charged with
possession of illegal substances and violating his parole. A small
mistake that's no secret to his followers, but which largely shapes the
platform for his drag persona of Latrice Royale.

Our region has a major challenge incorporating millennials into our
economy. True, we have our share of the young techie crowd creating new
businesses in a local Silicon Valley ecosystem that will soon include
Amazon HQ2. But for most of this region’s young adults, launching a
disruptive startup isn’t in the cards. Because they see no option, many
millennials are seeking or working at jobs that hold little interest or
offer minimal future.

Not surprisingly, a survey done by Harvard University recently showed 51
percent of young adults 18 to 29 don’t support capitalism. Yet this is
the cohort that our region depends on for the future. According to the
Pew Research Center, millennials are literally the largest age cohort in
the region and nation.

There is a video and various infographics circulating on the Internet
that share surprising success stories: Netflix (1997) bankrupted almost
all video stores; Booking (1996) is in jeopardy to tourism companies;
Google (1998) disabled the yellow pages; Airbnb (2008) is threatening
the hotel sector, while WhatsApp (2009) does the same with fixed and
cellular telephony operators. Social networks (Facebook 2004, Twitter
2006) have strongly shaken the media and Uber (2009) taxi drivers,
Alibaba (1999) and Amazon (1994) are the fear of retail and even large
departmental companies.

By now, the demographic story of the 2016 election is familiar to the
point of exhaustion. Donald Trump, through a combination of populist
economics, cultural conservatism, "law and order" and a hard-line
immigration policy, lost some traditionally Republican suburbanites but
won enough formerly Democratic blue-collar white voters to get an
electoral college majority and become president. Trump's blue-collar
strength shocked plenty of people who collectively repented by reading
"Hillbilly Elegy," sending boatloads of reporters on expeditions to
Youngstown, Ohio, and trying to see literally every political story from
the vantage point of a white, middle-aged central Pennsylvania man who
voted for Barack Obama twice but now wears a MAGA hat because he lost
his job in the steel plant.

The Alfred Dunhill brand can trace its roots all the way back to 1893
but its presence in the U.S. market over the years has been spotty at best.

In the Fifties, the London-based brand operated major stores on Rodeo
Drive in Los Angeles and Rockefeller Center in New York and counted
celebrities such as Frank Sinatra as fans.

When implemented correctly, Facebook ads can be an ROI juggernaut. And
placing your ads correctly is crucial for creating campaigns that
convert. To get the best results for the lowest possible cost, it's
important to understand how Facebook's algorithm optimizes.

Facebook constantly innovates and updates its algorithm to give both
publishers and users a great experience. And Facebook's algorithm wants
you to do well. When your campaign succeeds, Facebook earns more
revenue. Opting into as many placements as possible maximizes your ad's
performance and ensures your users receive relevant ads at the right time.

Mr. Jollof

A Nigerian comic is making an unlikely bid for election to parliament,
combining a strong social media presence with a campaign almost entirely
in Pidgin to win young followers.

SALEM, Ore. — Oregon Gov. Kate Brown on Thursday touted the success of
the state's unique automatic voter registration program, pointing to a
new report that argues the "Oregon model" could be key to engaging
*millennial* voters nationwide.

The study by the non-profit Center for American Progress found that
voter registration numbers among youths have soared since Oregon
switched to an automatic registration model in 2016. The law registers
eligible voters when they apply for a driver's license.

Among the many industries facing their own workforce challenges, local
health care institutions are using innovative methods to strengthen
their industry's pipeline.

Workforce initiatives were one of many topics discussed at the Dayton

Amazon’s decision to pull one of its much-ballyhooed HQ2 projects out of
New York City quickly became the most-discussed business story of the
young new year.

Down here in Philadelphia and across the other “finalist” locations,
excitement began to rise. Might Mr. Bezos choose to take that project
and its promised 25,000 jobs to another location? Such hope was quickly
squashed when Amazon said it would move forward with its plans for a
full HQ2 in Northern Virginia and a 5,000-job hub in Nashville, but it
would scatter those planned New York City jobs “across our 17 corporate
offices and tech hubs in the U.S. and Canada.”

For some it's Barney, or the colour of a Prince song. In Canadian real
estate, it's the sign of disruption.

Purple Bricks lawn signs started popping up on properties for sale in
Hamilton last summer shortly after Britain's Purplebricks Group
purchased Quebec's low-cost real estate leader DuProprio. As part of the
$51 million takeover, signs for Comfree (the DuProprio division in
Ontario, Manitoba and Alberta) were replaced with the new purple branding.

MUMBAI: Hip-hop artist Hard Kaur will be coming out with her new single
called Poison. Finally, the wait is over and we would get to hear Hard
Kaur's magical voice in her recent track. "I am elated, proud and just
happy for this song. This is truly a celebration of freedom. India is
changing and has made some strong and much-needed decisions for ensuring
equality and here's to that. We are all equal irrespective of our
backgrounds, caste or colour. And it's a very proud thing for me. This
is the song to celebrate what's amongst us."

Poison is a song that explores the world of freedom. It is about freedom
of expression, self-belief, physicality and above all, the freedom to be
who you are. Hard Kaur has been a movement in the world of music on her
own, and with Poison, she has raised the benchmark of music and
performance while resonating in equal parts with various sections of
society, be it the gen-next, LGBTQ community, *millennial* and everyone
who believes in independence.
