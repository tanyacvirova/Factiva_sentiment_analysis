Never did this blog make so much sense or ever its title more in line
with reality. I write from Madrid and the servant creatures, two units
in concrete and both in Primary, have already been without school for
eight days. Add seven house arrests, which is what I call the eastern
confinement issue.

At the moment, we still remember our names, but I've already started to
mess around. Sometimes I confuse them, the eldest with the little one
and vice versa, although in truth, the sloping of my memory is of little
importance because they have not attended to any vocative for days. I
can already put on a hydra that they have become accustomed to my
irritated tone and find it inaudible. I take flicker, out of courtesy,
although I think I will soon resort to pharmacology. The infusions
always seemed to me of comeflores, with forgiveness, and chemistry, as
long as it is legal, wide is Castile...

As the coronavirus spread from China to other parts of the world,
millennials shrugged their shoulders at the advice of public health
authorities and continued to spill out of bars, restaurants, gleefully
tweet about cheap vacation airfare and plan get-togethers.

However, new evidence from Europe and the U.S. suggests that younger
adults aren't as impervious to the novel coronavirus that's circulating
worldwide as originally thought.

New Delhi, March 20 -- At the outset, I want to say that my parents have
now calmed down.

Last Sunday, however, not only did they attend a child's birthday party
in Mumbai (who are these people throwing birthday parties!) but also a
dinner party. The latter was a consolation party to make up for the fact
that the annual performance of a music and dance school they patronize
had to cancel its function because of, you know, the ongoing global
health crisis.

The trend of nurturing succulents is gaining popularity, thanks to their
easy-tohandle nature. And green décor enthusiasts, especially
millennials, are pursuing it as a hobby

Surabhi Kamat was in a fix; having worked late over the week to complete
a project, she had to put in time on the weekend too and had barely
spent time at home. An avid gardener, Kamat's house was a green room.
But an increasingly hectic work schedule meant less time to tend to her
garden. That's when succulents caught her fancy. "When on holiday in
Malaysia, I fell in love with the succulents at a nursery and bought a
few all the way back to India. Since then, it has been an art project of
sorts, and an alternative to satisfy my green thumb itch without having
to worry about neglecting them," says the 27-year-old PR professional
who sports several terrariums as décor pieces to brighten up her home.

Despite early reassurances that young people weren’t likely at risk of
getting seriously ill or dying due to COVID-19, a new report on virus
cases in the United States has found that young adults are not “immune”
to the dangers of the disease.

The study, conducted by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC)[https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6912e2.htm?s_cid=mm6912e2_w#F1_down],
was based on 2,500 of the first recorded cases in America and found that
adults of all ages are being seriously sickened by the coronavirus.

Welcome to the column where you provide the content. Nick Cater
suggested coronavirus would provide an unprecedented test of resilience
for
Millennials[https://www.theaustralian.com.au/commentary/coronavirus-shockwave-a-generational-test-of-resilience/news-story/221a38adfd729890fe8f44bf0f417acb],
who have never experienced an economic downturn and have been wrapped in
cotton wool by their well-intentioned parents. A failed test, according
to Terryd:

“Resilience? Most Australians under 40 would never have heard of the
word and will never have been taught it in school so good luck with that
one. A family member told my wife yesterday their *Millennial* son,
still at home at 26 of course, was complaining that the toilet paper she
had at home was not 3 ply.”

brother on his birthday to being trolled for her performance in 'Love
Aaj Kal’, Sara has braved it all. Her recent Varanasi video amid
Coronavirus outbreak irked her followers who asked her to wear a mask if

Alia Bhatt is currently the most sought after actress in Bollywood and
has four films lined up for release in 2020. Each one of them sees the
*millennial* actress in a versatile role. However, due to the outbreak
of Coronavirus the shootings of the films and TV shows have been stalled
for a few weeks. Alia's schedule has gone out of order and therefore
there are reports that the actress might have to opt-out of SS
Rajamouli’s 'RRR'.Reportedly, the 'Gully Boy' actress was supposed to
shoot for the South film in the next few weeks. However, now that the
shooting schedules are postponed, the actress has to manage her dates of
'RRR' along with those for Karan Johar’s 'Takht' and also the final
parts of Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s 'Gangubai Kathiawadi'. Hence Alia might
have to walk out of the project, as it’s a small role. However,
contrasting to this, another report in a daily stated that Alia is very
much part of the project and will soon start shooting in May.

Human resources departments try on some new perks: meditation, sound
baths, energy consulting and hypnotherapy.

On a rainy Thursday afternoon, in a plush pink conference room in
Manhattan, a group of colleagues formed a meditation circle. As they sat
in their own silence, sirens and traffic wailed below. “Bathe in the joy
of truly loving yourself,” a former Tibetan Buddhist monk advised them.

Deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly announced the new restrictions
after people unnecessarily stockpiled the crucial medications in a

Last month, Wuhan was overwhelmed with thousands of new cases of
coronavirus each day, but in a dramatic development that underscores
just how much the outbreak has pivoted toward Europe and the United
States, Chinese authorities said that the city and its surrounding
province had no new cases to report.

The news offers a rare glimmer of hope for the rest of the world as it
battles the virus, and perhaps a lesson in the strict measures needed to
halt its spread.

Operators fear power will permanently tilt further towards streaming as
customers spend enforced time at home

On Friday night Cody Clarke was delivering popcorn and avocado toasts to
audience members at a showing of Emma, the recent Jane Austen film
adaptation, when he noticed something strange: the screen was dark.
dwindling as nerves rose over the coronavirus outbreak. He returned to
the kitchen where a manager told employees that the indie cinema chain
was shutting down indefinitely.

When Dr. Walter R. Allen takes on a research project, there must always
be a larger purpose - something he discusses with graduate students and
young academics. According to Allen, African American scholars cannot
live in an ivory tower. All research - including his more than 150
publications - must, in some way, illuminate the challenges that
communities of color face.

Throughout his career, Allen, a sociologist, has studied comparative
race, ethnicity and inequality. While his home base is the University of
California, Los Angeles, where he is distinguished professor of
sociology and the Allan Murray Carter professor of higher education,
Allen's influence stretches throughout higher education. There is his
research on HBCUs, his testimony on cases to advance equity in higher
education, his unwavering commitment to building future generations of
scholars and his active interest in global issues.

It's not just adults 65 and older. Americans of all ages have faced
serious health complications amid the new coronavirus outbreak, a
federal health report says.

New data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that
among the roughly 12% of COVID-19 cases in the U. S. known to need
hospitalizations, about 1 in 5 were among people ages 20 to 44.

Shares in Afterpay slid another 22 per cent on Thursday, defying efforts
by chief executive Anthony Eisen to reassure investors that the buy now,
pay later group's business model can withstand a coronavirus-induced
downturn.

Mr Eisen wrote in a two-page letter to investors that Afterpay is yet to
see any impact on its business and is well positioned to weather the
"unprecedented environment".

After immigrating to the United States from Bangladesh, Mynul Khan was
inspired by the strength of the Minnesota business community, and in
particular, its support of entrepreneurs. At the same time, he noticed
how the 2008 recession impacted the way people work, with many
professionals turning to independent contractor arrangements that
allowed more flexibility.

Those threads came together as Field Nation, an online work marketplace
that connects businesses with highly skilled freelancing technicians in
numerous specialties from high-voltage electricians to qualified kiosk
installers. As founder and CEO, the 38-year-old Khan is changing the
landscape for on-site contingent workers and the companies that rely on
them. He bootstrapped the company's growth from 2008 to 2015, then
raised a $30 million round.

<th>R epresentative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii has finally come to a
realization that Democratic voters had long since had on their own: She
is not going to be the next president of the United States.

The idiosyncratic congresswoman officially ended her campaign this
morning, having earned a pair of delegates from American Samoa but never
capturing real momentum in the race. The bigger news from her
announcement was that she would endorse former Vice President Joe Biden,
the delegate leader in the primary and likely nominee. That nod removes
a fear among Democrats that Gabbard might mount a third-party run and
siphon off crucial votes from Biden in a close election.

JoJo is entertaining us all with a reworking of her 2000 hit ‘Leave (Get
Out)’ & reminding us to stay inside!

As we remained quarantined due to the Coronavirus outbreak, JoJo is
helping spread the message of ‘flattening the curve’ and staying inside
by rewriting her famous jam “Leave (Get Out)” from 2000! Aimed at her
*millennial* audience, many of whom have ignored orders to stay inside
amid the Coronavirus outbreak, JoJo urged fans to “not be dumb” and
self-isolate. “I’ve been chillin’ at home the last few days / So you
gotta FaceTime and talk to me / To tell me how we’re gonna get through
this together,” JoJo sings in the reworked hit titled “Chill (Stay In).”
“Stay in / Right now / Do it for humanity! / I’m dead-ass about that,
but we will survive / So you gon’ learn how to cook now and practice
good hygiene / I know you’re bored and want to f*ck around, but not on
me.” It’s an absolute banger!

Soma Tah Rajendran Dandapani, Director of Zoho University tells how the
collaboration tools that promote flat hierarchies, frictionless sharing
of vision and roadmaps, and flexible always-connected environments that
promote remote work and agile interactions will be the most wanted.
Excerpt:  Geography will soon be history  
Collaboration[https://www.pcquest.com/collaboration-time-corona/] is
needed only because no man is an island, and people come to the office
on the single premise that what two people couldn’t do sitting at their
respective desks at home can be done better faster and cheaper when they
come together at the office. Intelligent immersive tools will eventually
overcome these limitations. Instead of the best local talent coming to
your office, your office will ‘travel’ to the global best talent.
Telepresence and live smart collaboration may even prove a boon when
pandemic threats like the Corona virus happen.

Millennials may just have the opportunity to rebrand what it means to be
American, as did many of their predecessors, including the "Greatest

Sure, there's plenty of blame to go around for the scary state of
affairs regarding the novel
coronavirus[https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-03-18-20-intl-hnk/],
especially when it comes to the American government: Why weren't we

Sasha Plavsic is pretty clear that she picked the right beauty category
to start a business in. “The clean category, as they’re calling it now,
is on an extreme growth pattern,” Plavsic said on the Glossy Beauty
Podcast, calling it “one of the fastest categories in Sephora, if not
the market in general.”

Financial planner David Field wants to help people who are approaching
retirement or already retired and worried about their finances. And why
wouldn’t they worry? Stock markets have plunged in recent weeks, and
interest rates are falling. On top of that, there’s an expectation of a
recession to come.

Mr. Field, a certified financial planner (CFP) with Papyrus Planning,
has come up with a list of six ways to reduce your financial anxiety
about retirement:

I am 34 years old and born in the new Argentine democracy. I am a
faithful exponent of the characteristics of a *millennial* (several jobs
not to get bored, social and environmental awareness, hyperconnected and
informed) and like all of us who inhabit the national territory, this is
the first traumatic fact that I am confronting the whole of society in

Comedy Central is hitting Snapchat with its first scripted original
series: “Get Money,” a mock how-to explaining how to make it in the gig
economy.

The timing is less than ideal. Numerous “gig economy” workers across
sectors have been hard hit by the economic impact of the coronavirus
pandemic, so the humor may fall flat. That said, “Get Money” doesn’t
make fun of freelancers or the gig economy per se: The central joke is
that the clueless *millennial* main character has no business teaching
anyone anything.

According to Donald Trump's latest theory, millennials are to blame for
the spread of the coronavirus. But as DW's Joel Dullroy argues, it's
precisely that generation which is making sacrifices for today's baby
boomers.

The only welcome victim of coronavirus will be the myth of the 'entitled
*millennial*.' Let us hear no more accusations of individualism,
selfishness and over-avocado-eating from older generations. Many baby
boomers now owe their lives to the selflessness of the young.

The federal government is preparing for the possibility the coronavirus
pandemic could last up to 18 months or longer and "include multiple
waves of illness," a report obtained by CNN
shows[https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/18/politics/contingency-planning-18-months-coronavirus/index.html],
as the number of the cases in the US surpassed 10,000.

While the document does not say the Trump administration believes the
pandemic will last that long, it indicates officials have to assume a
longer timeline to ensure preparedness.

sourced beans, top-drawer machinery and attractive décor, these
hotel-run coffee shops make for far more inspiring spots to lounge, get

In October, TikTok
href=”https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/15/tiktok-taps-corporate-law-firm-kl-gates-to-advise-on-its-u-s-content-moderation-policies/[https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/15/tiktok-taps-corporate-law-firm-kl-gates-to-advise-on-its-u-s-content-moderation-policies/]”>
tapped corporate law firm K&L Gates to advise the company on its
moderation policies and other topics afflicting social media platforms.
As a part of those efforts, TikTok said it would form a new committee of
experts to advise the business on topics like child safety, hate speech,
misinformation, bullying and other potential problems. Today, TikTok is
announcing the technology and safety experts who will be the company’s
first committee members.

The committee, known as the TikTok Content Advisory Council, will be
chaired by Dawn Nunziato, a professor at George Washington University
Law School and co-director of the Global Internet Freedom Project.
Nunziato specializes in free speech issues and content regulation —
areas where TikTok has fallen short.

"right

the coronavirus task force, making her one of the most visible medical
officials in the country.

But in 2003, Birx, an HIV researcher, was trying to get the attention of
the official helming the global AIDS response -- by standing outside of
his house for a week.

Yesterday I had some repercussions with my note and some criticism from
friends. They interpreted lightly that my judgment promoted a communist
ideology.

This word should not frighten us and analyse – in the immediate future –
more communal and solidarity forms and behaviors and increasingly far
from "ideologies".

Driven by digital transformation, all businesses now run their customer
experience inside and out using digital products. Businesses are
competing in a new way, with faster-moving, more agile competitors,
harnessing digital technologies to delight their customers and beat
their competitors. And this is not just online retail; it’s
telecommunications, healthcare, financial services – almost every
industry. Even more traditional businesses have harnessed new business
models to effectively become digital products, competing to provide an
amazing customer experience. Continuously tuning that digital experience
is the new business battleground, and new techniques are being employed
to test, monitor and continuously improve the digital experience and
thus, the business outcomes.

The office sector has also undergone a transformation over the past few
decades, but there's scope to do more.

Today, internet-powered tools are an integral part of our day-to-day
lives; we turn to technology when we need to book holiday accommodation,
get a taxi, find and make reservations at a good restaurant or find out
when the next bus is due. New technology makes our lives easier and
provides us with the kind of flexibility and variety of options our
grandparents couldn’t have dreamed of.

“Despite improvements in social parameters, India’s growth does not
translate into the economic inclusion and development of women,” reads a
report by Google and Bain & Company released in February 2020. While it
is a discouraging revelation, it also points out that women’s
entrepreneurship can help advance the cause of financial inclusion of
women in the country.

Fuelling entrepreneurial spirit and providing necessary support to women
entrepreneurs hold the promise of changing the economic and social
trajectory of India and its women for generations to come.

Blue might be the colour of the year in 2020, but green remains a
perennial decorating favourite. Green, in all its glorious variations,
is one of the most-seen colours in nature and that makes it easier to
work with when decorating. Just look to the natural world for
inspiration on the many shades of green and how to use them in your decor.

In the dessert, for instance, greens tend to be cooler grey-based; in
lush, tropical climates, green has a warmer, yellow base. This year, the
tone of green that's popular is a cooler, greyer green, best described
as olive or aloe green.

Before shutdowns swept the globe and many were urged -- or mandated --

A specialist in public health communications, the 31-year-old encouraged
her *millennial* peers to steer clear of bars and parties -- but says
"friends would think I was overreacting."

themselves. Grandparents who reckon it is surely fine to still pop to
the local shop for the paper. Friends who insist that a quiet trip to
the pub won’t do any harm. A dentist check-up, a Sunday lunch, going
round to a friend’s house: it’s small, of course it will be okay.

More people could fall prey to online sex abuse and trolling as working
from home becomes the norm during the coronavirus outbreak, and more
video conferencing takes place, women's rights experts warned on Wednesday.

The world is in "new and uncharted territory" with so many people
suddenly working remotely, which gives abusers new ways to target both
strangers and acquaintances online, said Heather Barr, co-director of
women's rights at Human Rights Watch.

Kate Mulvey was a happy singleton - before the pandemic. Now, she's
trying everything to find a man she can self-isolate with

To find yourself single and unmarried in midlife is bad enough, but to
be on your own in the time of Covid-19 creates a new kind of
predicament. As a trip to the shops becomes a high-stakes activity, and
each day brings more frightening news, while my married and couple
friends have started battening down the hatches and cocooning themselves
with pasta and Netflix. Overnight, my life as a happy-go-lucky solo has
dwindled to well, zero, as the friends on whom I rely for companionship
have disappeared. The only communications I get now are cheery "Don't
worry, Kate, we're all in this together!' messages. Only, we're not.

WASHINGTON -- The White House considered issuing an executive order
greatly expanding the use of investigational drugs against the new
coronavirus, but it met with objections from Food and Drug
Administration scientists who warned it could pose unneeded risks to
patients, according to a senior government official.

The idea to expand testing of drugs and other medical therapies was
strongly opposed by the FDA's senior scientists this week, the official
said, and represented the most notable conflict between the FDA and the
White House in recent memory.

New C.D.C. data shows that nearly 40 percent of patients sick enough to
be hospitalized were age 20 to 54. But the risk of dying was

American adults of all ages — not just those in their 70s, 80s and 90s —
are being seriously sickened by the
coronavirus[https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-body-symptoms.html],
according to a report on nearly 2,500 of the first recorded cases in the
