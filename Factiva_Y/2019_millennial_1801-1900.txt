Have you ever looked at your Google search history? It's a
remarkable/embarrassing catalogue of all of the random things that
popped into your head for which you were either unable or unwilling to
get more information independently.

This also holds true, of course, for politics. If you are curious about
the presidential candidacy of, say, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.),
you are not going to trudge up to the address bar in your browser and
try random dot-com-binations of "gillibrand," "2020" and "foramerica"
like some cave man from the 1990s. You're going to go to Google and
you're going to type "kirstne gilliubrand" or whatever is fastest, and
Google's going to guide you to your destination like a kindergarten
teacher on the first day of school.

There are few investors who deliver solid results year after year. Hedge
funds often get spectacular results, then crash and burn. No wonder,
then, that the world's most successful investor Warren Buffett's annual
letter[http://berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2018ltr.pdf] to Berkshire
Hathaway shareholders always makes fascinating reading.

For 54 years, Berkshire Hathaway's per share market value return has
posted a compounded annual gain of 20.5 per cent, more than double that
of S&P 500 shares (with dividends included). In 2018, when global
markets took a beating and the S&P 500 lost 4.4 per cent, Berkshire
returned 2.8 per cent.

Internet ON, a service that uses three technologies to serve its
customers - satellite, fixed wireless and wired, began operating in
September last year with Red Compartida, the public-private wholesale
telecommunications project by Altán Redes. In December, it launched its
satellite offer, and it has only been a couple of months on Telmex's
fiber optic and copper networks. Lorenzo Orozco, director of the firm,
tells his plans. EXPANSION: How did the idea of providing an internet
service in Dish come about? LORENZO OROZCO: Ten years ago, when they
said that pay television would only reach 12 million customers, Dish
brought the service with coverage to all of Mexico, breaking that
digital entertainment gap. Now we want to do the same with the internet,
it is evolution, we have to enter the internet market because of the
convergence that exists in all services, and now entertainment services
are on that platform.

The wound is opened by the tragic events of December 24, as is
skepticism, which for some is synonymous with suspicion, which makes the
consequences of all kinds, including politics, more harmful.

The absurd response of the SCT to a request for information from
MILENIO, to put it mildly, in the sense of reserving for reasons of
"national security" the audio recordings of the pilot and the tower,
until the end of the sexennium, returned the subject, and Maybe the
anger, all the poblanos.

Release date - 28022019

New research, conducted by the University of Liverpool and University
College London, has found that young people today are more likely to be
depressed and to self-harm than they were 10 years ago, but antisocial
behaviour and substance use - often thought to go hand-in-hand with
mental ill-health - are in decline.

Recreational vehicles are becoming increasingly attractive to younger
crowds seeking to escape the city

From the models on prominent display and the messaging on the floor of
the Toronto RV Show in January, you wouldn't have known that the RV
industry is in the midst of a renaissance. Baby boomers populated the
crowd, at a time when experience-craving young people are truly
propelling recreationalvehicle sales in Canada.

by gamers and other users, ahead of a full rollout that has now been
scheduled for within the first six months of 2019.

New Delhi, March 1 -- Time is really the ultimate luxury," said
Shivajirao Gaekwar, deputy director of Sotheby's Auction India, at the
Global Luxury Realty Conclave (GLRC) 2019, a two-day conference (22-23
February) of luxury realty developers, stakeholders in luxury industries
and high net worth individuals, organized by Sotheby's International
Realty in Delhi. "You need enough time to see art, you need enough time
to think about what you're going to buy," he added.

Leisure has always been crucial to luxury pursuits, but globalization
and amplified connectivity make time more valuable than ever before.
Gaekwar brought up time as luxury in the context of collecting art. Yet
the meaning and impact of luxury in a new world became a recurrent point
of discussion across sessions.

MOVE OVER, MILLENNIALS, THERE'S A NEW KID looming on the legal beat.

Seemingly born with smartphones in hand, Generation Z is a generation of
digital natives. Its members grew up alongside the internet, and
technology has been a part of their lives from the very beginning. They
may share some characteristics with their *millennial* counterparts,
including a commitment to social justice, but the next crop of lawyers
will present unique challenges for their future employers. With the
oldest members of Generation Z currently making their way through law
school, life in Big Law is on the horizon. Are law firms ready?

WASHINGTON -- New efforts by President Trump and his staff to question
or undermine the established science of climate change have created a
widening rift between the White House on one side, and scientific facts,
government agencies, and some leading figures in the president's own
party on the other.

The president's senior advisers are exploring the idea of creating a
panel aimed at questioning the National Climate Assessment. According to
a White House memo, the group would include William Happer, a Princeton
physicist who has asserted that carbon dioxide -- a greenhouse gas that
scientists say is trapping heat and warming the planet -- is beneficial
to humanity.

UNMISSABLE ART DOROTHEA TANNING TATE MODERN BY STEVE DINNEEN Strolling
through the Tate Modern's latest show is like revisiting a barely
remembered dream: familiar yet strange, a little frightening. The
retrospective of Dorothea Tanning's 70-year career is a hell of a show,
in more ways than one. It's filled with nightmarish visions, including
an installation in which amorphous creatures slither from a fireplace
and human forms burst through chintzy wallpaper.

Others pieces are merely unsettling, such as Eine Kleine Nachtmusik,
which depicts a pair of young girls - or perhaps dolls - in a hotel
hallway as a giant sunflower scratches menacingly across the ground
towards them. It's all deliciously gothic, Salvador Dali by way of
Daphne du Maurier.

Leaders must focus on upskilling their workforce if they are to retain
employees and lift productivity, by making career development a key part
of the company

It was more than 20 years ago when the chairman of the John Lewis
Partnership at the time called me to his London office. I travelled down
from Manchester, where I was running Cheadle's John Lewis branch. Having
spent my entire career working in department stores, I was bowled over
when he asked me to become Waitrose's first ever marketing director.

OTHERS Helmed by an acerbically witty Rebel Wilson, Isn’t It Romantic
lacks observational details that make for a successful parody A head
injury neatly separates Isn’t It Romantic , the contemporary woke
romantic comedy and the parody. The Netflix film begins by showcasing
Natalie (Rebel Wilson) and her “real and relatable” world and then slips
into a satire which aims to contradict two worlds. In a “normal” New
York *millennial* bubble, Natalie’s problems are driven by her
upbringing, insecurities and embitterment, while the critique of the
romcom universe involves a takedown of various stereotypes: pop culture,
queer, narrative, and aesthetic. But the problem with the film is that
it appears so disconnected from both the worlds that the humour feels
dated, despite being bankrolled by a streaming platform that aspires to
be ahead of the curve.

mentoring students and revisiting ancient educational methods.

On millennials, Dr. Tushar Guha, founder, Open Forum of Principals
stated: “This generation is diverse in the way of their behaviour and
perspective. Thus, it is very important for their mentors to accept
their talent the way they are.”

You may as well call it 50 shades of pink. For, this hue can be seen in
so many variations - baby pink, light *millennial* pink, coral, soft
shell enamel, fuchsia, and more. And at the recent Oscar Awards it was
another shade of the colour that stood out as the most popular fashion
trend for the night - bright pink! There was almost a sea of gowns in
the hue - in poufy frills, netted ruffles, princess-style trail gowns,
bubble-gum hued tulles and more. It's being described by fashion
analysts as 'joyful' and 'what modern couture should be like'. As it
upped the sartorial ante, it got fashion pundits asking: Is pink the new
black?The attention-grabbing pink dresses were seen on a bunch of stars.
'Crazy Rich Asians' star Gemma Chan wore a voluminous gown in magenta.
She also snuck a cookie into her pockets to probably munch on during the
whole event.

New Delhi, March 1 -- Online homestay company Airbnb Inc. sees a huge
growth potential in India on the back of a rising middle class and
*millennial* travel buffs, shifting its focus to domestic travel in a
"compelling" country. "Millennials are our real target audience," Nathan
Blecharczyk, co-founder and chief strategy officer, Airbnb, said in an
interview. "That's what we see across the world as well. India is
compelling," Blecharczyk said. So far, Airbnb has received 1.8 million
guests across its platform in India. Globally, Airbnb expects that by
the end of the first quarter of 2019, there will have been over 500
million guest arrivals in its listings since 2008, when the company was
founded. The company launched its platform in India in May 2016 and has
45,000 listings. "(India has) a substantial base. It's still small
relative to the overall opportunity. But our awareness in India is much
higher than it was few years ago.

Employee engagement has become a mainstream concept throughout
organizations, including corporate boardrooms. The rise of digital
transformation as a strategy and the emergence of the *millennial*
generations gave it much prominence in the recent years.

But the first use of the term occurred in a 1990 Academy of Management
Journal article of William A. Kahn about the psychological conditions of
personal engagement and disengagement at work which examined the
conditions at work that contribute to engagement and disengagement. His
finding showed that the individual and contextual sources of
meaningfulness, safety, and availability had a significant impact on
engagement.

"Shadow 6000 avocado toast" sneakers are gaining much attention as the
*millennial* generations in the U.S. are fanatic about it. The concept
of the sneakers is a toast with avocados on top, by aiming the fact that
the youths are very much interested in healthy food.

The top of the sneaker is colored with light green like an avocado and
the bottom part is brown like a toast. Many red dots, which projects red
peppers frequently sprinkled on top of avocado toasts, are also seen,
while "saucamole" is written on the back of the sneaker. There is even a
commercial that says 'let's go and have a healthy brunch wearing
'avocado toast' sneakers.'

A dark indie film shows in the city today and its audience gets to
decide how it plays out via a digital ballot

Have you sat up while watching a movie, desperate to tell the leading
lady that the hero is in love with her too? Or wanted to step into a
scene to sort out a dilemma? Or wanted the film's climax to play out
differently? If you've watched the episode titled Bandersnatch on the
popular Netflix series, Black Mirror, and wished it were an interactive
film instead of a video game that was adapted into a dark fantasy,
you're hours away from the wish fulfilment.

PARIS — Fourth time lucky?

Lanvin, one-time fairy tale of French fashion, has flipped and flopped
(more often flopped) so many times since Alber Elbaz, the creative
director who gave it modern meaning, was fired in 2015, that it has lost
almost all identity: going romantically cool under Bouchra
Jarrar[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/29/fashion/paris-fashion-week-lanvin-jarrar-maison-margiela-galliano.html];
weirdly 1980s under Olivier
Lapidus[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/fashion/lanvin-paris-fashion-week.html];
and then silent while a new
owner,[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/22/business/fosun-lanvin.html]
management team and designer — Bruno
Sialelli[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/fashion/lanvin-bruno-sialelli-paris.html],
an unknown barely into his 30s — got settled.

In the serene, sunlight-filled waiting room of California Fertility
Partners in Los Angeles—one of the world's leading practitioners of
in-vitro fertilization (IVF)—some 20 people are seated on blue velvet
chairs. Two men, clearly a couple, coo over a pink-cheeked baby girl who
is triumphantly waving a stuffed duck. A 40-something blonde woman in
black workout clothes punctuated by diamonds sits across from a slightly
tense couple conferring in Mandarin. Behind me, I hear a conversation in
French; in another corner, a trio of women—perhaps the employees one
hears about from companies such as Apple and Google who come here in
groups to freeze their eggs, a perk that is generously subsidized by
their employers—quietly laugh. More and more, this scene is being
repeated all over Los Angeles.

When Baptiste Bouygues was looking for a partner for his first fragrance
venture, he did something a lot of us would run away from, screaming:
The 30-year-old called his mother. “I went to see Maman, and I told her
I had this creative dream,” Bouygues explains, recalling how he sold
Marie-Lise Jonak on the big idea: What if they could build a luxury
perfume maison on fine craftsmanship and sustainable production
practices, a line that relied solely on pure, unadulterated materials?
And what if they offered this olfactory triumph in heartbreakingly
beautiful recycled packaging, worthy of a museum vitrine?

With no job and only 119 Instagram followers to her name, 29-year-old
June Bloom hops into a chauffeured SUV bound for the country compound of
her former boss, late-night comedy legend Hugo Best in Erin Somers's
zippy debut Stay Up with Hugo Best (Scribner). June's quick wit keeps
the banter flowing over a bizarre Memorial Day weekend during which the
larger-than-life figure reconciles himself to the cancellation of his
show. The *millennial* and the magnetic celebrity are surprisingly well
suited, two sardonic souls who find themselves connecting. “A crazed
billionaire lurked in all of us, ready to have the lawn mowed on the
hour,” June realizes midway through her stay. The ending doesn't quite
live up to the book's magnificent opening, but it's a devilishly fun
ride along the way.

* Tree lines are supposed to react sensitively to the current global
change. However, the lack of a long‐term (*millennial*) perspective on
tree line shifts in the Pyrenees prevents understanding the underlying
ecosystem dynamics and processes.

* We combine multiproxy palaeoecological analyses (fossil pollen,
spores, conifer stomata, plant macrofossils, and ordination) from an
outstanding ice cave deposit located in the alpine belt c. 200 m above
current tree line (Armeña‐A294 Ice Cave, 2,238 m a.s.l.), to assess for
the first time in the Pyrenees, tree line dynamics, and ecosystem
resilience to climate changes 5,700–2,200 (cal.) years ago.

*HD* 	OLD GUNS NEW GENERATION? YOUNGER DOESN'T ALWAYS MEAN UNINTERESTED.

At the age of 34, I don't consider myself particularly young anymore,
but to the best of my knowledge it does make me one of the younger
contributors around these parts. It also makes me a
*millennial*--technically. As word has it, your average *millennial* is
characterized--often fairly--as a self-entitled, self-absorbed,
gun-phobic hyper-liberal with no interest in or awareness of history.
For this reason, I try to be as good a brand ambassador for my
generation as I can be.

About a month ago, I brought home a Steyr-Hahn model 1912. It fit in
well with the rest of my gun collection, which I'd estimate would have
an average birth date of 1965 if you lumped them all together. As I was
oohing and ahhing over the Steyr's mechanical simplicity, its precise
Austrian machining, and its unmistakable design, I had a small
out-of-body experience. Was it just me who cared about a bygone era of
firearms in this generation of striker-fired, plastic pistols?

The light flashed green at the busy San Francisco intersection as Cody
Wilson joined the backpack-toting crowd walking to work. Just then, his
cellphone rang. A representative from Bank of America, his bank, was
calling to get his opinion on its Merrill Edge trading platform.

Wilson, a 31-year-old customer success manager at a data startup, gave
the rep an earful. The platform was neither as much fun nor as simple to
use as the *millennial*-focused trading app Robinhood, he said. Nor did
the bank’s app have an easy way to invest in low-cost mutual funds; much
of its fare instead was Merrill Edge Select Funds.

Jew hatred has re-entered the European mainstream. It makes an
irrefutable case for the need for a Jewish homeland.

LONDON — Europe’s gathering Jewish question came into sharp focus this
month[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/world/europe/uk-labour-party.html]
when a British M.P. declared that she had come to the “sickening
conclusion” that one of the country’s two main political parties,
Labour, is now “institutionally anti-Semitic.”

A boom in the fashion retail segment in shopping malls in India can be
attributed to a number of reasons including an increase in the number of
brands in the premium fashion category, the entry of global brands and
fast fashion retailers, and the subsequent growing demand for quality
Grade A retail real estate space. We bring an in-depth analysis of why
fashion is the number one category in shopping malls pan India

Indian consumers have a deep-rooted association with fashion and luxury.
According to Euro monitor International, the sale of luxury goods in
India grew 25 percent in 2014 in comparison to China and Indian
consumers have never looked back since then. Fashion, which comprises
the major portion of the luxury goods segment, has been on a continuous
growth spree since then as well. By 2020, spending in the Indian luxury
market is expected to increase more than double to Rs 23,600 crores from
Rs 13,200 crores.

With more than 40 years in newspapers, I'm blessedly close to the end of
my working life. As this old horse lopes toward the stable, his
principal concern is whether he has enough oats stored in the silo.

I don't worry about how I'll fill my retirement days. There are too many
great books I haven't read, places yet to see and old friends I'd like
to see again. Though I've loved this job, I don't expect to be bored
when I walk away from it because I don't define myself by what I do for
a living. That way of thinking evidently puts me out of step with much
of the white-collar world.

Experian abandoned its proposed acquisition of start-up rival ClearScore
three months after the UK regulator indicated that it would block the
transaction because it viewed the credit-checking tie-up as likely to
stifle competition in the sector.

W arren Buffett never bets against the US, the country where he built
his fortune. "The record of American business has been extraordinary ...
We are lucky — gloriously lucky — to have that force at our back," he
wrote in his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders on Saturday.

He should have been less patriotic about Kraft, the processed food group
that makes staples such as Kraft Macaroni & Cheese and Velveeta, a
bright yellow "processed cheese product". The merger that he engineered
between Heinz and Kraft in 2015 has turned out very badly: Heinz paid
too much for an indigestible bunch of ageing brands in the wrong country.

Importance of Fashion

"Access to social media, increased disposable income and infrastructure
development has greatly enhanced fashion consciousness as well as access
to it. Over the last decade, the concept of shopping has undergone a sea
change in pertinence to changing consumer behaviour. The glamour and
elegance associated with fashion is huge attention and attraction
grabber. And with fashion going social on Pinterest, Instagram, Facebook
and Twitter, the category has become a key focus area in our endeavor to
deliver a wholesome experience to our patrons," says Arjun Gehlot,
Director, Ambience Mall, Gurgaon & Vasant Kunj.

The growth trajectory of the Indian Fashion Retail Industry is on an
all-time high. With around 400 national and international fashion brands
operating successfully in the Indian market, it is boom time for the
sector. Be it Tier I, II & III cities, the *Millennial* population
everywhere is becoming more fashion conscious and is all about new
trends in fashion, buying both offline and online.

This, as well as the snow-balling popularity of social media, has opened
unprecedented retail opportunities for the fashion industry. And mall
developers in India have been quick to take advantage. They are
increasingly allotting more and more space to fashion brands, which in
turn are aggressively expanding across the country. Western wear brands,
including fast fashion and casual wear, are also becoming more and more
popular, expanding rapidly due to increasing consumer demand.

We are at the beginning of the most radical transformation of the
foodservice industry. Until now, technological innovations in the
industry meant ordering food from an app or paying bill through tablets.
But now restaurant owners are upping the ante, taking the game to the
next level by experimenting with technology like never before. From
introducing interactive smart tables and virtual bars to replacing
servers with robots, restaurateurs are revolutionising the foodservice
industry in the best way possible to enhance the overall customer
experience.

The kid's fashion segment is witnessing unmatched action in India over
the last few years. The *millennial* culture has provided kids' fashion
with a much needed boost, unveiling the true potential of the segment to
the fashion retail fraternity

Denim apparel has traversed an interesting trajectory from being a work
wear to an attire for all occasions, for age groups, for both the
genders across the globe. In India as well, denim no more remains a
men's-only category, with penetration increasing in both women and kids'
segments.

In recent years, several shipments went abroad with the label made in
Argentina. They were distributed around the world: slippers that can be
heated in the microwave arrived in the United States, in Japan they
received a three-dimensional reproduction of a female breast and in
Russia, ropes for the balalaika, a typical instrument of the Slavic
country. The three examples are real and are part of an entrepreneurial
ecosystem that sends its niche products abroad and tries to win markets
with quality and specialty as flags, and in some cases, far from
competing for price. For niche products, a small domestic market is not
enough. When growth depends on reaching a higher volume, the possibility
of exporting is presented as a healthy alternative. The jump of the
exchange rate in 2018 encouraged several entrepreneurs to take their
first steps outside despite common problems to place products in other
markets.

Last week, as I was scrolling through social media, I was stopped by a
post that at first glance might seem quite innocuous. It read, "Travel.
Your money will return. Your time won't."

When I checked today, this post had received almost 3,800 likes and
almost 200 comments. Most of them were positive, almost cheering, saying
they needed to hear that today, or tagging friends and suggesting they
take a trip.

ATLANTA — The supplicants came bearing tithes. Salted cashews, a plastic
fruit cup, homemade crafts. The guest of honor, a Virginia opossum named
Starfish, sat curled atop a pink fleece bomber jacket, spitting out
chewed-up almond detritus. The animal appeared indifferent to the point
of distraction, beady eyes staring far past the shelves of combat boots
surrounding her and into some unknown realm.

“Sometimes she falls asleep with her eyes open,” said Ally Burguieres,
Starfish’s caretaker, to a fan.

Abbotsford News -- Three years after he promised to sell an all-electric
Model 3 mass-market sedan for $35,000 before incentives, Elon Musk is
finally coming through. The Tesla Inc. chief executive announced
Thursday that a low-priced, range version will soon be available in the U.S.

Musk also announced that the company's cars will be sold online only.
Retail stores will be converted into showrooms and information centers,
he said. He didn't say how many stores will close, or whether the shift
will affect the company's workforce.

How does a country like India straddle its ancient spiritual wisdom and
modern consumerist aspirations?

For far too long consumerism in a spiritual nation like India has had an
uneasy narrative to follow. However, today, thanks to various success
stories, including those via Indian spiritual leaders, we are showing
the world that one's spiritual inclinations can definitely co-exist with
the desire to pursue comfortable lifestyles, as well as in building,
purchasing, and promoting newer brands.

To address the manufacturing industry's digital skills gap, more needs
to be done to make the sector more attractive to millennials. A recent
survey for Barclays Corporate Banking showed that only six per cent of
16 to 23-year-olds are considering a career in manufacturing.

Our own study "The future of the automotive industry: Navigating the
skills gap" found that just 19 per cent of students declared a STEM
(science, technology, engineering or mathematics) subject as a
favourite, with double that number favouring arts and humanities. There
was also a clear reticence to undertake work-based or vocational
education, with only 12 per cent of the students surveyed preferring
hands-on learning and only 9 percent interested in apprenticeships.

After a weekend of intense campaigning, delegate cajoling and vigorous
debate, California Republicans selected Kevin McCarthy ally Jessica
Patterson as the next chairwoman of the CRP at their spring convention
in Sacramento. Patterson, a *millennial* Latina, defeated former
Assemblyman Travis Allen, R-Huntington Beach, and longtime party
activist Steve Frank.

As first order of business, the Ventura County resident will now be
tasked with bringing the party’s voter registration numbers out of the
basement, winning back legislative seats that were lost in the November
election and changing the public perception of a party that former
Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said was “dying at the box office.”

While discount retailer TJX Cos. has lots of fans on Wall
Street—especially after reporting solid fourth-quarter earnings on
Wednesday—UBS analyst Jay Sole isn't one of them.

Of the 29 analysts who cover the stock (ticker: TJX), Sole is the only
one with a Sell rating, according to FactSet. In a note on Thursday, he
raised his price target by a dollar, to $43. But he reiterated his bear
case, arguing the stock still has 17% downside from recent levels.

Conversations surrounding diversity and inclusion—or, more pointedly,
the lack thereof—have become a regular occurrence in the ad industry.
Unfortunately, less attention is paid to the monumental creative
accomplishments made by people of color throughout the discipline’s
history. The work they’ve produced over the past 50-plus years has
played a vital role in defining advertising as we know it today, even if
most of their names are not as well-known as those of other industry icons.

“We have these same conversations [around diversity in advertising], and
there seems to be no traction, but those conversations are easy to
sell,” said VCU Brandcenter executive director and former JWT Atlanta
CCO Vann Graves. “Whereas where there are successes, they’re rarely
celebrated.”

Is it worth investing in such a plan or how this policy can benefit me?

for buying a Life Insurance Policy. Getting married, buying a new house
or having kids or dependents could be some of those.

Ariana Grande makes me feel old. Not quite geriatric, but out of touch.

This is probably because I'm an old *millennial*.

It’s no secret that many small towns in America are facing an economic
crisis where there simply aren’t enough jobs to go around. As a result,
many states are losing young talent to major metropolitan cities that
offer better career opportunities—and rural America is being hit the
hardest. Add in the reality that the *millennial* generation is saddled
with record levels of student debt, and the chances of young
professionals staying in their small cities and rural towns to pursue a
career are lower than ever. Clearly, something needs to be done to keep
local economies going, and that doesn’t mean government handouts.
