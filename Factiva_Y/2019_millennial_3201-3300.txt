Star Rating: 4 stars

​Fifty years ago this month, the Theatre
Upstairs[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-reviews/10580611/The-Pass-Royal-Court-Theatre-Upstairs-review.html]
– the Royal Court’s second auditorium – opened. Tightly confined yet
creatively liberating, this attic space has served as a crucible of
talent, propelling new names to the fore and allowing old-hands to
experiment. Is an 85-minute monologue a low-key way of marking its
half-century? Yes. Yet Nicôle Lecky’s Superhoe does the job brilliantly.

The New York representative has a six-step skincare routine – and isn’t
afraid to talk about it. What does it say about those who subscribe to
similar multistep regimes?

Last week, towards the end of her first month in office, Alexandria
Ocasio-Cortez posted a five-page Instagram story on her skin routine and
it split the internet.

Historic Camden music site sold to metal recycler.

A grandiose plan to revive and restore Camden’s great musical history at
one of the last remaining RCA Victor buildings has hit a sour note.
Instead, the place where Frank Sinatra signed a contract and Fats Waller
made phonograph recordings has been sold for $13.5 million to a South
Jersey metal recycling firm.

Located at Front and Cooper Streets, the eight-story building has been
called the most historic place for recorded music in the world. It is
where the Victor Talking Machine Co. built a music dynasty in downtown
Camden, churning out records and legendary artists such as Louis
Armstrong, Tommy Dorsey, Duke Ellington, and Billie Holiday recorded for
the label.

Volvo's close-knit design team has created an enviable run of hits but
now must forge a fresh look for its new-era cars. Julian Rendell is
reassured by what he hears

The next generation of Volvo cars will evolve their styling and remain
faithful to the restrained look of the current range. To boost customer
appeal, advanced batteryelectric powertrains and self-driving technology
will be applied.

New Delhi, Feb. 6 -- In 2015, I attended a session for senior women
professionals conducted by Prof. Stacy Blake-Beard at the Simmons School
of Management in Boston. I watched in amazement as Prof. Blake-Beard
conducted her routine classroom exercise, asking participants to solve a
set of 15 seemingly simple, general knowledge questions. The women
struggled with what had looked like a rather easy task. When the
professor asked them how this made them feel, the answers ranged from
"stupid" and "inadequate" to "frustrated" and "intimidated". She then
asked her students to form groups of five and work on the same
exercise-needless to say, success came early this time.

This simple act of "collaborating" was meant to open their eyes to the
importance of networking.

The inaugural Urban Work Index, funded by RBC Future Launch, places the
Nickel City in the top fifth of centres analyzed by a Toronto-based

This program, an initiative of Finnovista, offers accompaniment and

Unilever has snapped up Graze, the healthy snacking brand, as it
continues its "bolt-on" acquisition strategy focusing on fast-growing
companies.

The Anglo-Dutch consumer goods group group, which makes hundreds of
products including Magnum ice cream, Lynx deodorant and Surf detergent,
said that it had bought Graze as it was a "truly multichannel brand"
that offered convenience and nutritional benefits while attracting
*millennial* consumers.

A new report released by the Ryerson School of Urban and Regional
Planning shows Prince Edward County is facing a deepening housing crisis
that is starting to hold back economic growth.

The study, which was commissioned by Community Futures of Prince Edward
Lennox Addington, determined housing costs have jumped by more than 40
per cent since 2006, making it harder for local workers to find
affordable accommodation.The report also found there has been a decline
of nearly 10 per cent in the number of rental units on the market since
2011.

All lives matter" is the booming clarion call of the Cancer Coalition
Philippines, a consortium of cancer support and advocacy groups that
recently successfully lobbied both houses of Congress to pass the cancer
bill strengthening government and private response to cancer treatment
and prevention.

A corollary motto might also be "no one left behind," assuring resources
and efforts to every Filipino struggling with cancer regardless of
"cancer stage, age, gender and ethnicity."

As a student, many moons ago, banks had a number of tricks to attract me
as a customer. Back then, all day-to-day banking was free, so it was
attractive to open an account with all of the banks to get a free USIT
card, music voucher, or €10 lodgement.

The accounts would linger on with barely a bob or two to sustain them,
until finally, at some point in my 20s, I picked a "winner" and closed
the others.

* After 29-year-old Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's stunning upset against
Rep. Joe Crowley in the New York Democratic congressional primary in
June, the word "socialist" was repeatedly used to describe her.

* "Socialist" remains a dirty, and often misunderstood, term in the

OTHERS Last week at a school in Patna, Neha Singh’s Jhalkari
unassumingly completed 35 shows since first opening in December 2017 at
Andheri Base, a suburban fringe venue in Mumbai. That might seem like a
modest figure for a time span of more than a year, but in experimental
theatre circles, where lining-up shows is often an art in itself, it
counts for a reasonably good innings given the usual constraints
productions operate under.

MOST leasehold condominium buildings are in the city centre and in
high-potential locations where developers cannot buy land or where the
land belongs to the state agencies and the Crown Property Bureau. Such
locations cover the Rajdamri area, Langsuan and Rama IV Road, according
to a survey by property agency Nexus Property Marketing Co Ltd. 

The company’s managing director, Nalinrat Chareonsuphong, said a total
of 4,500 leasehold condominium units from 22 projects was available in
the centre of Bangkok. Of the total, more than 67 per cent are located
in Langsuan and Rajdamri.

When we caught up with Shantanu Mehra, one half of designer duo Shantanu
& Nikhil, way before the Lakme Absolute Ultimate Finale by Shantanu &
Nikhil, he was totally tight-lipped about his finale muse Kareena Kapoor
Khan’s look. But he did open up about the collection — Recruit — that
brought the curtains down on Lakme Fashion Week Summer Resort 2019 in
Mumbai on Sunday night.

What is the story of Recruit?

BENGALURU: Chartered accountant-turned-pastry chef Nithya Sunil, about
to turn 30, is proud of not only the eatery, Blackboard Bakery, she has
opened on Lavelle Road but also of having picked up a new “life skill” —
living independently in a three bedroom house in Benson Town despite her
parents living locally. While the decision was made against her mother’s
wish and it costs her Rs 27,000 a month in rent, her father supported
her. Today, weekends are spent qualitatively together at either’s homes.
“Nobody takes you seriously when you switch careers and take the
unconventional path,” says Sunil. “Coming to an empty home is a hard
lesson but the home grows on you. I designed it according to my
sensibilities. I learnt to budget. As a single working professional, it
is important to learn survival skills in the home sphere before getting
married.” Like Sunil, many *millennial* women are opting to reside
separately from their parents the same city.

Change is always easier with someone who knows it. That explains why
Akhil Handa was cherrypicked to lead the digital transformation of Bank
of Baroda, India’s second largest public sector bank.Handa’s varied
career trajectory makes him well versed at handling and orchestrating
change at a 110-year- old public sector bank. He has been a fintech
entrepreneur, industry analyst and investment banker with JP Morgan and
a founding member of CAG – the professional support group for PM Modi’s
2014 campaign.In his current role as the Advisor to MD and CEO and Head
of fintech and new business initiatives at Bank of Baroda, Akhil Handa
is working zealously to make Bank of Baroda’s transformation into a
digital bank possible and plausible.Not so long ago, Bank of Baroda was
perceived as an old-line public sector bank; way too old and antiquated
in its business processes.

In a first, India’s ace shuttler PV Sindhu took the centre stage at the
fashion gala to display Misfit Panda’s latest shoe collection called
‘The Secret Garden’. Misfit Panda by Juveca Panda, a women’s footwear
brand showcased recreated the sheer beauty and magnificence of Lake Como
that at times feels surreal and almost dream like.

Inspired by the label’s creative director Juveca Panda’s travel from
Milan to Lake Como, The Secret Garden is an interesting melange of
bright pop colours and pastel hues, comfort and style. Meant for the
globe-trotting urban *millennial* woman, the shoes remind of a breezy
Italian summer—of picturesque landscapes, scenic locales, lush vineyards
and old, secluded manor houses.

those consumers who celebrate the joy of missing out (JOMO).

Natural and human-induced hydrological changes can influence organic
carbon (OC) composition in fluvial systems, with biogeochemical
consequences in both terrestrial and marine environments. Here, we use
bulk and molecular carbon isotopes (13C and 14C) to examine
spatiotemporal variations in particulate OC (POC) composition and age
from two locations along the course of the Yellow River during 2015 and
2016. Dual carbon isotopes enable deconvolution of modern, pre-aged
(*millennial* age) soil, and fossil inputs, revealing heterogeneous OC
sources at both sites. Pre-aged OC predominated at the upstream site
(Huayuankou) throughout the study period, mostly reflecting the upper
riverine OC. Strong downstream (Kenli) intra-annual variations in modern
and pre-aged OC were caused by increased contributions from modern
aquatic OC production under the drier and less turbid conditions during
this El Niño year.

With its huge national audience, the State of the Union address stands
as a premier example of what the late political scientist Richard
Neustadt famously described as the most important presidential asset of
all, "the power to persuade."

This year's speech, though, is more likely to showcase how Donald Trump
remains focused on a different lever of presidential influence: "the
power to incite" those who already agree with him

Our team at Gillette sparked an important worldwide conversation with
the new "We Believe" ad[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koPmuEyP3a0].
The film shows men being role models by stepping in to stop bullying and
harassment and demonstrating how to treat people with respect. It has
gotten nearly 100 million views on social media. We're proud of the ad's
message about what it means to be a good man today, and how men can step
up to reject bad behavior and take positive action.

Not everyone agrees with the message and there have been some vocal
detractors. Some said the ad attacks masculinity, while others said it
sounded like a lecture.

The film shows men being role models by stepping in to stop bullying and
harassment and demonstrating how to treat people with respect. It has
gotten nearly 100 million views on social media. We're proud of the ad's
message about what it means to be a good man today, and how men can step
up to reject bad behavior and take positive action.

Not everyone agrees with the message and there have been some vocal
detractors. Some said the ad attacks masculinity, while others said it
sounded like a lecture.

Miller Lite, a brand in the Chicago-based MillerCoors beer portfolio,
took out a full page ad in Tuesday’s New York Times to keep alive the
conversation about corn syrup that rival brew Bud Light audaciously
brought up in a Super Bowl ad on Sunday.

Unlike most of the Super Bowl ads that were posted long before game day,
the Bud Light ad in question was kept tightly under wraps until it aired
Sunday. It quickly sparked what Miller Lite billed in the New York Times
ad as “an unnecessary #corntroversy."

French beauty brand L’Occitane Group is moving towards fully sustainable
packaging.

The group, owners of brands like L’Occitane en Provence and Melvita, is
aiming to use only sustainable plastic in its packaging. (Currently,
only 30 percent of L’Occitane’s products are made with recycled plastic
and its exclusive to darker-colored items, like its namesake brand’s
Immortelle Precious.) Through its new efforts with sustainable plastic
provider Loop Industries, the brand expects to be fully sustainable by
2025. L’Occitane Group would not reveal the investment in this partnership.

KUALA LUMPUR: THE global consumer goods and retail sector had a strong
year in terms of mergers and acquisitions (M&As) in 2018, with the
number of deals increasing 25 per cent from 2017.

While global consumer M&As are expected to decrease from US$700 billion
(RM2.8 trillion) to US$629 billion this year, the sector would still be
significantly more buoyant than other industries, including finance,
technology and healthcare, according to Baker McKenzie.

LOS ANGELES, Feb. 5 -- JNSQ issued the following news release:

Introducing the first rose brand created for *millennial* women that
doesn't talk over them, or down to them. JNSQ Rose Cru is an
easy-to-enjoy luxury wine created in the classic French style and
crafted from premium California grapes, giving it both a timeless
elegance and a modern attitude. This unprecedented approach to
winemaking - and the name gracing the beautifully curvaceous bottle -
were inspired by today's young women setting the world on fire on their

He's made a name for himself in critically acclaimed films like Call Me
By Your Name and the Ruth Bader Ginsberg biopic On The Basis Of Sex.

And Armie Hammer admitted that, while he's worked hard to get where he
is, it would be wrong of him to not think he's benefited from having
white privilege.

Subscribers to the London Times this Monday found a familiar face,
Luciana Berger, writing about a wearily familiar topic in British
politics: the resurgence of hard-left anti-Semitism. Berger is one of
the UK Labour Party's highest profile Jewish MPs, a prominent activist
since her college days. Three far-right trolls have
served[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-29695846] jail
sentences[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/feb/10/internet-troll-who-sent-labour-mp-antisemitic-messages-is-jailed]

Our team at Gillette sparked an important worldwide conversation with
the new "We Believe" ad[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koPmuEyP3a0].
The film shows men being role models by stepping in to stop bullying and
harassment and demonstrating how to treat people with respect. It has
gotten nearly 100 million views on social media. We're proud of the ad's
message about what it means to be a good man today, and how men can step
up to reject bad behavior and take positive action.

Not everyone agrees with the message and there have been some vocal
detractors. Some said the ad attacks masculinity, while others said it
sounded like a lecture.

Tuesday morning at TCA started off with a hearty dose of inclusivity and
representation with Freeform’s Youth Movement panel which consisted of
producers and cast members from Pretty Little Liars: The Perfectionists,
Grown-ish, and Good Trouble, which, right before the panel, was renewed
for a second season (members of the cast were more than ecstatic when
the news was announced).

Grown-ish and Good Trouble are certainly on-brand for the
*millennial*-driven channel and based on its predecessor, The
Perfectionists will certainly be cut from the same cloth. The shows have
given a different perspective of today’s youth — a perspective you
rarely see on television. Often times, young adults are talked down to
or seen as precious on various dramas and sitcoms, but with this trio of
shows, they represent young adults in the opposite direction.

2019 FEB 5 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at
China Weekly News -- Investigators publish new report on Geology.
According to news originating from Lanzhou, People's Republic of China,
by VerticalNews correspondents, research stated, "The record of the
Holocene *millennial*-scale climate variations from the aeolian deposit
around the monsoonal boundary zone in northern China is poorly
understood because the desert sediments are usually scattered and
geological archives are discontinuous. Here, we conducted magnetic,
sedimentological, and geochemical analyses of the palaeosol-aeolian sand
sequence from the eastern Horqin dune field in northeastern China, which
documented the detailed history of climatic variations during the past
7.0 ka."

Funders for this research include Natural Science Foundation of Gansu
Province, China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, National Natural
Science Foundation of China.

According to news originating from La Jolla, California, by VerticalNews

geomagnetic field contributes significantly to understanding the origin
of *millennial*-scale paleomagnetic secular variations, the structure of
geomagnetic excursions, and the long-term shielding by the geomagnetic
field. A compilation of paleomagnetic sediment records and
archeomagnetic and lava flow data covering the past 100ka enables
reconstruction of the global geomagnetic field on such long-term scales."

Hello!

Sunday was a letdown for us advertising and media reporters, and it
wasn’t just the ads that felt lackluster. It was the lowest-rated Super
Bowl in 11 years, with 98.2 million viewers. It speaks to the ongoing
erosion of live and linear TV.

The personal finance book is a slowly fading genre. I’m not sure why –
it could be that so much good content is available online, or it could
be that only a few authors have something fresh to say.

Most of today’s relevant personal finance authors write about
retirement. The money side of retirement is a topic that becomes
unwieldy when you research it online. A good book walks you through the
key points in a logical way that helps you build a greater
understanding. Here are three books on retirement that you may find useful:

Shahidi) as she navigates collegiate life. With stories told through a
*millennial* lens, the show explores a wide berth of social, political
and relationship issues facing students in the world of higher education.

Restaurants across the country are going card only in a bid to speed up
service, reduce bank payments and increase security. But with some
calling the move classist and elitist, should you cash in on the trend
for cashless?

Two things happened in 2017 which, when the history of cash is written,
may be seen as the first tolling of its death knell.

For several years, it was nearly impossible to open a trade journal,
read a newspaper or watch the news without hearing about the
*millennial* generation. It’s true that they make up most of today’s
workforce and HR teams need to customize their offerings to appeal to
them. But now, there’s a new set of fresh faces entering the workplace:
Generation Z — those in the 18- to 24-year-old range. In less than a
decade, these young people will make up about 20% of the U.S. workforce.

BEIJING — If China’s e-commerce players were high school archetypes,
Xiaohongshu, also known as Red, would be the cool, hipster girl.

Tmall and JD.com may be the the most popular and dominant — online
shopping’s prom king and queen — but for the *Millennial* and Gen Z
female, it’s hard to wrest the crown from Xiaohongshu.

There are no prettier cannabis stores than those of MedMen Enterprises,
the chain whose West Hollywood flagship shop claims higher sales per
square foot than Tiffany's. But a new lawsuit filed by the pot chain's
former finance chief alleges some ugly behavior by the Canada-listed
company and its chief executive, Adam Bierman.

The complaint alleges that MedMen (ticker: MMEN.Canada) made payments to
bolster its stock price, violated federal campaign-finance laws and
served as a personal "piggy bank" for Bierman—paying for the CEO's
customized Cadillacs, therapist, armed guards, and home renovations. In
his complaint, former CFO James Parker also says that he heard Bierman
use racial, misogynistic, and antigay epithets aimed at employees and
others.

Young consumers lack the data to support traditional credit scoring, but
there's plenty of payments information that can fill the gap.

Alternative data such as rent, utility and telecom payments where the
volume of reporting is improving may provide solutions to better
assessing *millennial* credit risk as well. A lender’s own proprietary
information can also help bridge the gap.

With its huge national audience, the State of the Union address stands
as a premier example of what the late political scientist Richard
Neustadt famously described as the most important presidential asset of
all, "the power to persuade."

This year's speech, though, is more likely to showcase how Donald Trump
remains focused on a different lever of presidential influence: "the
power to incite" those who already agree with him

trends A muted shade of rose is the style council's neutral gear for
spring. It's a low-key but high impact, says Emma McCarthy

THERE'S much chatter in fashionland right now on the subject of
neutrals. Is beige the new black? Or — gasp! — is khaki poised to
replace camel? But look outside the industry bubble — or conduct a quick
survey of any Tube carriage — and you'll soon realise that everyone in
the real world is still dressed exclusively in black, grey or navy.

There's a dirty little secret of the student debt crisis. One that
affects millions of borrowers, but isn't talked about at dinner tables,
on social media or in think pieces about student loans.

The taboo topic is wage garnishment and it works like this: Default on
your federal student loans and the government can take up to 15 per cent
of each paycheque to satisfy your debt. That amounts to $300 per month
for someone who normally takes home $2,000 per month. The Education
Department can also withhold federal benefits like tax returns and
Social Security payments.

There are two cultural narratives about how millennials spend their
money adjacent to the recent cultural conversation about work,

abbreviated, disposable or shareable.
