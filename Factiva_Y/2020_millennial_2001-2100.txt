Bernie Sanders’s victory in New Hampshire on top of his tie in Iowa
makes him a favourite for the Democratic presidential nomination. Hard
to believe but in a winnable race against President Donald Trump, the
opposition may nominate a socialist senator who wants the government to
control energy production and healthcare, who wants nationwide rent
control, and who calls America a “racist society from top to bottom”. No
wonder Democrats such as James Carville are in agony.

The Vermont revolutionary’s victory portends a long primary battle,
unless Democratic voters elevate a single mainstream candidate who can
challenge him. Sanders will get his 25 to 30 per cent primary after
primary, racking up delegates on his way to the convention.

When I used to visit my dad in the cancer ward of Maine Medical Center,
some of the doors of the hospital rooms had signs on them restricting
entry. The patients inside had compromised immune systems because of
their cancer treatments, so only a small number of (presumably vetted
and decontaminated) people were allowed inside.

I always held my breath when I walked past those doors. When I entered
the cancer ward I was always terrified that somehow I would bring in
germs from the outside world, germs I wouldn't notice and that my
healthy immune system could fight off without a problem, but germs that
could kill an already-sick person. I felt a sense of responsibility for
their well-being.

Niche television channels such as English entertainment, movies,
infotainment and lifestyle, were dealt a setback in 2019. By the end of
the year, there was an additional toll from a weakening economic
environment that further pressured the channels, something that impacted
the media and entertainment industry at large. Phrases such as 'reset
for the industry', 'huge transition', and 'biggest disruption for the
industry' were commonly used to address the change in the ecosystem
following the implementation of NTO. Over the last six months, after the
dust has settled down, monthly impressions among English Movies, English
Entertainment Channel (EEC), Infotainment and Food & Lifestyle genres
have increased. The EEC genre impressions, for instance, grew from
1,39,66,000 in April to 1,81,71,000 in November of 2019. Similarly,
impressions in the Food & Lifestyle genre grew from 898,83,000 in April
to 1047,52,000 in November, 2019, according to BARC data.

I first came to learn about the banig weavers of Basey, Samar, many
moons ago when in a pre-Yolanda morning, I explored the entirety of San
Juanico Bridge on foot.

I arrived in Samar with no destination in mind until a local I
encountered pointed me to a fascinating place. 'You can go to Basey, it
is a small town not far from here. There's an old church there and a
cave where you will see women weavers making beautiful banig,' he told
me in Tagalog.

It looks like excellent weather for great music will be coming our way
in the next two months of 2020. No, we're not talking about the initial
surge of climate change impacts. We're referring to livewire concert
action that could change the increasingly uncool climate of music in
these parts.

So yeah, let's welcome some warm winds to blow across the next two
months and take us to more exciting times ahead.

By the time he was making music while attending Taylor Allderdice, Wiz
Khalifa wasn't acting. But just a few years earlier he was involved in
theater while a student at the now-shuttered Regent Square Elementary.
It's an art form he re-embraces as he voices a recurring character on
Fox's new animated comedy "Duncanville" (8:30 p.m. Sunday, WPGH-TV).

The series follows 15-year-old Duncan Harris (voiced by executive
producer Amy Poehler), an average kid with a rich fantasy life, a meter
maid mom, Annie (Poehler again), and an emotional dad, Jack (Ty Burrell,
"Modern Family"). And like all the kids at school, Duncan admires
Khalifa's character, Mr. Mitch, a guidance counselor/teacher/gym coach
(it's a public school - there were budget cuts).

There’s a frustrating chicken-or-egg dilemma in the financial world: You
try to get access to a credit card to build a credit history, but you
can’t get approved without a history. And this is the track record
that's used to generate your credit score.

This can be especially frustrating for recent college graduates, even
those with student loans. Unless they started making payments on that
debt during school, they haven't necessarily established credit history.

*HD* 	The commodification of wellness: Self-care has become an industry.
But you don’t need to spend to feel better; Self-care has quickly become
synonymous with consumption, but feeling good on the inside has nothing
to do with buying something new

At a bookstore recently, I happened upon a selection of goods curated
for the “wellness minded,” a group the shop’s signage described as those
who treat self-care as a way of life. There were jigsaw puzzles and
hardcover journals alongside kits for knitting and reflexology.

With roots in the medical world, self-care is a term used to describe
activities and behaviours that promote well-being. The practice of
setting aside time to develop a better awareness of how you’re feeling
can be a powerful tool that has the potential to affect our mental
health. But the store display is just one small example of how the
self-care concept has also become a mass marketing ploy. As a result, we
run the risk of corrupting its meaning and devaluing its effectiveness.

In social media times, love has become a little more entangled. Now
stalking is synonymous with spying, watching doubt, distrust, getting in
the way of social media and the life of the other; a 'like' in a photo
or the absence of this and the 'delete for all' option from Whatsapp,
can be cause for discord in the couple, and a 'lock' the reason to
end.Even the new declaration of love, in the *millennial* era, is "I've
uninstalled Tinder" and the most practical way to end a relationship is
through a digital medium, to avoid the compromising "face to
face"."Relationships changed in a radical way. We're at a time when you
do things according to what you think the other and manage the networks
accordingly. We are living more than for ourselves, for what others think.

particularly those aged 18 to 29, as a result of his pledges to enact
universal healthcare and wipe out student debt.

* But older voters are mostly absent from the Sanders coalition, and
many hold unfavorable views of socialism.

If you’ve been to the theater lately, you may have noticed something
missing: the intermission.

The musical Come From Away, about what happened in Gander, Newfoundland,
when 38 planes were stranded there on Sept. 11, 2001, came and went from
the Academy of Music this season without a break in its 100 heartfelt
minutes. The Band’s Visit was even shorter. In 95 minutes, it also told
a story about extending a warm welcome to accidental visitors, running
straight through to their departure.

Two recent events in Central America should draw attention to the
dangers of authoritarianism. Bukele in El Salvador demonstrated this by
suppressing the system of power independence for a few hours. He did so
on the same path of Peru's Fujimori in the last century, or Serrano's
failed attempt in Guatemala. It is a paradox that Bukele, taking on
herself as a *millennial*, has retreated with this unconstitutional
action to the nineteenth-century, imitating the liberal dictator Gerardo
Barrios who effectively suppressed the legislative power by abusing
enormous powers that allowed him omnimode power, in the name of progress.

Meanwhile in Guatemala, Congress, maneuvering its own Agenda, passed a
law of NGOs clearly undemocratic and without legal body in the
Constitution. The veiled intention to criminalize social protest is
mainly criticized.

The country’s popular, social media-savvy president marched troops into
the parliament to demand $109m in security funds

It was a scene evoking bad memories of a bloody era in a country with a
recent history of authoritarianism and civil war.

At what point does a home become too large to be a good return on
investment?

A lot of us would welcome a little more space at home, all else being
equal. That's partly why Americans spent $30 billion on room additions
and exterior add-ons like decks, porches, and garages in 2017, according
to Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies. But when does a big home
become too big — and risk overwhelming buyers?

Day 4 at Lakme Fashion Week saw quite a few designers showcasing outfits
that would be ideal for the upcoming summer wedding season, and in
particular, the *millennial* brides.

The collection, 'Coraline' was showcased by designer Prreeti Jaiin
Nainutia, under her label Nirmooha. The collection was inspired by
underwater and had outfits perfect for a bride who is planning to have a
pre-wedding pool party or a party by the beach. It consisted of hues
like white, pink and, blue, and the fabrics and the style was apt for a
summer affair.

Let's raise our tumblers and toast to cheaper wine.

The price of
wine[http://www.cnn.com/2020/02/13/politics/trump-tariff-wine-cheese-europe/index.html]
is expected to drop to its lowest levels in five years thanks, in part,
to a surplus of California grapes.

If we have reached peak hipster-chic, the new nhow London hotel is a

500 trends crammed into one space.

I met the man who became my husband at a book party in a downtown loft
in late spring. In retrospect, meeting that way was auspicious, an
indication of a shared passion, if not for the particular book being
feted that evening -- one about the dawning gig economy that has long
since been surpassed by bleaker fare -- than for books in general. But
at the time, I wanted nothing to do with him.

''Hello, I'm Mark,'' he said warmly, extending his hand with (I came to
learn) characteristic frankness. ''Who are you?''

The Association of Filipino Franchisers Inc., the home of Filipino
home-grown franchisers, believes that the three I’s—Improvement,
Integration and Innovation—will be the name of the game for SMEs this
year. Many MSMEs have to learn to fully embrace technology by
integrating new systems that will help improve and innovate their business.

AFFI noted, though, that while the 3-I’s are catalysts in business
development trends this year, *millennial* consumer behavior remains as
a major influencer of business trends for 2020. For one, some as young
as 18-years-old already earn enough money, those who work mostly in
business process outsourcing companies to transform them into “entitled
spenders.”

In a conversation of days ago with my son Ivan, we discussed how
important it is to promote the development of dance.

As a historian I have been able to read how important dance has been to
humanity, and it is present according to research in the *millennial*
cultures of Asia, the Middle East, Greece, etc. including America, where
direct and indirect evidence has been found in texts, cave paintings,
paintings and engravings, in high and low reliefs that have survived and
include not only their existence but also their evolution, first
associated with religious rites but that was not why they lacked
aesthetic content that went away Cultivating for the spiritual
exaltation of the human being and seeking, yet of joy and personal and
group accomplishment.

With so much vying for our attention, we only have the power to change
what is on our doorstep, writes Niamh Horan

OF all the insults thrown at Sinn Fein supporters in the past week,
perhaps the most grating is the assertion that they are an uncaring
bunch willing to coldly overlook years of torture and bloodshed for the
sake of getting their homes built.

Virgin Voyages, which unveils its debut ship next week, is ripping up
the cruise rulebook. But is its 'disrupter' approach really sustainable,
asks Sue Bryant

Drag acts, tattooed crew, dancing on the tables and absolutely no kids
You've got to hand it to Richard Branson — the hype around his newest
project, Virgin Voyages, and its first ship, the £505m Scarlet Lady, is
impressive. The entrepreneur intends to turn traditional cruising on its
head and create a floating Caribbean resort for hedonists, based on what
he calls "rebellious luxe". Away with buffets and ballgowns, no dreary
dinners on preassigned tables and no use of the word "passenger".
Scarlet Lady's customers will be called "sailors".

When Graciela Lazarte started her business of renting temporary offices
in Cordoba, those spaces were dominated more by ashtrays than by
vertical gardens, the coffee machine was "the" quasi-blamed place of
recreation of the staff and the connectivity did not was at the top of
companies' infrastructure demands.

It seems a century has passed, but it was less than 20 years. However,
so profound was the transformation of the workspaces that this lawyer,
creator of Officenter, surfed, in that span, from within. In that
period, the company's offer of "turnkey offices" grew from 150 square
meters to 6,500 meters in four category locations: Capitalinas, Ecipsa
Tower, Cañada Office and Córdoba Office Center.

Walls (Sony) Who is he? One-fourth of *millennial* boy band One
Direction - who have been on indefinite hiatus since 2016 - and the guy
who drew third straw in their clearly co-ordinated campaign of soloalbum
releases. (Liam Payne's LP1 and Harry Styles'Fine Line came out in
December, while Niall Horan's disc is expected later this year. For
those keeping score at home, former member Zayn Malik also has two solo
albums to his credit.)

What is this? His debut solo disc - though he has released a few singles
since 1D started their break. Fun fact: He's the last member of the
group to release an album. Of course, if you were a teenage girl five
years ago, you already knew that. If you weren't, you likely don't care.
Nor should you.

The teenage drama "Tabing Ilog" opened with friends taking turns on the
tire swing by the riverbank on a balmy afternoon. It was a '90s Sunday
afternoon TV staple, and ABS-CBN is giving it a theater treatment set in
the present.

With book by Jade Castro ("Dalawang Gabi"), and music and lyrics by
Vincent de Jesus ("Changing Partners," "Himala" and "Care Divas"),
"Tabing Ilog: The Musical" will run March 7-April 26 at the ABS-CBN
Dolphy Theater in Quezon City.

Where there are millennials, there must be Baby Boomers. In fact, a

disparaging fingers, muttering sibilantly and not always below their

things, actually; but mainly, the morals or lack thereof of the
*millennial*, in matters of the heart. What is interesting that the
millennials do not have any discernable gatekeepers. They are their own
gatekeepers. Of course, it’s still a WIP but they are doing a fairly
good job of negotiating the various minefields that dot the grasslands
of the heart, morals or no morals. And how would I know this? Because I
was to talk on sex, marriage and morality at a lit fest recently and so
conducted a straw poll beforehand. The results were intriguing, to say
the least. The millennials have a sharply calibrated fake-meter and
detest signs of anything ersatz.

I don't get it, this whole obsession with plastic drinking straws.

Yes, straws are an issue, making up between 0.025 per cent and 4 per
cent of ocean plastics, depending on who is counting. And yes, we know
how plastic is killing coral and fish while microplastics have ominously
found their way into our food and water systems.

MUMBAI: LIC Housing Finance has referred 15 stuck infrastructure
projects on which it has a combined exposure of more than Rs 1,100 crore
to the government-approved alternative funding mechanism to help the
stalled ventures generate lastmile financing.“The company has taken
proactive measures to ease last-mile funding needs of these projects by
referring them to the government-created Alternative Investment Fund
(AIF) managed by SBI Caps,” Siddhartha Mohanty, CEO of LIC Housing
Finance, said on Friday. “We have referred around 15 projects on which
we have between Rs 1,100 crore and Rs 1,400 crore of exposure to SBI
Caps that is managing the fund.”In November last year, the government
announced the setting up of a Rs 25,000-crore AIF to provide relief to
developers to complete unfinished projects. This was necessitated after
several housing projects were left unfinished due to the unfavourable
growth environment and a funds squeeze.

Solo,C Java (ANTARA) - The Transportation Ministry plans to turn the
second floor of the Tirtonadi bus terminal in the Central Java city of
Solo into a creative terminal to accommodate *millennial* generation"s
potentials."A team of the Transportation Ministry has intentionally
looked at what the potential is of the Tirtonadi bus terminal. The
presence of a creative center is good so the second floor of the bus
terminal will be turned into one. To function as a creative center
nearly 2,000 sq. mt. of the second floor may be divided into three,"
Transportation Minister Budi Karya Sumadi said while visiting the bus
terminal Saturday.

Pink is the new green we are loving right now. While we’re not ready to
declare pink the new green, but this plant color is super popular these
days. With speckled, striped, or mottled variegation, these plants
deliver an unexpected flush of color to your house or garden without
relying on bright blooms.

It’s a classic tale: Boy gets bullied in high school. Years later, boy
is forced to road-trip with his onetime tormentor. Boy and boy become
friends… and something more? That’s the story at the center of The Thing
About Harry, Freeform’s same-sex romcom starring Grey’s Anatomy’s Jake
Borelli and newcomer Niko Terho as former small-town classmates who
reconnect in college.

Initially, the flick (premiering Saturday at 8/7c) was “kind of a
Hallmark-y Christmas movie with two guys falling in love,”
writer/director Peter Paige (Good Trouble, The Fosters) tells TVLine.
But when he was brought on board to rewrite the script, he decided to
make it more relatable, not only to himself but also to the network’s
audience. “I didn’t grow up in a small town. I don’t really know this
world,” he explains. “I was like, ‘If you’re looking for a young, kind
of Freeform-esque gay romcom, that I can give you.'”

especially those fluent in French.

As former defence procurement honcho Christopher Pyne advises the
government to "hold their feet to the fire" to ensure the French
manufacturers give some submarine-building jobs to Aussie tradies, the
Fin's industrial correspondent Mlle Rowena Métiers-Francais details the
many jobs that Aussies could easily fulfil to help in the construction

If you want a shocking assessment, warts and all, of what the future
working world has in store for us and our stressed-out millennials, you
can do worse than start with Martin Bean, vice-chancellor of the Royal
Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT).

The self-mocking former head of Britain's Open University insists he is
a "glass-half-full kind of guy", but as he walks through the future
pastures of work, many might prefer for that glass to contain a stiff
whisky or two.

them questions about things they don't know anything about. That's our
love language. We call it Not My Job. So eight years ago or so, the
movie director Barry Sonnenfeld came on this show and told us an amazing
story about how, when he was a teenager, he went to see Jimi Hendrix
play at Madison Square Garden. And in the middle of the show, the
loudspeaker blared, Barry Sonnenfeld, call your mother.

Millennials are going to play a pivotal role in the housing market in
India, as per a market survey conducted by 360 Realtors, the nation's
leading Institutional Channel Partner (ICP). The company has surveyed
1200 middle-income *millennial* respondents with an annual income of
over Rs 7 lakh. The survey demonstrated that 75% of the millennials want
to buy a home in another 3 years’ time span.

The study also highlights numerous other key aspects pertaining to
*millennial* buying. This includes their preferred budget for home
buying, media preferences to learn about real estate, financing options
& much more.

A Library of Alexandria has been written about the millennials. The
basic chapters bear the following titles. They will hardly be able to
access a home on property. Their wages are paralyzed. They barely have
the capacity to save. They suffer to pay rents. But in the same sentence
it is also possible to write that it is a generation (born between 1981
and 1996) ruined and at the same time millionaire.

With the often less-than-pleasant winter weather we've had, any thoughts
of outdoor living would be a welcome escape. Well, the B.C. Home and
Garden Show at B.C. Place is coming up Feb. 19 to Feb. 23, and it might
just do the trick to lift those winter doldrums.

I always look forward to speaking at the show, but it also gives me a
chance to check out some of the professionally designed landscapes,
horticultural booths, new styles of greenhouses, innovative growing
ideas, unique outdoor patio displays and all the novel garden accessories.

On 16 January, for the first time since the signing of the peace
agreements that ended the bloody civil war in 1992, the Government of El
Salvador did not commemorate the date. President Nayib Bukele, who takes
selfies at the United Nations General Assembly and tweets with youtubers
as he consolidates the strongest - and most frantic - government in the
country's recent history, is in the past. He must have thought that
celebrating the legacy of the old parties he defeated at the polls a
year ago, even if his contribution was to end a conflict that cost
around 75,000 lives soiled his narrative of national recast and
dignified the opposition.

"We break with the paradigm of sexist porn. We don't circumcise us to
any kind of pornography that invades a woman or dominates her. Now, if a
couple wants to, in an pampered way, to record a domination scene, we
accommodate them...".

Francisco Ramírez (42) explains part of the philosophy of vitiux.com,
the first Chilean platform that produces and sells triple X professional
films. An enterprise in which they seek to raise the squeaking industry
for adults and in which they recruit the generation of actresses and
*millennial* actors.

*HD* 	Sampling too much from the past, Hulu’s ‘High Fidelity’ remix
fails to find its own groove

Hulu’s “High Fidelity” is for people who love to watch a square peg get
painfully hammered into a round hole. The sound of a needle scratching
across an entire side of a beloved vintage LP also comes to mind.

It’s a 10-episode dramedy series (that started streaming Friday) that’s
based on Nick Hornby’s well-received 1995 novel about the lovesick pangs
of a resolutely dyspeptic London record-shop owner trying to get over
his ex-girlfriend. John Cusack, one of Generation X’s preeminent hangdog
crushes, starred in the enjoyable 2000 film adaptation, which relocated
the story to Chicago, introduced the moviegoing public to Jack Black (as
a hyperactive clerk), and turned out to be a fitting ode to a particular
strain of music geekdom that was already marked for extinction. The
story, which was also made into a stage musical, was only ostensibly
about how men and women navigate relationships in their early 30s;
mostly it was about how much some people loved record stores.

Ada Calhoun, author of the bestseller Why We Can't Sleep: Women's New
Midlife Crisis, discusses how she came to write about the pressures and
anxieties faced by an entire demographic

When Betty Friedan wrote The Feminine Mystique in 1963, she discovered a
“problem that has no name" afflicting middle-aged, middleclass American
housewives.

Hot-sauce heiress amasses a modern art collection; years later, has a
dream of a gleaming red structure that evokes the Emerald City in "The
Wizard of Oz." Doodling the image to paper when awake, she eventually
plucks an architect on the cusp of greatness, and works to realize it in
the form of a jewel-box museum in her native Texas. She dies of cancer
before it opens.

True story, so not much prodding was required when I got invited to the
unveiling of Linda Pace's Ruby City - as it is called - in San Antonio a
little while back.

Some of the protagonists of this report confess that they are about to
turn their careers around and do so without drama. Others have
transcended musical genres that for some of us are still avant-garde and
almost look at you strange when you mention it. One of them is about to
crown the pinnacle of fashion, but his real ambition is to take off his
driver's license. They are designers, musicians, models, artists,
performers or actors. The youngest is 15, the oldest is now 40. There
are those who have barely left their bedroom, others are taking their
first steps and are not even quite sure what will be next. But there are
also stars of stratospheric tv outlets, established creators, musicians
who perform at international festivals and award-winning performers.

Two or three years ago, during a working trip to Germany to learn about
"dual study programs," which allow you to train in one of the 350
officially recognized professions in that country by combining work with
university courses, I had one that unexpected: as part of the visit, for
a few hours we toured the city of Cologne (German: Koln), where many
years before my father had been born and i had never had the opportunity
to meet.It was a bird's-eye ride, as we were only able to glimpse it
from a wire. Little remains of the *millennial* history of this city
that was a Roman colony and whose foundation dates back to 50 A.D.

IN A bid to overhaul its brand image, Vicco has signed on leading
matinee idol Alia Bhatt who is also considered a strong voice of
millennials. Alia's track record of successful films that have delivered
stupendous results at the box office and garnered favorable reviews from
critics makes her a frontrunner in multiple categories of brands with
FMCG being no exception.Alia will be representing the brand's headliner
product, Vicco Vajradanti and its variants, a trusted name in the
personal care category. Talking about roping in Alia for the campaign,
Sanjeev Pendharkar, Director, Vicco Laboratories said, "Vicco Vajradanti
has been a household name since 1952. It has a large base of loyal
users. The marketing task was to appeal to the younger generation, the
*millennial* and also make a pure ayurvedic paste a part of their daily
regime." Speaking about engaging with Vicco, youth icon and established
actor, Alia Bhatt stated, "I'm really excited to be a part of this
journey with Vicco.

Ahead of his show tonight at London Fashion Week, Bairbre Power meets
Richard Quinn, the designer who made headlines when Queen Elizabeth sat
on his front row. He talks about the influence of his Irish parents,
childhood memories of Donegal and what it's like dressing some of the
world's most high-profile women Designer Richard Quinn turned the big
3-0 last month and the London-Irish designer received a very special
present when he awoke to the news that global superstar Jennifer Lopez
had stepped out in one of his gowns at the Palm Springs International
Film Festival. It was the latest plot twist in the story of his
phenomenal rise to the top.

Not bad "for an archway in Peckham", says Quinn, referring to his south
London studio with a healthy dose of self-depreciation.

PRETTY WOMAN 1990 Sony Movies, 9.00pm Initially intended as a dark drama
about prostitution in Nineties LA, this romcom has been a huge success;
a musical comes to the West End this week. Edward (Richard Gere), a
millionaire, takes a wrong turn while borrowing his friend's Lotus
Esprit and asks for directions from Vivian (Julia Roberts), a carefree
call-girl. She steers him back to his hotel, he pays her $3,000 to be
his escort for the week and they, improbably, fall in love.

CHUBBY FUNNY 2016 London Live, 10.15pm This low-budget debut feature
from Harry Michell (son of Roger) is a smart and funny *millennial*
tragicomedy. Two young actors share a flat in London: Oscar (Michell),
who has been categorised as "chubby funny" by his agent, and his more
attractive mate, Charlie (Augustus Prew), who seems to be getting all
the work. The emotion is palpable as Oscar struggles with setbacks,
romance and disillusionment.

Young people are flocking to apps that claim to make investing more
accessible. But does this mean they sacrifice returns?

When I started to invest just over a year ago I had a choice to make:
would I do things myself or hand my money over to an adviser or a robot
to manage it for me? I went for the DIY approach. I'd prefer to
understand how things work rather than blindly trusting someone - or
something - else.

There were more than just the usual fashion statements at yesterday's
opening of London Fashion Week (Hannah Rogers writes).

The big luxury brands Mulberry and Anya Hindmarch swapped their standard
presentations for sustainable installations in their London boutiques.

Day 3 at the Lakme Fashion Week 2020 started on a rather promising note
with the 6Degree platform showcasing the couture crafts of some young
and talented designers. Bollywood actress Bipasha Basu and actor Karan
Singh Grover walked the ramp for designer Sanjukta Dutta, as part of her
collection, 'PRAYAASH'.

The collection boasted of an exuberant colour palette and Assamese silk.
The collection in a way was Sanjukta's tribute to stellar artists
including Vincent Van Gogh and Frida Kahlo. The use of beautiful motifs
on the outfits made the collection more eye-catching.

I like to imagine that what happens to God according to Camus: that, if
they exist, they prefer that we do not believe in them. Because to
pamper them, it means in part to burn and ignite them without modesty
where they kept shade. Turn them into fire.

3 Shakespeare classics that took over the Billboard

It is known (and even trite) that Shakespeare's plays are classics that
go through all eras and many have already written and researched about
it. One of them was the great American critic and literary theorist
Harold Bloom, a fervent scholar of the playwright's work who, in The
Invention of the Human, proposed that it is his works that read to us
because they do not imitate life but have created it and in that lies
the reality of their characters.

On the current Billboard there are three Shakespeare plays adapted to
the times that run that exhaust tickets at each performance. Even two of
them have gone from independent to commercial and success continues to
grow. The Old Man's Party, Version of a King Lear Neighborhood; I wish
the walls would scream, proposing a *millennial* Hamlet; and Othelo
(ends badly), a proposal of the eponymous work in the key of clown. What
is the ground for this phenomenon? What does Shakespeare keep telling us
about the world we live in?

FICTION ACTRESS By Anne Enright (£16.99, Jonathan Cape) A novel from the
Booker Prize winner (for 2007's The Gathering) about a daughter's quest
to know her mother. Not just any mother, but a former star of stage and
screen. A meditation on fame, motherhood and sexual power told with
lyrical grace.

*HD* 	THE ETERNAL CHURNING OF THE CREATIVE MIND; Ahead of his arrival at
the Dublin International Film Festival to discuss his extraordinary
career, Oscar-winning screenwriter, producer and director Charlie
Kaufman opens up about his singular approach to filmmaking

Until a little over 20 years ago, few of us knew who Charlie Kaufman
was. He'd toiled for National Lampoon magazine. He'd worked on
experimental plays. He'd helped write a few situation comedies. By the
middle of the following decade he'd become an adjective.

If you played around with your film's time structure and gave a few
lines to an elk, you ran the risk of being labelled "Kaufmanesque". Such
was the impact of Being John Malkovich, Adaptation and Eternal Sunshine
of the Spotless Mind. Such are the challenges of success. Everyone wants
to boil what you do into an easily replicable formula.

all the ways millennials differ from Gen-Z

Seems like it was only yesterday that talk centred on millennials. But
wait for it, here comes the Gen Z or zillenials, if that’s your
preferred term. Millennials refers to the generation born between 1980
and 2000. Gen Z would be those born after. A recent survey by Tata
Capital put forth questions that help in “identifying the exact tipping
point i.e. 25 years of age when there is a behavioral shift in the
attitude of the two age groups.” The study, titled *Millennial* Pivot,
says millennials opt to go for holidays during festivals while their
younger counterparts actually offered a counter-balance to their
materialistic sensibilities. When it comes to festival vacations, 28% of
Generation Z would opt for religious activities compared to just 23% for
millennials. The study also reveals that 47% millennials are more likely
to purchase gifts for themselves compared to 42% Gen Z during festive
seasons.

Being the first people to move into a brand-new building may come with
some risk, but it also has its perks.

Samantha and Jasper Larsen were among the very first residents to move
into 277 Fifth Avenue, and they wear that distinction with pride.

Discounts are an effective way to attract first-time e-wallet customers,
but as more people and businesses adopt cashless payments, they have
become a secondary motivation; many users will use electronic payments
even without cash back or discounts, a recent survey shows.

The survey, conducted by market research firm Ipsos Indonesia showed
that 71 percent of first-time e-wallet users were motivated by
promotions, especially for online taxis and food delivery services.

One of the weird things about being a mother is witnessing the casual
sexism of the schoolyard - and how it can somehow become a marker of
your own uncoolness when you snort at it.

First there were the "your mum" or "yo mama" jokes which are still a
mark of social currency in our neighbourhood. Like: "Your mum's so
stupid she puts lipstick on her forehead to make up her mind. Your mum's
so stupid, she stared at a carton of apple juice for 12 hours because it
said concentrate."
