If you think plaid’s boring you might want to check yourself. This is
the season for thinking outside the square about checks, which are
anything but beige this autumn. Although, like beige, plaid’s a neutral
that can be worn with any colour including autumnal shades.

Energy drinks brand Runa has been reformulated, with an associated
rebrand highlighting the new limit of ten calories per can.

The six-strong range, unveiled by brand owner All Market late last week,
retains its natural caffeine source, the Guayusa leaf from Ecuador. The
reduction in the calorie content is a result of All Market's discovery
that *Millenial* consumers in the US, Runa's only current market, are on
the look-out for lower calories when making their energy source choices.

Commercial landlords swept up in coworking and open office trends have
not lost sight on the importance of physical office space in
accommodating the millennial consumer. Architects, landlords, and
tenants alike note that millennials, as well as their younger cohort
Gen-Z, are more transient than previous generations and because of that
need flexible work accommodations. However, both groups also desire an
office setting to plug-in for longterm career confidence, according to a
recent Deloitte survey on workplace flexibility.

LONDON: Firms and governments must increasingly internalise the
possibility – indeed, I would argue, the overwhelming probability – of
an acceleration of four secular developments that influence what
business and political leaders do and how they do it.

Decision-makers should think of these trends as waves, which, especially
if they occur simultaneously, could feel like a tsunami for those who
fail to adapt their thinking and practices in a timely manner.

With a myriad of indi-rock bands out there in the musical world what
better way, when starting a new band, to capture instant attention and
interest than give yourself a unique, somewhat abstract name, one that
no-one else is ever likely to think of, such as - 'Roobs and the Washing
Line Economy'.

No doubt the four members of the band are frequently asked the
derivation of their name and for those who may have wondered but never
asked, Roobs is the nickname of the band's founder and former Esperance
local, Robin Bottrell who came up with the name when, in his first share
house, he found only a small space left on the Hills Hoist to hang his
clothes and five pegs with which to attach them. While pondering his
predicament he wondered to himself, "What could I call this situation?"
and Roobs and the Washing Line Economy was born.

Along with her sharp lyricism and quirky personality, Doja
Cat[https://www.instagram.com/dojacat/] has captured the attention of
the music world with her daring sense of style. The Los Angeles rapper’s
eye for unorthodox looks that proudly puts her curves on display — as
seen in her recent ';70s disco-inspired “Say So”
video[https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/9324399/doja-cat-say-so-video]
— has transformed her into one of fashion’s newest stars.

Doja discovered her love for fashion around age 9, when she used to
create her own magazines with stapled computer paper and dress in her
mother’s clothes. “I would get in trouble for s–t that I would wear at
school,” she tells Billboard. “I was once sent home for putting glitter
on my face — it was so crazy. I didn';t give a s–t about school; all I
cared about was wearing a cool outfit every day, dancing and music.”

WASHINGTON — Members of IfNotNow, a group that opposes Israel's military
occupation, are used to being called fringe and anti-Semitic. What's
unfamiliar is having major presidential candidates publicly agree with them.

The 2020 campaign is the first time top contenders — Sens. Bernie
Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. — have boycotted the
massive American Israel Public Affairs Committee policy conference, a
signature event on the American Jewish calendar.

GOING DARK: THE SECRET SOCIAL LIVES OF EXTREMISTS JULIA EBNER MOST of
Going Dark: The Secret Social Lives of Extremists plays out online.
Assuming a variety of identities, Julia Ebner reports from the frontline
of far right messageboards, jihadi forums and anti-feminist communities,
in a thorough and shocking exploration of how the internet has
facilitated the spread of extremism. However, the book is the most
unsettling when Ebner shows the physical manifestation of online
extremism. Ebner, who by day is a senior research fellow at the
Institute for Strategic Dialogue, visits a neo Nazi music festival and
goes undercover at a right meeting in a London pub. If those events are
unsettling, then more harrowing is when Ebner's research demonstrates
how online extremism can transform into real world violence that readers
will recognise from recent news headlines. Ebner depicts the vast and
rapid spread of online extremism, and the challenge we face in fighting it.

‘Bourgeois’ style is the designer obsession du jour in Paris, referenced
this week by Anthony Vaccarello at Saint
Laurent[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/paris-fashion-week/saint-laurent-borrows-margaret-thatchers-wardrobe-twist-kink/]
and Olivier Rousteing at
Balmain[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/paris-fashion-week/duchess-coats-supermodel-comeback-loewe-balmain-bringing-back/].
But on Friday evening, Celine’s Hedi Slimane reminded us that it was he
who ushered in this style era (in his second Celine collection a year
ago) in which the epitome of elegance is to dress like the chicest maman
in St Germain. That is why there have been so many pussy bow blouses and
tea dresses gracing the rails of Zara lately.

It takes a lot to get noticed. Joseph Galbo knows that.

As Thanksgiving approached last year and he needed to let homeowners
know about the dangers of unattended cooking, Galbo took to Twitter and
posted a photoshopped image of an oven-roasted turkey ... holding a lit
match.

ZARA TINDALL'S children Mia and Lena will likely play a role in Princess
Beatrice's wedding this year, thanks to the close Royal Family bond.

Princess Beatrice could have Zara Tindall's children play a part in her
upcoming wedding day this year, thanks to the close relationship of the
Royal Family's *millenial* members. The couple's ceremony takes place in
May, and could see a cast of the Royal Family's youngest constituents
involved.

Gone are the days when a woman would wait to be presented with a big
diamond sparkler as her loved one popped the question. Now, rich
coloured gems are taking centre stage and women are doing the choosing.
By Sarah Royce-Greensill

Prepare for the onslaught of `he put a ring on it #engaged' Instagram
posts: yesterday was the most popular day of the year to pop the
question seeing an estimated 36 per cent of all proposals. For newly
engaged couples, the fun starts now: a months-long quest for the details
that'll make their big day unique, from personalised wedding favours to
inside-joke table names. I should know: I'm one of them. But for the
majority of soon-tobe-weds, one element remains the same: the diamond
ring on the bride-to-be's finger.

LIC Housing Finance has referred 14 projects to the Alternative
Investment Fund (AIF) set up by the government last year to revive
unfinished real estate projects.

“We have assessed 14 projects. We have advised those developers to be in
touch with SBICAP Ventures so that they can get some funding. That
process has started,” said Siddhartha Mohanty, Managing Director and
CEO, LIC Housing Finance. According to Mohanty, the projects are
estimated at about Rs. 1,000 crore to Rs. 1,100 crore. LIC Housing
Finance was the sole financier for the projects as it does not do joint
lending.

There is something undeniably romantic about a bar: dim lighting,
intimate seating encouraging you to get close and a glass of liquid
courage helping your pre-date jitters melt away.

It's no surprise that going out for drinks is one of the most common
activities suggested on dating apps. "If you love whiskey as much as I
do, swipe right," "Just looking for someone to get wine drunk with,"
"Wanna grab drinks?"

The level of dynamism of today is such that it is very difficult to keep
up with changes in our environment. Globalisation and the introduction
of technology to the very minute details of our everyday lives means
that the world is becoming more complicated in such a way that people
could very easily be left behind if they are not ahead of new and
innovative developments.

Farmers are a rare breed – one that likes to spend all hours working and
then spend any free time talking about, learning about and watching how
other people in the industry do their job.

Fortunately, this indulgence is getting even easier with the upsurge in
popular and good-quality agriculture YouTube channels that aim to
entertain farmers and non-farmers alike.

The Grammy Awards get more anticipated with every passing year, from the
unforgettable performances (including Demi Lovato's comeback, Tyler, The
Creator's earth-shattering delivery and the Nipsey Hussle tribute) to
surprise guests.

For the 2020 ceremony in Los Angeles on Sunday night (Jan. 26), the
celebrities not only stepped up their game on the Staples Center's stage
-- but also on the red carpet.

Aside from teaching hook steps, dance workshops now help students create
slick videos for social media.

On a recent Sunday morning, around 100 young women and a handful of men
dressed in shorts, neon dancing tights and vibrant athleisure clothing
collected at a dance studio in Andheri, at 11 am. They were there for a
three-hour workshop on mastering the dance moves to "Garmi", the hot
single from Street Dancer 3D, featuring Nora Fatehi and Varun Dhawan.
Hosted by Team Naach, which features dance duo Nicole Concessao (30) and
Sonal Devraj (29), the workshop takes participants through a minute-long
dance routine. They are also filmed while giving their newly-acquired
moves a go. Devraj explains, "The trouble with breaking down a song into
two classes is that if one misses a class, the entire routine appears a
waste. So we compressed it into one for convenience."

Jan 23 (Reuters) - Colgate-Palmolive Co said on Thursday it would buy
Hello Products LLC, a company which bills itself as a maker of
eco-friendly and animal cruelty-free toothpastes, in a push to tap into
a growing base of environmentally conscious consumers.

Hello Products, founded in 2009, sells various lines of vegan
toothpastes and mouthwashes, some which are infused with hemp seed oil -
another benefit for Colgate as demand for products based on cannabis
derivatives grows.

Davos, Switzerland (dpa) - Social problems and conflicts are the biggest
concerns for the generation that was born at the end of the past
millennium - not climate change - according to an international survey
by the Red Cross.

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) presented the poll,
conducted among 16,000 people between the ages of 20 and 35, on the
sidelines of the World Economic Forum.

During the summer season of radio, I did a session on Radio National
talking about “Millennial and Gen Z speak”, the new “language” of the
young that those of us born “a while ago” find puzzling and sometimes
confronting. Since then I’ve been receiving a steady flow of emails
requesting information as people missed part of the chat.

Well, buckle up folks because some of the language is just odd, while
some is rude and other parts a bit confronting. Let’s first define
“*Millenial*” and a “Gen Z” people shall we? Authorities agree that
Millennials were born in the period 1981–1996 inclusive.

TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - State-Owned Enterprises Minister Erick Thohir said
that in addition to changing the composition of Garuda Indonesia's board
of directors, he would also replace the airline's commissioners. Last
year, Erick Thohir fired CEO Ary Askhara in relation to the smuggling of
a Harley Davidson bike into Indonesia using the airline's new A330-900
Neo aircraft.

Speaking at the Indonesia *Millenial* Summit 2020 this morning, January
17, Minister Erick said he will appoint new people as president director
and chief commissioner. He declined to name who those people are.

*HD* 	Watch Camila Cabello Bury James Corden in a 1999 Vs. 2019 Riff-Off

When will James Corden ever learn? It seems like every time he gets all
nostalgic for how music used to be, some huge pop star bum-rushes him
with The Filharmonic to lay a vocal smackdown on the Late Late Show
host. On Thursday night (Jan. 16) it was Camila Cabello's turn to put
Corden in his place. The Cats star gushed about the good old days of
2009, when music was king, blathering on and on about Lou Bega's "Mambo
No .5," Christina Aguilera's "Genie in a Bottle," TLC's "No Scrubs" and
all the other wall-to-wall smashes in the year that Camila was still in
diapoers.

"How many songs from this year will hold up and people will remember in
20 years time?" Corden bloviated, running off just a handful of songs
folks might remember in 2040: Lizzo's "Juice" and Billie Eilish's "Bad
Guy" among them. And that's it. Cabello begged to differ, busting out
from backstage to remind the non-plussed talker that she makes music today.

The FAFSA form asks men whether they’ve signed up for Selective Service

The acronym “FAFSA” trended on social media in recent days as some
students who recently completed the Free Application for Federal Student

eligible to be drafted into the military.
