2019 MAR 2 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at
Leisure & Travel Week -- Investigators discuss new findings in
Hospitality Management. According to news reporting from Hat Yai,
Thailand, by VerticalNews journalists, research stated, "This study
examines how corporate social responsibility (CSR) participation affects
organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) through meaningful work. This
work is significant for three reasons: the joint examination of CSR,
meaningful work, and OCB is novel; the comparative effects of CSR
perception versus CSR participation have not been examined previously;
and this is the first examination of such relationships for different
generations of employees."

Financial supporters for this research include Thailand Research Fund

*Generation Y*, or Millennials, are born between 1979-1995 and represent
approximately 80 million people in the country. Millennials are the
fastest-growing demographic in the workplace, so chances are you have
several in your company. Millennials are much different to work with
than Gen Xer’s and Baby Boomers. We often hear that millennials are
“tech-savvy” but it is worse — they are tech-dependent.

If your organization is not giving your Millennial workers the software
tools they depend upon, they will toggle the open-for-recruiters button
on LinkedIn to search for a new job. What’s worse is they will do it on
the company internet you pay for. To not let it get to that point, here
are four software solutions that you must adopt if you want your
Millennials to become valuable, loyal and high-performing contributors.

Polity – the voters who elect the body politic, based on its proposed
policies. Policy – what political candidates propose to do, to deal with
pressing economic, social, and defense challenges.

What happens in democracies, when we the voters, the polity, cast our
ballots without any clue about what those we are voting for plan to do?
What if those we vote for have no idea themselves what they plan to do?
And why are Israel and Western democracies in this pickle? In the US,
politics are stalemated by an epic battle between President Donald Trump
and the Democrats over Trump’s obsession to build a border wall. In
fiscal 2018, the federal government spent $4.11 trillion, 20% of GDP.
Yet Trump’s request for $8 billion for his wall, or 0.2% of the total
budget, has become the focal issue – and may again shut down the government.

Qantas boss Alan Joyce has stepped up his feud with Perth Airport, using
a speech yesterday to claim that high airport charges were impeding the
airline’s growth and prosperity.

Addressing The West Australian’s Leadership Matters event at Crown
Ballroom, Mr Joyce celebrated the first year of the Perth-to-London
direct route, which he said was the most successful in the national
carrier’s 99-year history.

With voting day for the 2019 general elections only three weeks away,
the presidential candidates have started to ramp up their campaign
efforts, targeting young voters who they hope will show up to the
polling stations on April 17.

Making up nearly half of the electorate, millennial voters have been
prioritized by the Joko "Jokowi" Widodo-Ma'ruf Amin and Prabowo
Subianto-Sandiaga Uno campaign teams since the early campaign days.

(PRWeb) - In 2016, Millennials (*Generation Y*) began to surmount the
obstacles, like slow earnings growth, a weak labor market and soaring
student loan debt, that sat between them and homeownership. Since the
2016 turnaround, homeownership in the under-35 and 35-to-45 age groups
has rapidly increased. Zillow Research economist Aaron Terrazas recently
commented on this trend, saying, Millennials have been on a buying spree
the last few years.

Millennials are also becoming the largest consumer demographic on the
market, overtaking baby boomers. And according to the consumer advocacy
group Smart Grid Consumer Collaborative (SGCC), millennials are very
eager to take advantage of new energy technologies compared to
non-millennials. This is good news for the solar industry.

and that we are the children in that family and the people in
Washington, D.C., are the assumed technocratic parents of the family?

Do you sense that they are currently demonstrating that unless their

Teens whose face time with friends is mostly on their phones are the
loneliest of all, but even those who mix real-world socializing with
social media still are increasingly isolated, a report out Wednesday shows.

Loneliness isn't just an age thing; it's generational, says the author
of the study, San Diego State University psychology professor Jean
Twenge. The percent of high school seniors who said they often felt
lonely increased from 26 percent in 2012 to 39 percent in 2017.

"Experiences over things" is a mantra many millennials embrace, but a

Scottish Labour's plan to give free bus travel to the under-25s means
Millennials will get to experience the joys of the bus run', writes

Lukewarm on the heels of a host of vote-winning stuff from the SNP such
as scrapping prescriptions and tuition fees, Scottish Labour leader
Richard Leonard wants to extend free bus travel to the under 25s.

By now, millennials are growing accustomed to getting blamed for pretty
much everything. The end of marriage, the end of divorce, the end of sex
and the end of relationships; the demise of cinema and the rise of PC
culture. The list goes on. But it's in the culinary world that
*Generation Y* suffers the most virulent accusations.

Everything from the decline of
pubs[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/food-and-drink/pubs-and-bars/clean-living-millennials-really-blame-death-pub-culture/]
to the end of tuna is routinely laid at the hands of those born between
1981 and 1996. The latest grumble concerns HP Sauce. According to a poll
by luxury hotel chain Guoman Hotels, just 14 per cent of 16 to
24-year-olds (most of whom, it should be noted, are not millennials but
Generation Z), would select the condiment as their favourite Full
English accompaniment. The number for older generations was 26 per cent.

Co-living startup Homigo appears to be in trouble, as do its tenants.
YourStory followed up after receiving emails from them, and here's what
we found.

In 2014, like any new comer in the city, IIT Kanpur alumnus Nikunj
Batheja was faced with the problem of finding a furnished home in
Bengaluru. There was born the idea for Homigo, to help others like him.
The startup was launched in 2015, along with batchmate Jatin Mitruka as
Co-founder.

If you want to know about Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle, it states
that the more the position of a particle is determined, the less
precisely its speed and direction can be known. Or the sinking of the
Bismarck? Its guns were calibrated to shoot down any hostile plane which
was doing 125 mph or more. But the British had Swordfish biplanes which,
with a full load, barely made it to 85 mph, and reached their target.

And perhaps you wonder why the tax year starts on April 5?

l So it's "*Generation Y* do I have to earn a living?". A new study
suggests that millennials are, by and large, useless at working.
One-third of them fail to last 90 days in a new job.

According to the author of the report, Geoff Weiss, their most common
failings are regular underperformance, being late or absent and scoring
spectacular own goals. Weiss offers advice for companies employing these
awful people. This probably involves stroking them affectionately from
time to time and sympathising with them about how horrible the world is.
Thank God they don't have the energy to make it to the polling booths.

Do you remember Morgellons disease? It was all the rage a few years ago,
popular with people like me who take the Bizarre Diseases Quarterly
magazine and log into websites called stuff like “How the Zionist
Occupation Government Is Trying to Kill You”.

The talented old folkie Joni Mitchell had Morgellons, so she said:
“Fibres in a variety of colours protrude out of my skin like mushrooms
after a rainstorm: they cannot be forensically identified as animal,
vegetable or mineral.”

What is the difference between Generation X, Y and baby boomers?

Generations are a group of people who were born around the same time and
place - though the exact dates for when each generation starts and
another ends are uncertain.

A THIRD of millennials may never own a home and face more barriers to
ownership than previous generations, a study claims. Half of *Generation
Y* - those aged between 23 and 38 - are likely to rent well into their
forties, it stated. Loans broker ABC Finance found that half of baby
boomers, people born between 1946 and 1965, had owned their own property
by the age of 30.

But spiralling house prices and rents cut this figure to 44 per cent for
Generation X, people born from 1966 to 1981. And it falls further to
just 28 per cent for *Generation Y*. Millennials must save for i ht d f
eight years and four months to put down a £42,836 deposit - 20 per cent
of the cost of an average two-bed house, which is currently £214,178. In
London, where buyers typically need £82,352, it will take 15 years and
11 months of saving on an average millennial wage of £25,920.

How expats and locals can work together for success

The expat experience in modern-day Myanmar is not all hearts and
flowers, as a number of foreigners and locals will attest. But a book
just released offers insight into how culture-clash can be avoided and
both “sides” in a business endeavour could thrive.

Everybody comes to a point, eventually, where the lustre of a new job or
an interesting workspace begins to wear off. Maybe you find yourself
more often sitting at your desk listlessly preparing the day's to-do
list or, even worse, avoiding your colleagues.

Clearly, this is not a good place to be.

Chairwoman Larson, Ranking Member Reed, and members of the Committee, my
name is Ilana Boivie, and I am a Research Economist for the
International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAMAW),
AFL-CIO. As someone who has devoted more than ten years to work on
issues related to retirement income for working Americans, I am pleased
to have this opportunity to testify on the importance of Social Security
in today's economy and to add the labor movement's voice to the
increasingly louder call for benefit expansion.

I am here today on behalf of both the IAMAW and labor's umbrella
organization, the American Federation of Labor and Congress of
Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO). The IAMAW represents some 600,000
active and retired members, in a wide variety of industries and
occupations. The IAM is also a proud member of the AFL-CIO, which
includes 54 other unions, and, together, we represent some 12.5 million
American workers.

'One day, people will look back and laugh at us all traipsing into an
office block for the nine-to-five life'

For many people the notion of working nine-to-five is as outdated as
clocking in and out for lunch. Workplaces around Greater Manchester are
taking a more fluid approach when it comes to flexible working.

I went to visit a friend last weekend. She's just moved into a new flat

see it. We did the usual: brief tour; a bottle of wine; some dinner. And
then we were off to find the local boozer. She's 23, I'm 27, the rest of
us somewhere in between, but we all had the same thing in mind: what
better way to spend a Saturday evening than with a few pints at the pub?
( And an excellent one at that, we
discovered[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/food-and-drink/pubs-and-bars/pineapple-london-nw5-pub-review/]
).

It was cosy, relatively affordable – for London – the atmosphere
buzzing, the soundtrack terrific. At least half the clientele were
millennials (members of what is also called *Generation Y*, roughly aged
between 22 and 37). The pub was full, as was every other watering hole
in the vicinity – and there are countless in that particular corner of
of the capital.

This study presents a literature review and an empirical research to
analyze the connection between self-congruity, perceived social value,
and use of social media by *Generation Y* tourists. To contrast the
hypotheses of the study, a quantitative research was carried out among
young Spanish travelers. As a result, 444 valid surveys were collected
during February of 2016. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to
estimate the connection between the constructs. The results show that
self-congruity leads to perceived social value and the use of virtual
social networks. In addition, perceived social value leads to
satisfaction, and satisfaction leads to revisit intention and positive
WOM. Finally, positive WOM intention influences the intensity of the use
of virtual social networks by *Generation Y* travelers. As a part of the
conclusions, the article presents the managerial implications of these
relationships.

At both events, I addressed issues around managing generational
differences and expectations. This is certainly a challenge for many
companies.

AS WE TREAD carefully forward the Indian ambition knows no limits. With
their planes claiming to conduct some kind of surgical strikes which was
nothing more than intrusion thwarted immediately. Such acts will yield
nothing but exposure of the ineffectiveness of Indian forces.

The intrusion is a result of the Pulwama drama. It's another episode of
house of cards . Come election time Mr. Modi wants to get re-elected .
Some million jobs, economic reform he promised the world to indians.
Unfortunately the world is precisely that is questioning stuff. This is
not the first time India has carried out a False Flag Operation. It's as
if we have the same theme over and over again.

Most of the Portuguese consider recycling and waste separation to be a
priority sector for Portuguese society (92%), ahead of energy (90%),
transport (89%) and banking (78%). This is a conclusion of the 1st
Permanent Observatory of Recycling Trends, an initiative promoted by the
"Novo Verde". When questioned about the separation of waste, 84% of
Portuguese respond affirmatively, pointing to the preservation of the
environment as the one that most motivates them (97%). As for the age
groups more attentive to this reality, the generation between the ages
of 37 and 57 stands out. The second group with the most weight in the
national recycling volume is *generation Y* (22-36 years). Of the young
people under 21, only 8.5% say they recycle.

lifestyle, millennials comprise the population group in the 18-35 years

advisers in the best possible position for future growth, explains Abbie
Knight

Over the next 30 years, £5.5 trillion is expected to be transferred
between generations in the UK, according to the Centre for Economics and
Business Research (CEBR). This amount is unprecedented and presents both
an opportunity and a threat to the financial advice sector.

Loyalty and longevity in employment are disappearing as quickly as
outdoor payphones across Canada.

A recent massive national study, which looked at seven million work
histories of Canadians, showed that younger workers are increasingly
likely to hop from not only one employer to another but also to change
actual careers at a rate that would have stunned their parents.

Knowing where their food comes from, how it was raised and all the rest
is becoming less of an option and more of a deal-breaker with consumers.

“Consumer demand for more transparency and a sense of connection to
where their food is grown or produced continues to have a significant
impact on food supply chains,” according to a recent report from
CoBank’s Knowledge Exchange Division. “At the retail level, customers
are looking for labels that indicate farm management practices.”

Homeowners looking to add personality and individuality to their home
are more likely to undertake a do it yourself remodel than hire a
professional, according to the National Association of Realtors'2019
Remodeling Impact Report: DIY. The report also shows that cash-strapped
millennials are the most likely of any generation to take on a DIY project.

The report examines the differences between remodeling when hiring a
professional compared to homeowners who pursue "do it yourself"
projects. The report also differentiates between projects that were
undertaken to benefit the homes of consumers and those that benefit
consumers' pets.

True or not, one of the impressions I have of my grandmother's era is
that life was simpler then. It was less genetically modified, and more
wholesome. It was homemade bread and butter, and meat and potatoes, but
people were healthier because they didn't have computers and smartphones
zapping their lives - that's my inkling. My perception is the less
genetically modified foods they ate were better than the corn syrup and
diet sodas of our day, and my grandmother's group didn't have the health
problems we now face. For some reason, that's the perception I have,
notwithstanding the fact that my grandmother died from complications
with cancer before I was born. Somehow, the idea that everything was
farm-to-table - and better - in my grandmother's day still hovers, even
though her own cookbook calls for gelatin and lard and tins of Spam for
a regular Sunday meal.

You have until March 1 to put money into a registered retirement savings
plan and get a refund on your 2018 income taxes.

I'm a believer. After opening an RRSP in my 20s, I made regular
contributions and learned how to invest in the stock market with a
financial adviser at one of Canada's bank-owned brokerages.

THE Karebosi stadium in Makassar united Sandiaga Salahuddin Uno and the
Sabyan Gambus group on one stage for the first time on Saturday three
weeks ago. In front of thousands of people attending the ‘Grand
Get-Together with a Million Stars’ event, the running mate of
presidential candidate Prabowo Subianto praised the group’s lead
vocalist Khoirunnisa.

Sandiaga said he was touched by Khoirunnisa’s songs, such as Deen
Assalam, which has over 200 million YouTube views. “This goes across
ethnicity, people and religions. I am moved to hear the lyrics in
Sabyan’s beautiful voice,” Sandiaga said.

Receiving a birthday or ­Christmas present should make us feel special.

The ­giver has spent time thinking about what present to buy. This in
itself is not an easy task. The sender has to think about what is
appropriate, the context and what they feel we would like. Then they go
through the process of purchasing the present, wrapping it and writing
up a card personal to us. It takes time, thought and energy to shape up
the perfect present. But more and more we are seeing this ritual
disappear as many of us opt for cash instead of the joy of bursting open
wrapping paper.

these schools provide for under $10,000 in tuition and fees. As demand
has intensified, admission has become increasingly competitive.

up 7.1 percent from the 35,313 applications received for 2017 and 24.8
percent from 30,300 applications five years earlier.

Among the top 10 most-chosen fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) brands in
Vietnam by sector in 2018, as revealed by Kantar Worldpanel, beer brand
Tiger ranks third and is considered an affordable premium brand able to
ride the up-trading wave in the country’s beer market. It also promotes
a lot of social activities and activations that target Millennials or
*Generation Y* (born between 1982 and 2004) in Vietnam, in the hope of
capturing this rising consumer base. Representing 35 per cent of
Vietnam’s population, the group are key customers in Vietnam’s FMCG
market as they are the shopping generation of the future.

People born in the year 2000 will turn 19 this year, entering university
or finding jobs in a society struggling with slowing economic growth and
a rapidly declining population. But as Korea adapts to a difficult
economic environment, how will this new generation that prioritizes
personal experiences and online communities fit in?

The generation, known as Generation Z, follows the millennial
generation, *Generation Y*, and refers to those born in the late ’90s
and early 2000s.

The large poster of a woman whose mouth is coated with chocolate is
difficult to miss. The tagline says: "We create delicious moments of joy".

But before Mondelez India's Cadbury Dairy Milk can spread that joy, the
chocolate, milk, sugar and nuts must all be put together, and the bars
formed. Machines, not men, make what you eat. In fact, machines control
nearly every process, even wrapping, packing, storing and dispatching
the chocolate bars.

Ten years ago, faced with mass bankruptcies and the very real prospect
of a re-run of the Great Depression, the US Federal Reserve took the
fateful decision to unveil a new policy called "quantitative easing" or QE.

This anniversary may seem unimportant but it should be commemorated
because the policy of QE arguably changed - or will change - politics
more profoundly than almost any other event or policy initiative in the
past decade.

IN Australia there are now more people born since 1980 than before 1980.
This means that *Generation Y* (born from 1980 to 1994), Generation Z
(born from 1995 to 2009) and Generation Alpha (born since 2010) comprise
more than half of the population.

The year 2019 is also a milestone year because Generations Y and Z now
comprise the majority of the workforce – outnumbering Generations X and
the Baby Boomers for the first time.

How Insurtechs Can Help Attract Millennial Talent to Agencies, Carriers

The rules of the game are changing for companies wishing to attract top,
young, qualified talent. Millennials, *Generation Y*, Gen Next,
Boomerang Generation, or whatever label 20- and 30-years-olds receive,
have very different ideas about what they want from their employers.
Many will sacrifice salary for more freedom in working schedules and the
right culture. They see through insincere messages and over-rehearsed
corporate speeches. They want to be part of something and able to
contribute to a company's larger vision. For insurance — which has long
been viewed as a traditional industry — appealing to this demographic
can be difficult.

[Generation Z]

The Pew Research Center, a nonprofit group that specializes in measuring
public opinion across demographic groups, recently announced that it had
settled on what to call the "post-millennial" generation born from about
1997 to 2012. Taking its cue from popular usage, Pew will apply the
label "Generation Z," or "Gen Z" for short.

The launch of a disruptive new investment platform which is the first of

artificial intelligence and transparency to help *Generation Y* and Gen
Z users build their best investment portfolio. His portfolio includes
previous investments in prominent blockchain startups, Ethereum and EOS.

same tools and opportunities as the super wealthy. Roobee aggregates
various investment instruments from different markets and provides
retail investors with instant access to them at zero fees for buying
investment products - all for a stake as low as $10.

In response to those who will face higher taxes under Labor’s proposed
changes to Australia’s dividend imputation system, Bowen said they were
“entitled to vote against us”.
