Impossible not to remember All for a Dream (1995) through Nicole
Kidman's portrayal of Gretchen Carlson in The Scandal, a film that opens
on Friday on the eve of the Oscars. If in Gus Van Sant's already classic
film, in turn inspired by a real case, Kidman was a true fatal woman
willing to succeed as a TV host, here's Carlson, the veteran Fox &
Friends hostwhot who decided she had paid an inadmissible price to be
where she was and took legal letters on the matter. In 2016, before the
Weinstein scandal erupted, Carlson's allegation of sexual abuse against
Roger Ailes (a disturbing and nuanced John Lithgow in The Scandal)
provoked a chain reaction from Fox News employees who had gone through
the same thing. It all ended with the departure of the director and
founder, who took a $40 million check as a sic in his pocket. He
couldn't enjoy them too much, because he passed away the following year.

Nearly 24 hours delayed the first results by a "code error" in the app
for counting votes.With 62% of the count, *millennial* Peter Buttigieg
is 26.9%.Nearly 24 hours of chaos and uncertainty were the consequence
of confusion and problems in the count of the Democratic Party caucus in
Iowa, in the first internal election to elect rival Donald Trump, in the
November election.

The first official results were only released yesterday afternoon and
showed that *millennial* and Afghanistan war veteran Peter Buttigieg,
37, was imposed – with 62 percent of the count – with 26.9 percent,
followed by the experienced Bernie Sanders, with 25.1 percent; Elizabeth
Warren, with 18, 3 percent, and former Vice President Joe Biden, with
15.6 percent.

These days we're talking about a new pandemic. We did this in recent
times because of Ebola, SARS, MERS, influenza or Zika alerts, to name a
few. While the development of these epidemics has been controlled and
their damage softened, there is consensus among epidemiologists and
health organs that the possibility of a pandemic is approaching. This is
not the result of a *millennial* curse or divine warning, but as a
product of natural biological cycles. Understanding where we are and how
we will deal with the issue is important.

Millennials are probably the majority of demographics today. The world
should be in your hands and our destiny, falling on your shoulders. But
no, except for Salvadoran Nayib Bukele, Austrian Sebastian Kurz and
Korean Kim Jong Un, gerontocracy prevails everywhere. At the last
election in the US, Donald Trump fought Hillary Clinton, two
septuagenarians; and this year the American Representative will probably
be seen against someone his own age. Not surprisingly, biological age
never makes a political generation, but ideas that move in a given space
and time, in which 70-year-olds and 20-year-olds can easily coexist.

New Delhi, Feb. 5 -- A sustainable agenda, a secondary market strategy
and multi-sensorial experiences will be key for personal luxury brands
to stay relevant among the next generation of consumers A recent
conference by Swiss business magazine Bilan brought together business
leaders, designers, academics, consultants and bankers to take stock of
the sector, discuss sustainability and responsible luxury and analyse
the behaviour of the next generation of luxury consumers. The latest
True-Luxury Global Consumer Insight report by Boston Consulting Group
and Fondazione Altagamma values the global luxury industry at 920
billion Euros in 2018 and predicts continued growth to generate sales of
1.3 trillion Euros by 2025. The same report describes the behaviour and
buying habits of a key demographic: *millennial* and Gen Z consumers.
Let us take a critical look at the data and its impact on future
developments.

Mumbai, Feb. 5 -- The 2020 Budget was expected to provide an impetus for
greater job creation, coming as it did when the country was facing a job
crisis. Many analysts believe that this impetus hasn't materialized and
remain pessimistic about the job outlook. The budget documents suggest
that even the outlook on government jobs, the aspirational employment
for India's youth, is bleak. According to the 2020 budget, there will be
3.5 million union government employees in 2020-21, just a 0.7% increase
(or 24,000 jobs) over the current year. This is in line with the largely
stagnant public sector job growth over the last decade and an
improvement over the negative average growth (-0.4%) under the National
Democratic Alliance-II (NDA-II).

These figures are also likely to be over-estimates of the true extent of
government job creation. Governments over the years have consistently
failed to meet targets set in budget estimates.

American presidential contests traditionally kick off with a bizarre
event called a caucus in the small midwestern state of Iowa. This year,
things got weirder than ever

So the winner of the Iowa caucuses is … drum roll … President Donald
Trump. The Democratic Party imploded in its first test of the 2020
presidential election last night: Joe Biden collapsed as the Great White
Hope of the Democratic party and technical glitches engulfed the ­caucus
results.

Big alcohol brands are following, not leading. And where they are headed
is alternative drink categories, many of them "hard" versions of
nonalcoholic beverages.

Hard seltzer surpassed $500 million in sales in 2019, according to media
and consumer research firm Nielsen, growing more than 200% in 2019. It
took a bite out of light beer sales and contributed to a decline in the
volume of wine purchases in the United States, the first drop since
1994. For the Super Bowl, Bud Light debuted Bud Light Seltzer
commercials, a 5% alcohol beverage offered in four fruity flavors.
California wine giant Barefoot has made the biggest investment in its
55-year history to launch four white wine-based seltzers in the first
quarter of this year.

Like a lot of New Mexicans watching the legislative session closely, I
read with great interest Carla Sonntag's opinion in The New Mexican
about cannabis legalization ("Don't let New Mexico go up in smoke," My
View, Feb. 2). As a self-proclaimed voice of business, I fully expected
her to extol the 11,000 new jobs legalization is projected to create for
Southern New Mexico farmers and *millennial* entrepreneurs statewide.
Instead, she allowed her organization to fall victim to out-of-state
misinformation campaigns. Let's set the record straight.

The claims Sonntag cited about epic increases in crime and mayhem would
raise anyone's eyebrow, but they simply aren't true. Just ask the states
and agencies whose data they repackaged.

When he became Irish Taoiseach in 2017 Leo Varadkar had a sprinkle of
stardust. The gay, half Indian medical doctor was the changing face of
modern Ireland.

A year after taking office he oversaw the abolition of strict abortion
laws and on the international stage he bravely stood up to the British
over Brexit. All the while, the economy boomed.

rapidly disappearing among the elite

I think it was November 1990 that the rot first set in. During the
Conservative leadership campaign Douglas Hurd, sometime Foreign
Secretary, cast his eye across the scrutinising media and-dressed in
tweed jacket and tie-denied he was a toff.

Scott Hagie and his wife Beth always knew they wanted to expand their
family through
adoption[https://www.benefitnews.com/opinion/family-planning-benefits-are-growing-up-fast],
and a $5,000 adoption benefit from their company Unum helped chip away
at the list of expenses associated with the costly process.

“Pretty much everything costs money, from forms that have to be
submitted to having fingerprints done, travel and hotels,” says Hagie, a
benefits manager at Unum. “We knew about the $5,000 benefit and Unum was
very supportive. The adoption benefit allows employees to be able to
grow their family as they see fit.”

AUDIE CORNISH: We finally have results coming in from yesterday's Iowa
caucuses. After holding a press conference where the state party
chairman apologized for disruptions to the process, Iowa Democrats have
released results from nearly two-thirds of precincts in the state. And
it's a very close race between Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders. NPR
political correspondent Scott Detrow joins us now with more.

Scott, first, help us understand these results. As we said, it's just
two-thirds of the precincts, so what are we looking at?

Millennials, the oft-referenced generation born in the ’80s and ’90s,
are the first generation to have access to the internet in their youth
and are the largest and most diverse generation in American history. Now
for the first time, Millennials are running for US president: Pete
Buttigieg and Tulsi Gabbard were born in 1982 and 1981 respectively,
putting them at the upper limit of the *Millennial* range.

The 2019 Chicago Council Survey data provide insight into how this group
views key foreign policy issues compared with previous generations.
While there is some evidence that younger Americans are more hesitant to
engage in the world and more likely to oppose the use of force than
their elders, time will tell whether the post-Cold War and 9/11
experiences have shaped a new generation with enduring preferences for a
more restrained, less military-focused foreign policy.

Thomas is a certain type of romantically tragic man whose brand of
damage attracts sympathetic young women like catnip.

He’s scarred and haunted by an incident from his youth. He's an art
school dropout and occasional substitute keyboardist in a band. Despite
always being kind of lousy to women, he’s always lousy with options.
He’s a parade’s worth of red flags, distant and unavailable and always
on the verge of flickering out of existence.

JUCHITON, Oax., February 4.- The Oaxaca Health Services (SSO) have
detected five cases of leprosy in Oaxacan territory, all in the Isthmus
of Tehuantepec. This *millennial* condition is a disease that is no
longer considered a public health problem in Mexico. It is
infecto-contagious in nature, caused by Mycobacterium leprae, which
affects the skin and peripheral nerves. If not diagnosed and treated
early, it can cause serious disabilities.

In an intentional search by Health Jurisdiction number 2 of the
Tehuantepec Isthmus, five new cases of leprosy were detected in this
region, which are already being treated for healing. To this day all
cases dealt with by health authorities have been successful.

There are many ways in which we can define who millennials are. Some
describe them for their innate connection with technology, their
openness towards different cultures or willingness to explore unique
experiences. They have been at the forefront of disrupting the
traditional way of life at multiple levels, including the business
ecosystem of India. With their unconventional approach, more number of
millennials are embracing creative and offbeat professions which allow
them to follow their passion and also make a living out of the same. Let
us look at some of the occupations which never existed before a
*millennial* thought about them!

*Millennial* generations are changing the way they consume in all
industries, and financial is no exception.

According to this study, millennials' consumption expectations are
radically different from any previous generation; for example, 71% of

Malayalam superstar Mohanlal is all praise for this aged couple! Not
just that, the 'Lucifer' actor hosted the couple at his residence,
referring to them as an 'inspiration to all'. In Mohanlal's posts on
social media, the actor shared a candid image with the popular
travelling couple, Vijayan and Mohana Vijayan. Also known as Kerala's
'travelling couple', they worked doubly hard and earned money by running
their Sri Balaji Coffee house at Kochi's Gandhinagar to pursue their
love for travel.

As of now, they have visited more than 25 countries. In fact, they are
known to lead a very simple and minimalistic life in order to go on
these trips abroad.

At 50, Sheryl Sandberg has *millennial* customs. Or maybe it's just a
corporate issue. Because the powerful executive, number two on Facebook,
has used the social network Instagram, the most used by the
twenty-year-olds and thirtysomethings, to announce their engagement.
Nearly five years after being widowed, Mark Zuckerberg's right-hand man
remarries.

Maybe we can do a better job of reducing food waste if we start
rebranding it as a waste of money.

A recent
article[http://www.canadiangrocer.com/blog/talk-about-a-waste-of-food-91881]
by food industry expert Sylvain Charlebois says the average consumer
throws away an estimated 170 kilograms of food a year, which is getting
into the zone of what a piano weighs. Some of this waste is out of our
hands – planned meals don’t come together and fresh food goes bad in the
fridge as a result. But we’re also buying too much at the grocery store.
That seems obvious.

Younger workers are 4 times more likely than baby boomers to expect hard
job advancements such as promotions and pay raises every year, according
to a new survey report by Clutch, the leading B2B ratings and reviews
firm. Clutch surveyed 505 full-time employees in the U.S. to learn their
opinions about and experiences with advancing at work.

For younger workers, regularly advancing at work is especially important

Parents with adult children are tightly linked financially, new research
from home co-investing company Unison shows. The connections run deepand
in some cases, their children threatening parents' retirement plans.

Unison CEO Thomas Sponholtz said, "Of course parents want to help their
children, but it's worrisome that so many are putting their own
retirement security at risk by doing so, especially considering that
most American baby boomers are already severely undersaved for their own
retirement. These results are yet another example that we need to
present consumers with new solutions that enable to buy and own homes
while meeting their other financial goals, including a secure retirement."

"You understand less than Chinese." More than ever we have heard this
phrase when someone does not understand another person's lyrics or a bad
pronunciation, alluding to the classic characters of a language that
more than 19 thousand kilometers away from Chile seems so difficult to
learn. But it's not.

With a history of more than 4,000 years (Spanish is 1,400 years old),
Mandarin Chinese is the official language of the People's Republic of
China. An original Beijing dialect ("Northern Capital") which, according
to official statistics, is the most spoken language in the world. Like
other languages, such as Spanish, it has its own accents and words,
especially when spoken in a country with 23 provinces and 56
ethnicities. Mandarin Chinese is not the dialect of Beijing, but a
common language of the Chinese nation, has the standard pronunciation of
the Beijing dialect, and is based on the dialects of northern China.

In September of 2016, Milwaukee entrepreneur Kiley Peters launched
Brainchild Studios, a digital marketing and website creation startup
designed to help companies market their products and services to female
consumers.

After revisiting her business plan, Peters, a Marquette University
graduate, decided a marketing service catering to all women consumers
was too broad. A marketing focus on the *millennial*-aged woman,
specifically mothers, she thought, was more relatable to her and
potential clients.

Andy Samberg time-loop comedy “Palm Springs” broke sales records (by the

be and under my leadership, will be located,” MacKay, a front-runner in
the race for the CPC leadership, announced via Twitter on Tuesday.

As Gen Z, the generation born between 1997 and 2007, enters the
workforce and begins to gain spending power, data from Ernst & Young LLP
aims to arm companies with a better understanding of this new generation
as a consumer.

According to findings in the Gen Z Segmentation Study, “Gen Z is a
walking contradiction to society and past youth” in terms of
expectations toward social media, core values and politics.

The Spanish Jewelers Association showed its support for the firm Tous,
after the confusion that the media campaign is generating to the consumer.

"The *millennial* craft of jewelry and the high standards of
certification and quality to which the sector is subjected should not be

they point out in a statement.

Gen Z is growing up fast. With the older end of the “Zoomer” generation
now in their early- to mid-twenties, many are finishing their
undergraduate degrees and moving on to grad programs before trying their
luck in the workforce. Others are just beginning their college careers.

According to the Pew Research Center, the post-*millennial* generation
is on track to becoming the most educated yet. But with such a heavy
emphasis on higher education, one has to wonder how the current student
loan crisis will affect this demographic.

Recently, The Aesthetic Society published its 2020 predictions for
cosmetic medical treatments. This year promises to be historic for this
field, with innovations in non-surgical procedures, refinement of
established surgical procedures and a new generation entering the
market, according to the statement. But what are the trends for this
leap year?

The return of the liftingWhen it comes to facial rejuvenation,
injectable treatments improve, but do not replace surgical procedures.
According to specialists at The Aesthetic Society, patients understand
that the most effective, natural, durable and cost-effective treatment
remains cheek and neck lift, as long as it is well performed. But both
techniques complement each other and are used one or the other depending
on the case and the particular moment of each person.

platforms to seek out impact opportunities.

Online fundraising platforms and impact investing strategies have both
been earmarked as future disruptors of the private equity industry. It’s
therefore fitting that a growing number of organisations are combining
the two.

zigzag patterns. The THC-containing pre-rolls will debut during M
Missoni’s Feb. 4 event at L.A. landmark Pink’s Hot Dogs.

Although CBD products have been a mainstay in fashion show gift bags and
at events for several seasons, this partnership on psychoactive THC
products is the first of its kind between a luxury fashion house and a
cannabis brand. Pure Beauty is known for its stylish aesthetic; there’s
a whimsical set of eyeballs on each joint, and the cigarette-style boxes
are *Millennial* pink. The colorful M Missoni versions will be available
for purchase for a limited time at select dispensaries in California.

Millennials grew up online. From making their first screen names with
America Online in the ’90s and poking around chatrooms, to using HTML to
customize their Myspace pages in high school, and now curating their
Instagram feeds, navigating the internet is second nature to these
digital natives.

But this ever-online generation may be uniquely positioned as targets of

What is the Trojan horse of collectivist ethics? (Photo:
Flickr)Socialist ethics and doctrines built on them have found aside in
the West, both in philomarxist theological doctrines arising and spread
between orders and hierarchies of the Catholic Church, (as well as in
Protestant churches) even in the pseudoliteral interpretation of the
Bible, the extra biblical proclaimed revelation of the holy spirit,
sacred texts and teachings of teachers of Eastern religions, neopagan
syncretisms, hermetic-gnostic enlightenisms, illuminating rationalisms,
and prophetic materialisms and rigorously atheist dogmatics. The sources
cannot be more diverse, but all the variants of socialism of them
derived share the same moral criteria and the same impractical ethics;
they are therefore dogmatic ideologies in the sense that proclaim as
ultimate truth a model of social order affirming its superiority,
despite having no successful sideman in the *millennial* experience of
social evolution to sustain it.

maintained as it provided for and not 25 wages , as is in the current
law, allows a worker earning more than 50 thousand pesos per month to
receive a much lower pension.

FELTON, California, Feb. 4, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- The scope of the global
Craft Beer
Market[https://www.millioninsights.com/industry-reports/craft-beer-market?utm_source=prnewswire&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=prn_04Feb2020_craftbeer_rd1]
was appreciated at US$ 85.02 billion in 2015. The range is projected to
touch US$ 502.9 billion by 2025, growing at a CAGR of 19.9% for the
duration of the forecast.

This is attributed to increasing consumer base in the developing
economies like India; thanks to high disposable income and high
*millennial* population. It has been reported that millennials are all
the more enthusiastic with regards to trying out novel flavors and
variants as compared to the other section of population. Plus,
millennials' spending power is on the higher note and likely to increase
by leaps and bounds.

The generation that invented self-care has lost the instructions, with
four in five young Australians admitting to feeling overwhelmed by the
pressures of life.

Gone is the easygoing “Ferris Bueller” approach of the 1980s and faking
a sickie for some time on the couch.

the party picks could determine the country's future. Voting starts in

Why

Despite being the world's largest floating village and having been in
existence for more than a *millennial*, Kampong Ayer in Brunei's capital
has flown largely under the tourism radar. To educate visitors about
Brunei's historic settlement, the tourism board launched a Kampong Ayer
walking trail last May, giving visitors access to designated abodes
across five villages in the overwater city.

Rashie Jain, an alumni of IIT Kanpur, was leading a normal life until
cancer struck a family member in 2010, turning her life upside down.
Even after several years of experience in the healthcare ecosystem, she
had countless questions about the treatment.

“It was like being in the dark. There were too many questions such as
what to except from the treatment; what could be the side effects; what
should be the changes in the diet,” says Jain, who found the process
exhaustive and emotionally draining. The biotechnology engineer had seen
her husband run a start-up on the side, so she decided to build a
patient-facing platform for cancer care. Along with oncologist Amit
Jotwani, Jain started building a platform for oncology solutions and
thus Onco.com was born in 2017.

however, assured that the state had laid a plan of actions and
mechanisms that would ensure that as people begin to migrate from Lagos

quality education, quality healthcare, transportation, clean water and
clean power.”

business commentary Robert Lea

Three people in an Amsterdam bar talking about their trip from London.
The first says he's a flyer. The second says she took the Eurostar from
St Pancras because she could work the four hours on the train. But it'll
be the plane on the way home, as Dutch customs rules mean passengers
have to change trains in Brussels, making it a five-hour schlep back.

When the Duke of Cambridge rose to speak at the Baftas, few expected a
broadside on the lack of diversity. Is this just the start, asks Harry
Wallop

This year's Baftas ceremony was notable for two things. One was a speech
by a man who wasn't there: Brad Pitt's jokes about his divorce, Brexit
and Megxit were delivered by Margot Robbie on his behalf. "Hey, Britain,
heard you just became single — welcome to the club. Wishing you the best
with the divorce settlement," she said, adding, of the award: "He says
he is going to name this Harry because he is really excited about
bringing it back to the States with him. His words, not mine."

This year, it's all about blue. Classic Blue, to be exact.

While previous years have seen the rise of coral, mustard and
*Millennial* Pink, the callers of all things colour - Pantone - have
dubbed the shade 19-4052 Classic Blue as the hottest (ahem, or coolest)
colour of 2020.

The standup comic offered his opinion on more than one brand during the
course of his hour long Netflix special - this is how one brand responded.

Moment marketing was previously known as Amul's forte. In the 1960s,
Amul began punning on current events by putting up billboards with its
mascot the Amul Girl, generally commenting on a current, relevant,
timely social issue. This is the essence of moment marketing - to
capture a trend that's making news and make it relevant to the brand and
what it stands for - hence creating relevance with the audience too. An
advantage that brands like Amul didn't have back then is the presence of
social media. With the increasing reach and popularity of social media
in India, more and more brands are hopping on to the moment marketing
bandwagon. This includes the likes of Zomato, Indigo, Durex, with brands
like Hajmola and Dabur joining the fun.

Big alcohol brands are following, not leading. And where they are headed
is alternative drink categories, many of them "hard" versions of
nonalcoholic beverages.

Hard seltzer surpassed $500 million in sales in 2019, according to the
media and consumer research firm Nielsen, growing more than 200 percent
in 2019. It took a bite out of light beer sales and contributed to a
decline in the volume of wine purchases in the United States, the first
drop since 1994. For the Super Bowl, Bud Light debuted Bud Light Seltzer
commercials, a 5 percent alcohol beverage offered in four fruity
flavors. California wine giant Barefoot has made the biggest investment
in its 55-year history to launch four white wine-based seltzers in the
first quarter of this year.
