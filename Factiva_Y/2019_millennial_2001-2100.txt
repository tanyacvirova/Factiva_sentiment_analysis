The role of curiosity in a baby’s development is the Baby Einstein brand
story that toymaker Kids II Inc., wants today’s parents to embrace.

Baby Einstein started about 20 years ago as a DVD business of videos for
babies featuring classical music, language exposure, stories and
numbers. Kids II acquired the brand from Disney in 2013 and has expanded
it to include product offerings based on STEM (science, technology,
engineering and math).

Now that hemp is legal, analysts at Cowen & Co. expect the plant will
grow into a $16 billion opportunity for companies like Canopy Growth
Holdings (ticker:CGC), Tilray (TLRY), and the little tobacco product
seller Turning Point Brands (TPB) -- all stocks that Cowen already rates
as Outperform. The broker has led the way among U.S. firms in covering
cannabis, and Monday morning Cowen put out a 100-page report on hemp by
11 of its analysts.

Hemp is the cannabis cousin that contains cannabidiol, or CDB, but not
the stuff that makes you high, which is THC (or if you must,
tetrahydrocannabinol). In December, President Donald Trump signed a bill
that removed hemp from federal narcotics prohibitions and allows states
to regulate the product. That cleared the way for truckloads of consumer
products containing CBD, which has analgesic and relaxing effects, but
no buzz.

STATELY oil paintings were once an indicator of wealth and status, but
the daughter of Cabinet minister Amber Rudd claims the true mark of
social acceptability today is being immortalised in ceramics.

Flora Gill, 27, whose father was the late writer A.A. Gill, reveals she
has been portrayed nude on a plate by the artist Eliza Hopewell, 24, who
charges £500 a dish.

Sometimes the most momentous shifts in American life happen in plain
sight, but in such slow motion that they aren't fully appreciated until
complete.

Such a shift is happening right now with the country's two major
political parties. Both Republicans and Democrats are in the midst of --
and in fact, may be near the end of -- significant realignments that are
altering who they are and what they stand for.

Love it or loathe it, Nineties style footwear is going to be huge this
year, says KATIE WRIGHT

IT WAS bound to happen eventually. With the return of just about every
Nineties trend - from crop tops and chokers, to bucket hats and
backpacks - it was only a matter of time before square-toed shoes
stomped back into fashion.

HANOI - His intelligence chiefs warn that North Korea is unlikely to
surrender its nuclear weapons. His advisers fret that a breakthrough
could prove elusive and that he might make an impulsive concession to
score headlines. And his allies around the world worry he could easily
get outmaneuvered.

Yet, President Trump is steadfast in his determination to meet face to
face here this week with Kim Jong Un, aides say, because he has an
unwavering faith in the power of the pen-pal relationship he has
cultivated with the North Korean leader not only to bend the course of
history but to shape his own legacy.

TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - The campaign team of incumbent candidate Joko Widodo
or Jokowi puts a special concern on West Java province in the 2019
presidential election. Several surveys showed that Jokowi has high
electability in village areas, while in a bid to attract votes in urban
areas, the camp relies on West Java Governor Ridwan Kamil.

“Ridwan Kamil is assigned to gain *millennial* and mothers votes in
urban areas,” said Jokowi camp member Muradi last week to Tempo. The
campaign team also actively calls for support from Viking members, fans
of Bandung football club Persib.

News | KELNER'S VIEW

Ever since Sacheen Littlefeather went up to the podium to decline, on
behalf of Marlon Brando, the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1973 in
protest at Hollywood's depiction of Native Americans, the Academy Awards
has provided a stage for political expression of all sorts. So Spike
Lee's show of outrage about Green Book winning Best Picture this year
can be seen in the context that, if you're going to make a point, you
might as well do it when the world is watching.

Bezos's below-the-belt selfies made it to the headlines but for many
Indians, sharing racy photos is very much a part of the digital dating
ritual

Nidhi, 25, was in a longdistance relationship that, like many in the
smartphone era, involved some naked selfies or nelfies in

pictures. He would say things like, 'I miss you, but you aren't doing
anything about it to help me'," says Nidhi, who was studying in Europe
at that time.

* After 29-year-old Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's stunning upset against
Rep. Joe Crowley in the New York Democratic congressional primary in
June, the word "socialist" was repeatedly used to describe her.

* "Socialist" remains a dirty, and often misunderstood, term in the
realm of US politics.

New Delhi, Feb. 26 -- Imagine being at your office desk, vigorously
tapping keys on your keyboard to draft a report due in two hours. You
are almost done and all you would need is a quick look-through, but you
feel too tired to function anymore. So you head over to your office's
nap room for a power nap. You rest for a sweet 20-minute period then
head back to your desk, feeling refreshed. Sounds like a dream come true?

Surprisingly, such dreamy office practices are gradually turning into
reality, with multinational corporations such as Google, Facebook, Nike,
Uber, P&G, etc. setting up designated nap rooms and installing nap pods
along with promoting other de-stressing activities within their
campuses. And it is not just these industry giants that are adopting
this healthy practice. Many organizations, for instance start-ups
employing a huge number of *millennial* workforce, have started taking
initiatives towards promoting a culture of stress-free work environment.

Mumbai, Feb. 26 -- Today, accepting one's bodily attributes is the
premise on which the *millennial* mindset has based its grounds on. That
being said, there are some features that one would either like to
highlight or downplay. Seeking influence from the same train of thought,
fashion designer duo Shivan Bhatiya and Narresh Kukreja of Shivan &
Narresh, have designed numerous popular silhouettes for all body types -
maillots, bikinis and trikinis. "With swimwear, the idea of
inclusiveness in size and body confidence comes from shifting the focus
to strengths rather than hiding the weaknesses in a particular body
type. For example, for a bottom heavy, it's better to focus on the
beautiful collar bones by giving a one shoulder maillot. For a banana
shape, it's better to give a trikini so that a cut out at the waist
gives an illusion of an hourglass. The choice has always been open for
all body types, naturally making it a gratifying experience for the
customers," says Kukreja.

Recent years will show that the Philippine property market has become
one of the most valuable in all of Southeast Asia. In 2018, residential,
office, and commercial segments in the industry have withstood the
pressures of rising inflation, interest hikes, and a depreciating peso,
bolstered by ever-increasing demand from local and foreign investors.

By and large, many signs point to another positive year for Philippine
real estate. In a recent roundtable held by online real estate
marketplace Lamudi, property developers noted that continuous pace of
technological innovation is playing a bigger role in the development of
the industry going forward.

SK Telecom, one of the biggest South Korean telecommunications
operators, is establishing an e-sports company with Comcast, the
American telecommunications giant and the owner of global enterprises
such as NBC, Universal Studio, and DreamWorks Animation. The joint
venture project is expected to help SK Telecom to make inroads into the
ever-growing global e-sports market while boosting exposure to the
mainstream viewership represented by the *millennial* generation.

On Sunday, SK Telecom signed a strategic partnership with Spectacor,
Comcast's subsidiary in charge of the group's sports and entertainment
business, a day before the opening of Mobile World Congress 2019 in
Barcelona, Spain. Under the partnership, Comcast will become the second
largest shareholder of SK T1, an e-sports club founded in 2004 in which
SK Telecom holds the controlling stake.

Karen Alfonso’s two-year-old loves to play with a kitchen set and she
often helps the child peel onions. The Mumbai-based media professional
plans to get a doll for her toddler’s upcoming birthday. Malika Sadani’s
4-year-old is into dolls too. But her elder child, 7 years old, loves
soccer and has never played with Barbies, says the Gurgaon-based
cofounder of The Moms Co, a pre- and postnatal care products startup.
Gender stereotypes and years of conditioning would make most people
think that Alfonso has a baby girl and that Sadani’s elder one is a boy
and the younger one, a girl. In reality, Alfonso is planning to buy a
doll for her baby boy, while Sadani has two daughters with different
interests. Alfonso and Sadani are among the *millennial* mothers who
represent a small section of urban Indian parents adopting
gender-neutral ways to raise kids as individuals free from gender bias.
(Disclaimer: Alfonso works with the Times Group which publishes The ET
Magazine).

crore of turnover in last four years. What is happening in the Indian
consumer market? You have seen birth of Patanjali, growth of HUL, but
there's a big slowdown in other FMCG companies. What is the big trend
according to you?Rama Bijapurkar: The big trend is that consumption and
demand are absolutely fine. The problem is that supply has to catch up
with demand. Whoever is strategic and very good at execution and willing
to walk the long haul, is doing well. Consumption it is not like a tide
that sweeps in and out of companies.

The trio of three *millennial* stars Kartik Aaryan, Ananya Panday and
Bhumi Pednekar is all set to entertain and engage the audience with
'Pati, Patni Aur Woh’. This official remake of the 1978's drama, will be
hooking the audience next year in January on 10th. The movie will
feature Kartik Aaryan essaying the iconic role played by Sanjeev Kumar
in the original film.Recently, T-Series and BR Studios announced that
they will be producing a number of entertainers together, and 'Pati
Patni Aur Woh' stands as their first collaboration. Since the original
film was highly lauded by the audience, the expectation from the modern
redux is already high.Coming to behind the camera credits, the movie is
being directed by Mudassar Aziz, and produced by Bhushan Kumar, Juno
Chopra and Krishan Kumar. Reportedly, in order to keep the feel of the
film intact, irrespective of the modern strokes, the makers have kept
the nostalgic touch in the plot.

India, Feb. 26 -- The neologism - fourth Industrial Revolution or
Industry 4.0 - is not uncommon for policy makers and technocrats. Klaus
Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum,
published a book titled, The Fourth Industrial Revolution , and coined
the term at the Davos meeting in 2016. Since then, 'Industry 4.0' has
been a buzzword in all major economic and business summits. The world is
at the cusp of an unrivalled revolution. The first one captivated water
and steam to mechanise production; the second exploited electric power;
and the third relied on electronics and IT. The fourth is a
conglomeration of various automation technologies such as Artificial
Intelligence, Internet of Things, blockchain, fintech, autonomous
vehicles, 5G telephony, nanotechnology, biotech, machine learning,
robotics, quantum computing and the like.

Nicola McCloy drives the Forgotten World Highway from Stratford to
Taumarunui

I’m not going to lie, I was pretty bummed that we missed out on visiting
the Manutahi Museum, with its impressive collection of taxidermy.
Apparently it’s not only New Zealand’s largest collection of taxidermy,
but also one of the largest collections in the world — and all in the
Taranaki town of Lepperton. It’s only open on the weekends, and as we
were in town during the week we missed our chance (which suited Jane
perfectly as she’s an animal lover — and I don’t mean of the stuffed
variety).

Ever since its civil war ended in 1992, El Salvador has been governed by
two parties[https://www.apnews.com/31e7ca04e5e44ecd803aeadae7797412]:
the conservative National Republican Alliance and its former wartime
enemy, the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, a guerrilla
insurgency turned political party.

DAVID GREENE: The size of the average student loan has nearly doubled
over the past decade or so. Collectively, Americans carry more than $1.5
trillion in student loan debt, and some employers are seeing that as an
opportunity. They're offering to help repay loans on workers' behalf as
a way to attract and keep their talent. NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports.

YUKI NOGUCHI: Kelly O'Brien graduated from college six years ago with a
political science degree and $28,000 in student loans.

In the not-too-distant future, you could close on the sale of your home
in just a few days by using a smartphone app without ever even meeting
another human being.

A wave of new real estate technology backed by billions of investment
dollars is spreading across the U.S., threatening to disrupt a sedate
industry the way ride-sharing and online short-term rentals did to the
taxi and hotel businesses. New ways of processing data are speeding up
sales, better analyzing market rates and changing home financing.

Right after World War II, American Christianity, including Mormonism,
flourished. Religion was the rising tide that lifted everyone’s boat.

Now, with devotion to denominations declining, researcher and writer
Jana Riess set out to discover where Mormonism fits in the country’s
religious landscape.

As I slid the final pieces of furniture into the back of the ute, I
began to drive away from my old house to a new beginning. Then it dawned
on me, every *millennial*'s nightmare, I have no internet at my new place.

For 48 hours I was like Tom Hanks in the film Castaway. Walking around
the house, talking to inanimate objects, falling deeper into an
overly-dramatic boredom. After my two day online exile, I finally got on
to the internet company. The time on hold, like many would know, was
well over an hour.

Why more chief executives are stepping down than at any time since the
financial crisis

I recently came across some interesting statistics (see chart) showing
that more chief executives are stepping down from their posts than at
any time since the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Back then, bad
news was everywhere. Job cuts were massive. Markets were plunging. It
was easy to see why CEOs were leaving, or being pushed out, of their
jobs. So, why are corner offices being vacated en masse now?

Extended time off refreshes workers and allows companies to stress-test
their teams, writes Janina Conboye

I n the pursuit of a good work/life balance, employees are increasingly
opting for sabbaticals. They are taking unpaid leave — for weeks or even
months — to recharge batteries, pursue a project or even change careers.
And despite knowing that some staff will not return, a growing number of
companies now offer opportunities to take a break.

A BABY BOOMER'S GUIDE TO TRANSFORMATION

If you, like me, are a baby boomer, there must be days when you look
around the room and start to feel like you are surrounded by kids. There
are more of them, and less of us, with each passing month. And it is
only going to accelerate - it will never slow down - so if you are over
50 and are out there looking for a new job, be prepared. This is not
your father's job market. It isn't the job market you grew up in either.

Facebook said Monday that it would allow a network of
*millennial*-focused pages tied to the Russian state-backed media outlet
RT back on its platform after having previously suspended them following
inquiries by CNN.

Facebook suspended the
pages[https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/15/tech/russia-facebook-viral-videos/index.html],
run by a company called Maffick Media, on Friday, February 15th, as CNN
was preparing a report on Maffick's ties to RT, which is funded by the
Russian government. RT's subsidiary Ruptly is Maffick's majority
stakeholder.

to collect your boyfriend's share of the rent and allows your mom to
find out about it gives rise to all kinds of etiquette questions. Turns

better to answer them than Amy Dickinson? She writes the syndicated

THAT two months after the death of Martha Erika Alonso and Rafael Moreno
Valle, the state leader of the PAN, Genoveva Huerta, made a public
appearance to demand the result of the expert opinions and judicial
investigations, going on to highlight the trajectory of the deceased.
Unfortunately, Huerta appears to make a pronouncement without the
presence of the most important leaders of National Action, without
initiating the process for the appointment of pre-candidates, unlike
Morena, which shows the PAN as a party in frank decadence. THAT the
*millennial* of Milenio Puebla, Eduardo Moreno "Mored", presented in the
Reading Room of the FIL of Mining the book "My happy child", of the
publisher is AndaLee, of his authorship, written and illustrated by him.
He was accompanied in the presentation of the book by the writer
Christel Guczka (awarded as best writer in Canada) and the illustrator
and writer, Cintia Bolio.

Every year more millennials enter the workforce, which has the
opportunity to take advantage of the characteristics that distinguish
this generation. Beatriz Rivas, vice president of corporate affairs at
Great Place to Work, who locates herself in Generation X, defines
millennials based on their differences with age groups. "The way of
thinking and the mental processes of millennials allow them to connect
things that perhaps it was difficult for other generations to connect
with, this ability to connect different information points allows them
to go further, to apply technical knowledge," says Rivas. THE SUB-GROUPS
The expert points out that, within the same generation, there are
subgroups: the *millennial* senior, the *millennial* middle age and the
*millennial* junior. However, despite the distinctions of age and goals,
they share several characteristics.

India, Feb. 25 -- Once a lone wolf, Nokia has been trying hard to get
its moves right to capture the global mid-segment market. Since its
re-launch, the Nokia brand has seen an upward spiral in terms of growth.
Though it uses less powerful processors in its phones as compared to its
Chinese competitors, nations like India are still going for the Nokia
brand due to the proximity and the *millennial* population that is
always on the go. Keeping this in mind, Nokia has launched its two
mid-segment phones that are specifically aimed at content consumption.
Both the phones have a notification light indicator on the power button.

Nokia 3.2

*HD* 	Can Hamdard thrive in the era of the *millennial* consumer?

It is an ad that relies on contrasts: a product as traditionally
Pakistani as Hamdard's Rooh Afza being consumed by non-Pakistanis in New
York's Times Square, in front of a digital billboard on the NASDAQ
building displaying the product's branding. And as if to really drive
home the point that this is a company seeking a new image for an old
product, this Buzzfeed-style video of Americans trying a traditional
Pakistani drink for the first time was run as a digital ad on Facebook
video and YouTube.

The ad was meant to serve as the coming out party of Hamdard as a modern
brand and one of the first major moves by its new CEO, Usama Qureshi, a
39-year-old executive who was hired away from K-Electric and whose
experience prior to Hamdard was largely in the energy industry.

If it is true that the eyes are the windows to the soul, then eyewear
should be important, right? What we wear to help improve the way we see
the world and also protect our eyes is important. But is it form before
function or the other way around when it comes to eyewear?

Form and function, in this case, should go hand in hand. Luxury eyewear
has more features that make wear more comfortable and effortless. For
example, I have a pair of Burberry glasses with very flexible sides so
that they don't press into the sides of your head and give you a headache.

Some of our younger readers might be surprised to know that, in the old
days, users were literally required to cut and paste code to keep their
computers updated. And I do mean literally.

2019 FEB 25 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at
Global Warming Focus -- Investigators publish new report on Climate
Change. According to news reporting originating from Gif sur Yvette,
France, by VerticalNews correspondents, research stated, "Understanding
*millennial* and sub-*millennial* climate variability during past low
eccentricity interglacials similar to the Holocene is important for
forecasting the evolution of climate and natural variability. The Ideate
section (Montalbano Jonico, Southern Italy) studied here provides one of
the best records of MIS 19c, the closest orbital analog to the Holocene."

Appalachia wasn’t always conservative. In Virginia’s coal country, a
long history of grassroots organising is inspiring a new wave of
activism. By Elizabeth Catte

When my grandfather was a child, his stepfather would bring him along as
he sold moonshine to poor working men in south-west Virginia coal
country. The men adored my grandfather, who was not yet even school age,
for his talent for mocking Democrats. He told me this story on a few
occasions to explain, I think, the inevitability of his later
affiliation with the Republican party. He was a Republican in much the
same way that I am a Democrat – voting with little enthusiasm every few
years and sometimes not at all.

PARIS — Technology, the environment and social issues are among the key
preoccupations of the 20 semifinalists for the LVMH Prize for Young
Designers. They will be presenting their creations at a showroom during
Paris Fashion Week.

“More and more young designers are concerned about their environment,
both from an ecological and a social point of view,” said Delphine
Arnault, the force behind the initiative and a key talent scout at
family-controlled LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the parent of brands
including Louis Vuitton, Dior and Fendi.

US-based home rental startup Airbnb Inc. has launched ‘Plus Homes’ in
India, featuring the highest-rating homes, the company said in a statement.

“There’s a rising tide here in India,” said Nathan Blecharczyk,
co-founder and chief strategy officer at Airbnb. “Travel to emerging
economies is expected to increase at twice the rate of travel to
advanced economies from now until 2030, which is a truly promising
opportunity for Airbnb in India.”

Millennials are going crazy for the Green New Deal. Some say it’s more
popular than Instagram and more influential than the Top 40, but one
thing’s for sure; it has everybody talking. It’s just that those
conversations might not be what the Democratic Party was expecting.Maybe
telling people their truck has got to go, air travel should become a
thing of the past, nearly all the buildings in the United States need to
be remodeled, and cow flatulence is now punishable by the force of law
got people’s attention? President Donald Trump’s line “it sounds like a
high school term paper” was an accurate description of how many of us
view the green tropes of the new progressives.

MILAN — “Italy is having a moment,” according to Linda Fargo, senior
vice president, women’s fashion director and store presentation at
Bergdorf Goodman. “In many respects, this is Milan’s season. The
gravitational pull toward modern luxe and understatement is an Italian
sweet spot and we’re all in. Calming new neutrals were a big story here.
Brands like  Fendi, Max Mara, Loro Piana, Brunello Cucinelli, Agnona and
Valextra expressed it best. The pops of unexpected colors especially in
accessories but also in ready-to-wear were also a trend with pull
especially in tandem with the abundant neutrals.” Fargo also praised
Prada and Bottega Veneta’s reset by Daniel Lee — both named by several
retailers.

Trends were strong and included a Nineties vibe with grunge influences;
leather in all categories; revisited tailoring with a feminine
sensibility and boots galore.

BRIGHTON, England — Alex McIntyre was raised on budget cuts.

The youth center where he went after school was shuttered when he was
10. When he was 11, his mother’s housing benefit was shaved away, a
casualty of the Welfare Reform Act. By the time the streetlight in his
cul-de-sac began blinking off at midnight a few years later, these
events had knitted together into a single story, about a government
policy that had defined his childhood.

Impact investing is changing the world, offering socially conscious
investors opportunities to drive social and environmental change without
sacrificing financial returns. It’s become common in sectors like
renewable energy and education. But what about health care? It currently
ranks seventh among sectors receiving the most capital from impact
investors. That’s not high enough to kick-start momentum in the
advancement of precision medicines that will save millions of lives.

But it won’t take much to change that.

The South Florida office market is something of a nonconformist.

The real estate industry generally has been focused on urban cores
offering a live-work-play lifestyle — think downtown Miami, Fort
Lauderdale and West Palm Beach and Miami's Brickell and Wynwood
neighborhoods. But the office market increasingly has been checking out
the suburbs.

When a virtual assistant greets you when you call your bank or when a
chat box solicits your contact details on a travel website or the
information you search for on a real estate broker's listing page,
irrespective of time of day, you are experiencing chatbots at work.

If one parses the many definitions of chatbot over the Internet, they
all broadly agree that it is a computer programme or software that
engages with human users with pre-determined messages in a
conversational format.
