Fintech CBA has become the poster child for post-Hayne reconstruction,
committing to spend $1 billion a year on technology initiatives, writes
James Eyers.

The Commonwealth Bank has broken away from the pack. Its shares are
outperforming rivals, the bank has just announced an innovative new tech
strategy and for now at least, it is the poster child for post-Hayne
reconstruction.

An American *millennial* and travel blogger with a zest for expat
lifestyle inspires others to travel and live abroad. Nicole Brewer is an
author and freelance writer who has travelled to over 40 countries and
presently lives in Nizwa.

An ESL teacher in Oman, she earlier lived in South Africa, Germany and
South Korea and now takes advantage of living abroad by globe-trotting
the world. 'It is a life of freedom to do what I please, which is
travelling, while also immersing myself into different cultures. I
inspire others by sharing my experiences with people all over the world
on my blog and travel group,' she says. Having a passion for travel, she

Monday, February 3rd, just before 9 p.m., the airport Holiday Inn, Des
Moines, Iowa. A crowd of supporters and volunteers for Sen. Bernie
Sanders is buzzing. After four years of being shat upon by party
officials and media allies alike (CNN and MSNBC are seen in Sanders
crowds as Goebbels-ian arms of the Democratic National Committee),
Vermont’s anti-corporate crusader has defied odds and soared in polls.
All that remains is the schadenfreude orgasm of a victory speech.

A young animal-rights lawyer named Colin Grace is explaining how he got
turned on to Bernie. “Honestly, it started by looking into some of the
causes of 2008,” he laughs. “Well, then I found weed and became a
libertarian.”

You can try but you can't ignore LIZ JONES. Here she reflects on the
highs, lows - and 'I can't believe she said that!' moments - of being a
groundbreaking confessional columnist for 20 years PHOTOGRAPHS: MATTHEW
SHAVE

The first Monday back at work after the new millennium, 20 years ago, I
met my former boss for a drink. I regaled him with the story that, on
the most important date night of the century, I had been stood up. He
actually snorted vodka out of his nose. 'No!' 'Yes! I was the only human
on earth who spent Millennium Eve alone.' Despite the fact I had a fancy
new job as editor of Marie Claire, a wardrobe to match, a gorgeous
house, a company car and free beauty products and spa treatments on tap,
the man I had been on a couple of dates with and was madly in love with
failed to materialise. Rather than see me, he preferred to go down to
stand in the cold by the Thames to watch the fireworks with his mates.

Here are some calming hues that one can consider when it comes to
reducing stress and creating good vibes around the home. (Source:

Stress, anxiety and depression have lately become synonymous with
today’s fast and furious lifestyles, eventually taking a toll on
peoples’ wellbeing. While there are numerous remedies to this problem,
there is also an alternative psychological solution, which can bring
some respite to the magnifying population of stressed individuals –
colours. Evidently, both our mind and body react differently to seeing
colours, and using the right shades of paint in home backgrounds can be
a great way to keep stress levels under check.

Airlines are going through a tumultuous time. They hold passenger
records thanks to a cheap offer of flights that unite virtually every
place on the planet. But at the same time, there are bankruptcies like
those of Thomas Cook or Air Berlin that leave thousands of passengers
lying. Traditional companies are getting bigger and launching their own
low-cost brands to compete with *millennial* rivals like Ryanair or
easyJet. Cutting costs is the first priority, even at the expense of
passenger comfort. In that battle to reduce costs, alliances are no
longer sufficient and the industry faces an unprecedented consolidation
process from which Iberia's purchase of Air Europa is the latest episode.

Coronaviruses are an extensive group of common viruses that are part of
the Coronaviridae family, which can cause a variety of conditions, from
the common cold to more serious respiratory diseases, such as
bronchitis, pneumonia, MERS-CoV, SarS-CoV, among Other. To date there
are 39 species, and the most recent is the Wuhan coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

The virus has no nationality, and the simple rejection of what comes
from China is a mistake. If we compare what happened during the Spanish
conquest of America, Europeans would not be guilty of bringing the
diseases that almost wipeout the population. We were all human, until
race disconnected us, religion separated us, politics divided us, and
money classed us; This sums up the contempt and intolerance of China,
and exploits it on social media, with alarmist and unfounded claims.

The share of Americans in the labor force is the highest in nearly seven
years -- and the trend is led by younger women.

The overall U.S. labor-force participation rate climbed to 63.4% in
January, the biggest share since June 2013. Drilling into the latest
data released Friday, the gain reflects the highest participation in
almost two decades among prime-age women who are 25 to 54, called that
because the years are key for career-building.

Opening a bank account should not be stressful. In essence it is the
completion of a few forms, some proof of address, and identification. It
should not require your physical presence inside a branch.

And yet, much to my dismay as I found over the last few weeks, such
practices are still implemented by the banking industry's biggest
players. Having moved from Ireland and dealing with a barrage of forms
and documents, my patience had worn thin.

In New Hampshire, the Democratic field defines itself, unflatteringly,
as “cool newcomer” vs. “establishment experience.”

MANCHESTER, N.H. — For months, he played the big-talking front-runner,
swaggering if rarely steady, hoping voters would not linger long on the
tautology of his premise: Joe Biden was the candidate who should win, he
told fellow Democrats, because he was the candidate who could win.

No major American political party has nominated a full-throated
socialist for President. But after his strong showing in Iowa, could
Bernie Sanders be the first? That's the question Democrats have to ask
as Tuesday's New Hampshire primary approaches. Republicans may want to
hold the Schadenfreude.

The counting fiasco has muddled the Iowa results, but it seems Mr.
Sanders has either finished a narrow first or a close second to former
South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg. The Vermont Senator now leads in New
Hampshire by 4.7 points in the Real Clear Politics average. He has so
far held off Elizabeth Warren, his main challenger on the left, who
finished a distant third in Iowa and trails in the Granite State.

WASHINGTON— As home prices continue rising faster than wages in a
majority of U.S. markets, the National Association of Realtors® and its
1.4 million members have made housing affordability a top advocacy
priority in 2020. This topic was the focus of NAR’s second annual Policy
Forum, hosted today at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C.

“As America confronts low housing inventory and a persistent lack of
affordable housing options, NAR was grateful to bring together some of
the brightest minds in our industry at today’s Policy Forum,” said NAR
President Vince Malta, broker at Malta & Co., Inc., in San Francisco.
“With housing affordability set to be one of the defining policy issues
of this decade, it is imperative for NAR – along with economists,
lawmakers and other industry stakeholders – to lead discussions that
will generate solutions to these far-reaching problems.”

Backed by one of Canada's richest dynasties in 2015, Michael Katchen
once had high expectations for Wealthsimple, his upstart online
investment provider. Now, however, the company and its competitors face
a reckoning as they struggle to grow

M ichael Katchen hit $1-billion in assets, and the bombast started to flow.

In Iowa and New Hampshire, it's Mr. Buttigieg -- not Bernie Sanders --
who has complicated Ms. Warren's path, winning over college-educated
white voters using a similar message of Democratic unity.

MERRIMACK N.H. -- In the back row of an event geared toward veterans for
Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., on Thursday, a
discussion broke about one of his Democratic rivals -- Senator Elizabeth
Warren of Massachusetts.

The Telegraph'sHappiest Places to Work

Companies that want to attract the very best talent can no longer rely
on generous pay packets and pension contributions. Today's *millennial*
workforce wants more from an employer: free breakfasts, unlimited
holiday, flexible working and fun workspaces that provide a place in
which to wind down between meetings or during the lunch break.

From a study of the healing power of plants to reflections on grief,
relationships and alcoholism, a raft of new authors are using wildlife
as a starting point, says Hannah Stephenson

There's a crucial bond we've been severed from," says journalist and
nature writer Lucy Jones. As humanity has industrialised, commodified,
gentrified and all but destroyed the natural world, as we have shut
ourselves off from it in cars, offices and flats, we have simultaneously
found ourselves craving it.

It's billed as the first big set piece of the United States'
presidential election every four years. Since the mid-1970s, Iowa has
played an outsized role in the presidential candidate selection process.
After Democrats changed the rules to shift the power away from party
leadership, Iowa moved its caucus to become the first in the nation.

A relatively unknown former governor from Georgia, Jimmy Carter, spied
an opportunity. Though seen as a long-shot in a then crowded Democratic
field, Carter threw his efforts into Iowa, campaigning intensely in the
rural midwest state, where his folksy persona resonated with voters.
Carter ultimately became the party's nominee and president, correctly
guessing that the media exposure he would gain in Iowa could propel his
campaign.

Rahul Khanna, who describes himself as a "Boutique Bollywood Actor" on
Instagram, is routinely blesses his followers with snapshots of his
toned torso. On Thursday, he pulled out all stops.

While it's not known what warranted this, the actor's comments section
has been, in *millennial* lexicon, lit. "I feel there's a lesson here
about being in the right place at the right time," the actor noted
alongside the picture, in which he is seen standing in an open bathrobe
with a mirror protecting his modesty.

In the fashion world, there are a bunch of rules. Most people are scared
to break them, sometimes for good reasons, other times not.

About a year and a half ago, Kerby Jean-Raymond, the creative director
of the fashion line Pyer Moss, led subway-challenged fashion editors to
Crown Heights in Brooklyn for a show called “American, Also.” A fantasy
of black life free from the threat of racism and police brutality, it
featured a 40-person gospel choir, artwork by Derrick Adams and
references to “The Negro Motorist Green Book,” a pre-civil rights era
travel guide.

In recent years, art lovers have had occasion to both view and acquire
works by one of India’s earliest modernists, Prodosh Das Gupta — an
exhibition of whose works concluded recently at New Delhi’s Shridharani
Gallery. Born in 1912, Prodosh Das Gupta was also the first curator of
the National Gallery of Modern Art and was, no doubt, instrumental in
acquiring some of its stunning sculpture collection. Far less is made of
NGMA’s body of sculptures than its collection of paintings, though to be
fair its current director general has been bringing more focus to bear
on it than at any time previously.

As you read this in Mumbai or Bengaluru, most of us in the national
capital will be queueing up to cast our ballot in yet another election —
which is what you do when no inducement can persuade the bearer to pour
you a glass of frothy beer at the club. I guess prohibition does drive
more numbers to the polling stations, but let it be known that the
winning contender will have been picked amidst cheerless gloom when he
might have been voted in with a generous measure of G with T. So much
better if the Election Commission could find a way to send the
Electronic Voting Machines to vends where one might be enjoying a pint,
rather than having to make do with a cup of abominable tea or a glass of
unfermented juice at one’s own home. Elections are dreary enough
business without having the purgatory of detox imposed over it.

'I like gardening," the novelist Alice Sebold once said. "It's a place
where I find myself when I need to lose myself."

Nurturing mute, green things offered similar solace to Telegraph
journalist Alice Vincent after her heart was broken in 2017. Her
sprawling recovery-through-horticulture memoir has the potential to
become the *Millennial* generation's answer to self-help books like Eat
Pray Love. A kind of Peat Prune Gloves.

Go west to Washington state for a brand-new wine hotspot, writes Julie
Miller.

"I love my Swine!" a participant in my blending class gushes, cradling
her freshly-labelled bottle of red. Blushing with embarrassment, she
adds, "Sorry, inner dialogue - I didn't mean to say that out loud. But I
do love my wine, it's so delicious!"

What drove the Commonwealth Bank to go into business with European
fintech firm Klarna? Clancy Yeates reports.

As the Commonwealth Bank was plotting its attack on Afterpay's turf, a
major changing of the guard in how Australians pay for goods and
services was well underway.

There is no better way to lift the spirits, to soothe a troubled soul or
a broken mind. But is that always true?

In the modern age, art is held to account as rarely before. Our museums,
galleries, concert halls must point to visitor numbers, popular acclaim
and financial robustness to help justify their continued existence.
Together, they assemble figures to show their true worth to their
nations’ economies. In the case of the UK, culture and arts-related
activities amounted to more than £10bn in 2019. Let us flourish, cry the
institutions. We pay our way.

The relationship between London and regional house prices appears to
have changed — and the outlook is uncertain

The wrong side of the property cycle can be an uncomfortable place to be.

Bold, brave and Insta-hip, the young painter has hit the big time by
creating digitally-assisted work

Very few artists are as hot as Avery Singer right now. The New
York-based *millennial*, born in 1987, has already had solo exhibitions
in the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles, Vienna’s Secession and, most
recently, the Museum Ludwig in Cologne. Last year, she was chosen by
Ralph Rugoff to show in his prestigious May You Live in Interesting
Times exhibition at the Venice Biennale. Buyers of Singer’s work range
from private collectors such as Christian Boros and Anita Zabludowicz to
institutions including New York’s Museum of Modern Art. In May 2018, a
2013 Singer work that was offered at Sotheby’s with an estimate of
$80,000 to $120,000 sold for an impressive $600,000 ($735,000 with fees).

VANCOUVER—Last week, in defiance of all rules of civility, I called
Myriam Larouche at 5:45 a.m.

It was gracious enough that she answered at that hour. Then, she
proceeded to tell me cheerfully about her life. She told me of her study
and travels during two planned years abroad, of her family back in
Quebec, and of the city that had just begun to feel like home until it
devolved into a near ghost town as it reckoned with a deadly virus outbreak.

Hotels and restaurants are reshaping the look, feel and appeal of their
properties, using exterior and interior designs as one of the
differentiating methods to create unique experiences. Hospitality spaces
are moving from utilitarian functionality to contemporary aesthetics and
experience driven developments engaging the senses. By Akshay Nayak

Historically, the development of lodging areas and facilities has mostly
been driven by their physical locations, such as at major
business/trading hubs, travel ports and tourist centres (railway
stations, etc), or in locations lending themselves to defense, such as
forts or castles. Today, while property location continues to be a key
consideration, hotel design has moved from utilitarian functionality to
contemporary aesthetics and experience driven developments engaging the
senses.

It is time that concepts like Artificial Intelligence and machine
learning also enter the field of marketing and pricing, and not just
directly relating to enhancing superior guest experience, says Siddharth
Goenka, founder, Aiosell Technologies

Hotel bookings around the world have changed much faster than what the
industry had anticipated. Players in the sector have recently witnessed
a lot of automation and innovation around guest experience and augmented
reality.

In a world where emerging business owners favour the mentorship of
celebrated moguls like Dangote and Mo Abudu, Taiwo Adeyemi prefers to
pattern himself after self-made mover, shaker and consummate
deal-closer, Clarence Avant, 'the Black Godfather'.

This is not surprising in the least with the kind of ecclectic empire
his talent agency, Boxx Culture is positioned to build.

The Commonwealth Bank has broken away from the pack. Its shares are
outperforming rivals, the bank has just announced an innovative new tech
strategy and for now at least, it is the the poster child for post-Hayne
reconstruction.

What a change from 2 1/2 years ago, when CBA was left reeling by the
AUSTRAC money laundering case. It remained on the back foot as a
prudential inquiry into its governance lambasted the bank's risk
culture, and the Hayne royal commission found it, like other banks, had
ridden roughshod over customers.

Afterpay has told the Reserve Bank of Australia it "should not be
considered a payment system", and its merchant fees need to be
benchmarked against the much higher costs that Facebook, Google and
Amazon charge for business referrals.

As the Reserve Bank considers whether to stop buy now, pay later
providers preventing merchants from passing costs on to customers, part
of a broad review of the payments system, Afterpay has implored the
central bank to avoid imposing regulation that would "stifle innovation,
compromise consumer choice and reduce competition".

Three years ago, Ada Calhoun couldn't sleep. The 41-year-old writer
stared at her ceiling wondering why her hard-won accomplishments had
left her feeling exhausted, anxious and wanting. She had written two
well-regarded books and a long list of magazine articles. She was
married and her son had just been accepted to a great public middle
school. From the outside, she knew, her life looked good.

Yet she was kept awake by freelancing assignments that had fallen
through, corporate job opportunities that had evaporated and her
family's looming credit card debt. When she looked in the mirror and saw
wrinkles and a wider midsection, she asked herself "whose body is this?"
After decades of doing everything right, growing up at a time when women
were told they could do everything, this was not how life was supposed
to go.

Today, Bernie Sanders called a press conference in New Hampshire to
declare himself the winner of the Iowa caucus. Which would be fine—after
all, he won the popular vote in the caucus—if not for one complicating
factor: Pete Buttigieg had already declared victory in the Iowa caucus,
because he is leading in the estimate of delegates won.

In the 2010s, the national unemployment rate dropped from a high of 9.9
percent[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE] to its current rate
of just 3.5 percent. The economy expanded each and every year. Wages
picked up for high-income workers as soon as the Great Recession
ended[https://www.epi.org/publication/ib347-earnings-top-one-percent-rebound-strongly/],
and picked up for lower-income workers in the second
half[https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/03/wages-rising/519114/?utm_source=feed]
of the decade. Americans’ confidence in the
economy[https://news.gallup.com/poll/283940/economic-confidence-highest-point-2000.aspx]
hit its highest point since 2000, right before the dot-com bubble burst.
The headline economic numbers looked good, if not great.

Cool offices may boost productivity and be an effective tool for
recruiting staff

Companies that want to attract the very best talent can no longer rely
on generous pay packets and pension contributions. Today’s *millennial*
workforce want more from their employer: free breakfasts, unlimited
holiday, flexible working and fun work spaces that provide them with a
place to wind down in between meetings or during their lunch break.

Since time immemorial, India has been one of the most aspirational
markets for international traders seeking exotic and unique products
from India, which could be exchanged for goods from their land. We are
all aware of the historic silk route and the era of behemoths like
Britain, Spain, Portugal and other European powerhouses who ventured
inland to India and were vying for the trading share of this exotic and
prosperous country. After India’s colonization, all the trading with
different countries seized to exist and it did not improve much till
India’s historic globalization policies in 1991 which led to foreign
brands and companies to come and do business in India again. This
further improved in 2004 when the Indian government brought in various
policies that helped foreign businesses to trade and even invest in our
country.

New Delhi, Feb. 7 -- Call it the horologist's nightmare, but convenience
has trumped posh. Millennials are strapping on Apple Watches rather than
storied Swiss-made timepieces-the benchmark for luxury-in keeping with
these multi-tasking times.

Shipments of Apple Watch, launched in 2015 as a "groundbreaking health
and fitness companion", have crossed those of Swiss watches. Apple
shipped 30.7 million units of its ubiquitous watches worldwide in 2019
against the 21 million units moved by the entire Swiss watch industry,
market researcher Strategy Analytics reported on Wednesday.

A good way to feel old is to have a major food company reintroduce a
“nostalgia” product like Dunkaroos that you didn’t know about when it
was a hit.

This snack produced by General Mills was popular in the 1990s, so they
must have been selling them in my neighborhood grocery.

SEATTLE, WA / ACCESSWIRE / February 7, 2020 / Ethereum came into the
picture in 2015, but it gained little recognition due to the Bitcoin
boom. Bitcoin had taken control of the digital world, and everyone
craved to have a share in it.

To much amusement, almost half of the buyers had no idea about Bitcoin
or blockchain in particular was. The blockchain revolution found itself
suppressed under the Bitcoin buying spree. Blockchain was a solution to
a lot of existing problems for people across the globe. Its use and
practical implementation were limitless.

A larger percentage of newly originated mortgages to millennials shifted
toward purchase loans as interest rates stayed low, according to Ellie
Mae[https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/list/5-pros-and-cons-of-ellie-mae-going-private].

The purchase share continued increasing in December off the momentum of
the preceding months, climbing to 72% from 68% the month
earlier.[https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/millennials-take-advantage-of-low-mortgage-rates]
However, it's still way behind the 88% share from December

After closing the gap through the summer and fall, the refinance share

Not sure how to pronounce the *millennial* candidate's last name? Fear
not! We've got you covered.

There are a number of challenges Pete Buttigieg may face during his bid
for the White House, from convincing voters to elect the nation’s first
openly gay president, to reminding folks that 38-years-old is, in fact,
old enough to serve as the commander-in-chief.

Housing supply in the U.S. continued to fall in the first month of 2020,
leading to higher prices and faster sales in almost all the major
markets, according to a report by realtor.com[http://realtor.com]
released Friday.

Compared to January 2019, national housing inventory declined 13.6%-the
largest fall in more than four years-to the lowest level since

About 10% of Australians already use instalment payments, but as a new
player enters the market, finance experts warn that the industry is
under-regulated

When Matt Jackson, 30, started eyeing off a $600 denim jacket online, it
was Afterpay that convinced him to make the purchase. “There’s just no
way I would have bought that outright,” he admits. “But spreading it out
somehow made it feel like it wasn’t as expensive.”

GOP believes it has an answer to the Green New Deal, as do some
Democrats — both keep fossil fuels in the mix

More young Republicans are demanding that climate-change deniers pipe
down and legislators take up the fight against accelerating global
warming, plastics pollution and more.

2020 FEB 14 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at
Chemicals & Chemistry -- Data detailed on Science - Paleoceanography and
Paleoclimatology have been presented. According to news originating from
Sydney, Australia, by VerticalNews correspondents, research stated, "One
of the major phases of sea level rise during the last deglaciation
(similar to 19-11 thousand years before present [ka BP]) is Meltwater
Pulse-1A (MWP-1A; similar to 14.5 ka BP), when sea levels rose by 8.6 to
18 m in less than 400 years. Whether the meltwater originated from the
partial disintegration of northern hemispheric ice sheets, from
Antarctica, or both, remains controversial."

Financial support for this research came from Centre of Excellence for
Environmental Decisions, Australian Research Council.

Letter -- A new study on Science is now available. According to news
reporting from Corvallis, Oregon, by NewsRx journalists, research
stated, "Sea-level histories during the two most recent
deglacial-interglacial intervals show substantial differences despite
both periods undergoing similar changes in global mean temperature and
forcing from greenhouse gases. Although the last interglaciation (LIG)
experienced stronger boreal summer insolation forcing than the present
interglaciation, understanding why LIG global mean sea level may have
been six to nine metres higher than today has proven particularly
challenging."

reporting from Salzburg, Austria, by NewsRx journalists, research
stated, "The evolution of the drainage system in the Eastern Alps is
inherently linked to different tectonic stages of the alpine orogeny.
Crustal-scale faults imposed eastward-directed orogen-parallel flow on
major rivers, whereas late orogenic surface uplift increased topographic
gradients between the foreland and range and hence the vulnerability of
such rivers to be captured."

2020 FEB 15 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at
Journal of Transportation -- New research on the travel sector has found
that 56% of UK airline passengers report that they spend more time than
they want to using digital channels to plan and book flights. Similarly,
47% of UK hotel guests report that they spend too much time planning and
booking a hotel stay. Of the UK travellers surveyed, 70% reported that
they would like to receive personalized offers from travel sellers and
75% report they are comfortable sharing personal data if it will help
them save money or have better journeys. However, despite this, just 18%
say they receive offers that reflect their interests, travel behaviours
or stage in their lives. This is despite the travel sector being one of
the pioneering e-commerce sectors and one of the largest digital
commerce sectors globally.

study by digital agency Compose[d]
suggests.[https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.mediapost.com/uploads/Composed_Unlocking_Brand_Loyalty_Report.pdf]


The agency surveyed 500 U.S. adults to gauge their opinions about brand
loyalty and preferences among product categories such as clothing,
shoes, accessories, fragrances, hair products, beauty and skincare. The
survey also asked about social media platforms as a tool for product
discovery.

Her daughter was a bridesmaid at William and Kate’s wedding, she’s
married to their friend Hugh van Cutsem and she’s a step-cousin to
Samantha Cameron. Oh, and she chose the members for Soho Farmhouse.
Andrew Billen meets her

Rose Astor is an impressive journalist and entrepreneur. The problem
(for her) is that her achievements can be obscured by the twin clouds of
ancestry that trail not just after, but around and about her. So while I
really want to know about the yummy-mummy members’ clubs she co-founded,
her retreat from a too-busy life in London to a simpler one in the
Cotswolds, her decision to give up booze and her latest job teaching
yoga with a “girl who works at my local pub”, I fear I am also curious
about the Astors and, more embarrassingly for her, her husband’s clan’s
close friendship with the monarchy.

Mayor de Blasio's new affordable housing plan takes a page out of the
*millennial*-living handbook by updating zoning laws to allow so-called
"tiny houses" to be built in city backyards.

"By creatively unlocking what's already in our backyards, we can make
more affordable homes available for renters and give new lifelines to
struggling homeowners," said Matthew Creegan, a spokesman for the city
Department of Housing Preservation and Development.

Living in a world that corners women into the kitchen and carrying the
label to bear children is a curse and it is about time we change that
narrative. I once read a book where the main character, a female, wanted
to go to school but society and tradition told her otherwise. Her father
rhetorically asked her whether one can cook and feed books to her
husband - clearly reminding her of the place society determines she belongs.

This is the exact grand narrative we need to dismantle when it comes to
the girl child. This story was in a Nigerian setting, yet it reminded me
of the spectrum I grew up in - a space where women were not even given
the benefit of the doubt to dream and become who they want to be. It
reminded me of how easily women and their dreams are shot down by
society because being successful and a breadwinner is regarded as the
job of the male character.

Did reaction to Matthew Lopez’s award-winning play about gay history
vary by generation? We put that question to readers of our theater
newsletter.

Ben Brantley’s review of “The
Inheritance”[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/17/theater/the-inheritance-review-broadway-matthew-lopez.html?searchResultPosition=1#commentsContainer]
drew more than 100 comments, signaling the strong reactions engendered
by the show. (One reader called the play “pompous, elitist, superficial”
and “magnetically entertaining” all at once.) Did the show’s impact vary
by generation? We put that question to readers of our theater
newsletter. An edited selection of their responses follows. (You can
