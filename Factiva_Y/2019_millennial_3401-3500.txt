Because it is the 15th birthday of Facebook, and because that span seems
both an extremely short and an extremely long amount of time for
Facebook to have existed, I recently rewatched The Social Network, David
Fincher’s 2010 film about the founding of the website that would reshape
the world.

Special to the Star Tribune At the end of the meal, the question was
always the same: “Did you save room for banana pudding?” Our answer was
always the same, too. A resounding “no!” That’s because we were full as
ticks, as they say in the South, after sampling plate after plate of
North Carolina’s legendary barbecue. My 31-year-old son and I spent a
muggy, buggy summer week driving the Tar Heel State’s highways and back
roads to search out its most flavorful pork. Tucking in our napkins at
seven spots in six days, we experienced a slice of Americana as thick as
the smoke that infused the meat before us, rubbing shoulders with
generations of barbecue royalty in the process. A hungry visitor to
North Carolina is never more than a stone’s throw from a joint that
invariably has a sign with a pig on it.

"In Shanghai all those years ago, my father owned a clothing factory and
workshop, which the government eventually took over," Lisa Xia says.
"When I was little, he would make me beautiful clothes all year around -
these great coats in the winter and gorgeous silk long dresses and
skirts for the summers."

An avid buyer of European couture and ready-to-wear, the stylish Xia, a
socialite once voted one of Asia's best dressed women, is a regular in
China's society columns, decked out in the latest styles and jewellery.
Her daughter, 21-year-old Parsons School of Design student Natasha Lau,
who was born in Hong Kong, acquired her mother's taste for luxury
fashion early. The pair often sit front row at Dior shows and attend
China's most important fashion events.

These are heady days for Democrats. Speaker Nancy Pelosi is flexing her
power in the House, state legislatures are sweeping away abortion
boundaries and each day brings a new entry into the 2020 presidential
sweepstakes.

Far-left newcomers demand massive tax hikes on the wealthy, free health
care for all and an end to fossil fuels. Some are even attacking
America's Judeo-Christian heritage.

Indians have a third option, leisure, and they consider it an essential
component of the healthy lifestyle, and the traditional status-quo of
the Indian household has been disrupted

The social fabric of India is at the centre of a transition where people
are recalibrating their approach towards their time and investments. Due
to three dominant trends - a proclivity towards nuclear families,
purchasing power of the millennials, and the high penetration levels of
the internet, Indians today are taking a breather to focus and spend on
their own leisure.

New Delhi, Feb. 3 -- A five-year-old I know told me recently that his
plan is to become a cat doctor. A cat doctor but not a fat doctor, he
elaborated. "I want to be smooth," he said. He also mentioned that he
would wear a cat mask so as to not frighten his patients. I didn't
argue. It's hard enough to meet young people who are optimistic about
the future.

I spent my teens in Bengaluru and didn't question when my small city
became a big city just as I became an adult. I didn't doubt that I would
still find a job somewhere even though the dotcom bubble burst just as I
graduated. Or that anyone would hire someone who had a journalism
degree. I went about these things with as much deep thinking as the
future cat doctor. I am pretty sure I had no ambitions to smoothness but
certainly I didn't feel like the world was rough towards me. I was among
the lucky and privileged, I was told, and I believed it.

Cary is a struggling actor auditioning for "man at party who smells
fart" in a commercial. His sister, Brooke, danced as a kid but is now
jobless and homeless. So life kind of sucks for these *millennial*
siblings. Then something happens that makes it suck even more: Their
13-year-old brother Chase becomes a megastar after posting a song called
"I Wanna Marry U at Recess" on YouTube. Show-biz pundits predict he'll
be "the next big white kid."

That's the premise for "The Other Two" (10:30 p.m. Thursdays on Comedy
Central), a dark and existential sitcom that probes tough questions
like, "What if I'm just not good enough?" and yet keeps the laughs coming.

Already the most significant long-term trend affecting drinks companies,
climate change will top the 2019 agenda with an acceleration in
greenhouse gas(GHG) emission reductions urgently needed. Agricultural
supply chains will be a prime focus as companies come under pressure to
reduce their indirect 'Scope 3' emissions. Ben Cooper investigates.

A report from the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) in October, warning just how off the pace global efforts
to address climate change are, briefly brought the world to rapt - and
justly-alarmed - attention.As the narrower fixations of the age
reclaimed their contrastingly-undeserved monopolisation of the news
agenda, there could be a feeling that it was just another exposition of
the risks of climate change. All it has to say to the global community,
and to its drinks manufacturers, is that an issue that was already
incontestably the gravest threat humankind isfacing, remains so.

? Former Starbucks CEO, Howard Schultz, is preparing to run for
president of the United States, through an independent candidacy. Foto
Ap L The exploration of an independent presidential candidacy of
billionaire Howard Schultz, 65 years old and former boss of Starbucks
for 23 years, caused concern in the Democratic Party because it would
benefit the hypothetical re-election of Donald Trump.

The candidacy of Schultz's capuccino has been worth a couple of strong
criticisms in just two days of the NYT, spokesperson for the Soros /
Obama / Clinton axis: 1. Jamelle Bouie ruled that Schultz does not
understand US history, since the most effective candidates for a third
party they have been polarizing and not centrist;
(https://nyti.ms/2TroXVG[https://nyti.ms/2TroXVG]) and 2. Bret Stephens
judges that Schultz equals the Imbalance Syndrome when the war of the
left against the centrists does not bode well for the Democratic Party's
chances in 2020 (https: // nyti.ms/2BhIYqN).

monitor the time they spend on the app. This comes in the wake of
several NPOs reporting that the picture-sharing social media platform
has scored the least among its competitors in terms of user's mental
health. “Seeing friends constantly on holiday or enjoying nights out can
make young people feel like they are missing out while others enjoy
life,” stated the #StatusOfMind report (based on surveys in the UK).
“These feelings can promote a ‘compare and despair' attitude,” the
report goes on to say.

As of October, 2018 over 71 million users on Instagram came from India,
second only to the United States, where over 121 million users upload
and share content of their ‘instagram-worthy' lives on a daily basis.

TOURISM is the one sector that experiences changing trends and
expectations and that is what makes the industry so exciting. Keeping up
with the trends is vital if we want to attract more international visitors.

Right now, it is the *millennial* generation which has the power and is
influencing what tourism will look like in future. This market is the
new gold, with millennials spending about $200 billion (R2.73 trillion)
on travel annually, according to Forbes magazine. That figure is
expected to increase significantly in the coming years.

Does Grand Designs numb the pain as the housing crisis continues?

Micro-homes” ran a recent BBC
headline[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-46938445], “could
solve London’s housing crisis.” A neoliberal thinktank, it went on, is
calling for the Greater London Authority to scrap its rules on minimum
floor space, saying homes in the capital with less than 37sq m of floor
space could be an “affordable opportunity” for young people. I
calculated that figure – the size of approximately 30 bath towels,
overlapping slightly – while reading the story on my phone while
drinking tea while watching Grand
Designs[https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/sep/19/grand-designs-tiny-folly-review]

Is there a middle ground between Narendra Modi and his political rivals?
Is it possible to admit to having voted for the Bharatiya Janata Party
in 2014 without being vilified, or to express qualified support for the
Congress and not be labeled anti-national? As the discourse in India
grows more polarised and another General Election inches nearer,
millennials are increasingly asking these questions.

Some, like Kazim Rizvi, 30, a public policy entrepreneur from Lucknow,
confront this dilemma with a pop culture reference. There is a scene in
the Batman movie, The Dark Knight, in which the villain, the Joker,
pours water on the idea that a big fight will solve everything about
their city, Gotham. “You didn’t think I would risk losing the battle for
Gotham’s soul in a fist fight with you?” the villain says in his final
stand-off. Rizvi echoes this sentiment.

CLOTHING retailer Zara has found itself at the centre of a furore — not
regarding its questionable manufacturing practices, its unsustainable
business model or its poor record on accessibility for disabled
patrons... but for its new logo.

There are few things that stoke the fires of *millennial* discontent
quite like controversial typeface decisions. The all-caps new logo kind
of looks like the old logo pressed together from both ends. Letters
overlap. Your throat constricts just looking at it. It makes people feel
claustrophobic, anxious: what could be more perfect for Zara, proud home
of the high street's most savage queues and tachycardiac sale racks? The
previous iteration of the logo was stretched out — an embarrassment of
luxurious white space between words. It felt laidback, calm, expansive:
the precise opposite of Zara's brutal returns policy.

More A-road than A-list, Soho House's latest venture is a chic yet
affordable motel. Susan d'Arcy makes the first pit stop

Until last week, "Swindon" would probably have drawn a blank stare from
a typical Soho House member. On Wednesday, however, all that changed,
when the private club-cum-hotel franchise opened its latest venture near
the Wiltshire town, whose previous claim to fame was being named the
UK's most average place to live (2007).

Face to Face by Professor Jim McCaul Penguin £9.99 McCaul's "true
stories of life, death and transformation" from his career as a facial
surgeon are fascinating. Powerful accounts of individual patients are
interwoven with glimpses of his childhood and youth: the mother with
post-polio pain who inspired him to become a surgeon; the gruelling
training; his time in Glasgow, where many patients were victims of
drunken fights, and in Miami, where they treated at least one gunshot
victim a day. Writing this book, he says, "has been one of the hardest
things" he has done, because he had to lower the "professional shield"
that enables him to do his job. He needn't have worried. It is a
brilliant introduction to one of the most exacting areas of medicine and
a glimpse of humans at their best.

A sleek new ship for the young (and young at heart) is quietly making
waves along the blue Danube with a hip schedule including street food
tours and a silent disco, says Dara Flynn

The first thing to remember about river cruising is to forget everything
you've learnt about ocean cruising. Once you've done that, delete any
notions, too, about the floating mini-palaces on Europe's biggest
rivers, populated by a generation or two above you.

THE CRITICS

Pure C4, Wed Catastrophe C4, Tue Broad City Comedy Central, Fri Shooting
the Darkness RTE1, Wed Clouded thinking is the trademark of Pure, a
story about the destructiveness of dark thoughts recounted in a manner
that highlights the tyranny of bad ideas. The heavily hyped six-part
comedy drama, hailed by advance publicity as "unashamedly confessional"
and "inventively graphic", purports to offer a candid account of life
with obsessive-compulsive disorder. In reality, it's far from compulsive
viewing.

OUR CHOICE In Byron’s Wake: The Turbulent Lives of Lord Byron’s Wife and
Daughter, Annabella Milbanke & Ada Lovelace by Miranda Seymour Simon &
Schuster £12.99 As Seymour relates the events of the brief, disastrous
marriage of Lord Byron and Annabella Milbanke, you gasp at each fresh
cruelty. Byron’s foul moods and rages alarmed his bride. Worse, his
married half-sister, Augusta, with whom he was amorously entangled, came
to live with them. In 1815, things fell apart. Annabella gave birth to a
daughter, Ada, and took the baby off to her parents. Byron fled to the
Continent, and Annabella devoted herself to philanthropy. Yet it is Ada,
who has garnered the limelight. In 1842, she translated an essay on
Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine. The seven footnotes she added are
startling. She showed how a string of instructions from punched cards
could guide the machine to calculate a complex sequence of numbers. Ada
also fancied she could become a great opera singer,

life,” stated the #StatusOfMind report (based on surveys in the UK).
“These feelings can promote a ‘compare and despair' attitude,” the
report goes on to say.

As of October, 2018 over 71 million users on Instagram came from India,
second only to the United States, where over 121 million users upload
and share content of their ‘instagram-worthy' lives on a daily basis.

On January 24, the symbolic Doomsday Clock stood at two minutes to
midnight, the closest it has got since it was configured by the Bulletin
of the Atomic Scientists in 1947. N-arms, climate change and the
increased use of information warfare are key threats.

A generational change is coming but older candidates can no longer be
dismissed

Fifty-eight years after President John F. Kennedy proclaimed “the torch
has been passed to a new generation," many Democrats long for another
young dynamo, one who can harness the energy of millennials to oust
President Trump.

We all do it — plant them in the wrong spot and rue the mistake for
years — but with some pruning even small gardens can accommodate trees

N obody wants to plant the wrong tree in the wrong place, but almost all
of us do so. Over the years I have earned form in this subsection of
gardening, so I want to pass on hard-won knowledge, warnings and some
top tips. The English winter has been amazingly favourable for gardening
and planting. If February continues in the same mood, it will be a
brilliant time for planting well-grown bare-rooted trees.

E very *millennial* I have ever met — and I have two of my own — treats
their bed as a desk. Surveys confirm that the sack is the new office.
And why not? Doesn't everyone like to prop themselves up against the
pillows and bash out the odd document to beat a deadline? If labouring
between the sheets has as much appeal as a long overdue visit to the
hygienist, then you don't know what you are missing.

Admittedly, there are those like me who are addicted, and those who
treat working from bed as a last resort, as in "I can't get anything
done anywhere else". The bedroom certainly offers peace and solitude,
which is hard to find in an open-plan hot-desking office or a co-working
space.

A good article on a difficult topic ("Inside Prevent, the UK's
controversial counter-terrorism programme", Jan 26/27).

I sympathise with Prevent, it is nigh on impossible to demonstrate
direct success in a negative outcome. Given the relatively minimal costs
and largely voluntary nature of the activities, I consider it time and
effort well spent. Hopefortomorrow via FT.com @Will_Tanner January 26
Deradicalisation is messy, complex and often imperfect. But, as this
brilliant and balanced @FT long read on the government's Prevent
strategy shows, it is also essential Re Robert Shrimsley's column
"Mobile phones are life-enhancing" (Jan 26/27). I was born before colour
TV. For me, every day with a smartphone is magical. I assure all you
young hand-wringers: life was not better without it.

Forty-nine years ago, thousands of brave Filipino youth fought the
dictatorial regime of the late Ferdinand Marcos with a series of mass
demonstrations.

The strings of protest that evolved in the early part of 1970 launched
the very popular movement among the young generation of that time - the
First Quarter Storm or FQS.

The Brooklyn-based gonzo news outfit said it will slash 10 percent of
its workforce, or about 250 jobs - the latest in a wave of layoffs that

Has the *millennial* generation really been "screwed"? Take a quick
survey of friends and you'll get answers from "yes," to "no," to eye
rolls and groans at the mere mention of "millennials," likely divided
along lines of age.

Even the millennials themselves aren't completely sold on the
oft-floated notion that life is harder for them than it has been for
previous generations.

'The damning truth is austerity is making our society sicker, it means

Scarlet fever, whooping cough and a host of diseases more familiar to
the characters of a Dickens novel than your average *millennial* have
surged more than 52 per cent under Tory governments since 2010.

Every day there are more national figures that are placed in the taste
of fashionistas from all over the world, as they print their personal
touch on the main red carpets and put on high the name of Mexico on a
global level. Thanks to their talent and style, these ladies have
reserved seats in the best parades, are photographed by specialized
publications, succeed in the networks with their photographs and blogs,
and are examples to follow for many young people. Here we present a list
of six of them, determined by a jury made up of image expert Araceli
Motta and designers Benito Santos and David Salomón. Know them! ADRIANA
ABASCAL This socialite, presenter and blogger based in France - and who
in 1989 represented the Country in Miss Universe - has always projected
great style and presence. Due to its slender figure, it looks charming
and radiates sophistication with the proposals of renowned creatives. In
short, of the most elegant Mexican women of the moment.

NEW YORK -- At lunchtime on a recent afternoon, the chain steakhouse Del

shouting at one another over the blare of Fleetwood Mac.

For Sarah Schneider and Chris Kelly, the generic environment triggers

For one of the fastest-growing sectors of the global travel industry,
there is no pork on the hotel dinner menus. There are flights with no
alcohol on the drink carts, resorts with separate swimming pools for men
and women, and daily itineraries with built-in break times for the five
daily calls to prayer.

Since 2016, the number of Muslim travellers has grown nearly 30 per
cent, and a recent joint study by Mastercard and Crescent Rating, a
research group that tracks halal-friendly travel, projects that over the
next decade that sector's contribution to the global economy will jump
to $300 billion (U.S.) from $180 billion. With a population that is
disproportionately young, educated and upwardly mobile, they are one of
the fastest-growing demographics on the global tourism scene.

The once stuffy genre has been given a reboot, with emotional truth as
important as historical fidelityModern Toss on period dramas

As Oscar season hots up, the frontrunner in several categories is The
Favourite[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/30/the-favourite-review-olivia-colman-yorgos-lanthimos],
Yorgos Lanthimos’s marvellously mad film about jostling for power in
Queen Anne’s court. The film’s success represents Olivia Colman’s
[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/18/the-favourite-olivia-colman-rachel-weisz-emma-stone]
elevation to the highest echelons of the movie hierarchy, but if it wins
big on 24 February it will also mean a return to favour for a genre
largely ignored by the Academy in recent years: the period drama.

in for particular
disdain[https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/your-favorite-selfie-filter-could-be-contributing-mental-health-crisis-ncna837376]

Mistakes Millennials Make in 401(K) Rollovers

(PRWeb) - A 401(K) rollover can be tricky. Even American IRA, a
Self-Directed IRA administration firm, understands that millennials
sometimes make mistakes when rolling over their 401(K) to a more
advantageous retirement account. Thats why the company recently released
a list of the mistakes that millennials make when undertaking this type
of rollover, as well as advice for ensuring that those mistakes do not
happen.

In one scenario, the article points out the example of a 22-year old
worker earning $40,000 per year and saving 6% of their paycheck in a
401(K), with the employer matching another 3%. Assuming a 6% rate of
return, that person can accumulate $827,000 by retirement at age 67.
However, if the same worker were to wait until 30 to start saving, the
same flat annual contribution of $3,600 will only be $490,000a full
third of a million dollars less than the original estimation.

When Peninsula Insurance closed two large office buildings in Downtown
Salisbury last summer and cut or transferred more than 40 employees, it
was a gut punch to city redevelopment efforts.

After all, these two buildings had held insurance offices dating back
decades and were once owned by the legendary Sam Seidel.

The hit series is back -in all its deliciously risqué, raucous
glory-gathering hordes of devoted Fleabaggers in its wake.Its creator
and star, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, tells Gavanndra Hodge about h
0219-A014ut her irresistible alter ego.

Phoebe Waller-Bridge, the 33-year-old creator of two award-winning
television shows, Fleabag and Killing Eve, is drinking camomile tea,
looking delightfully prim in her ribbed black polo neck, make-up-free,
with glossy hair and neatly manicured fingernails. We are discussing the
sexual demands she would make of her partners in her 20s. `I was always
really open about sex and how I was feeling about it. In every
relationship I went into, I was like, "We are going to be honest about
this! Was that all right for you?"' She insists the men in her life were
not shocked by this straightforward approach. `No, on the whole they
were relieved.'

[Generation Z]

The Pew Research Center, a nonprofit group that specializes in measuring
public opinion across demographic groups, recently announced that it had
settled on what to call the "post-*millennial*" generation born from
about 1997 to 2012. Taking its cue from popular usage, Pew will apply
the label "Generation Z," or "Gen Z" for short.

In the basement of the Natural History Museum, past Shackleton's
Antarctic rock collection and beside a meteorite as old as the Earth
itself, there is a box and some instructions (Tom Whipple writes).

The box, the instructions explain, is to be looked after until June 30,
2514. And when we finally reach that day the longest experiment in
microbiology will come to an end.

Young would-be property owners were given a leg-up this week when
Lloyds, a high street bank, launched a 100 per cent mortgage for
first-time buyers — provided that their parents are happy to help out.

The benefit is that parents don't have to give their children any money.
Instead they are obliged to put 10 per cent of the property's value into
a three-year savings account with the bank. The parents are rewarded
with 2.5 per cent interest on their savings, while their child gets a
mortgage rate of 2.99 per cent — the lowest for this type of loan.

Two new ways of managing money are the latest in a series of enticements
to convince people to switch current accounts. N26, an online "mobile
bank", has launched a premium account, while First Direct unveiled a new
social media payment system, fdpay. Other companies, meanwhile, are
winning our custom with cold hard cash.

Arno is a professional footballer, Nora is a top dancer - and an
award-winning film inspired by her life is dividing audiences. Mark
Smith meets the fabulous Monsecour twins

Nora and Arno Monsecour are Disney-star gorgeous siblings: a mesmerising
diptych of generous smiles, clear blue eyes and dewy skin stretched over
the same fine, thoughtful features. Nora says she's a touch taller than
Arno, but their body language is so arrestingly complementary (they have
a habit of high-fiving when they say the same thing simultaneously) that
you immediately think of identical twins.

What a revolutionary and brave thing to feature a white male candidate
on the Jan. 20 Washington Post Magazine cover ["What if a *millennial*
became president?"]. Bravo! Forget about the fact that the recent
midterms were a landmark in women and minorities being elected to public
office; the answer to the Democratic Party's future success definitely
is another white guy who looks vaguely like Michael Dukakis. He's
exactly the demographic and type of candidate who really needs more
coverage. Yes. I can feel the change already stirring in the air.

Lisa Dunick, Bristow

As a dog with two tails, or if you prefer more modern, like *millennial*
with unlimited data plan. So happy was Frank Kudelka with the arrival of
Gabriel Torres to the "U". It is that the coach of the Blues believes
that the Panamanian can occupy any area of the attack, even if he broke
it as a center forward in Huachipato.

"Torres can give us mobility, even starting from the left. Maybe he does
not have the characteristics of a good player, but that is not the
reason why we are going to demean what he has, which is a lot ", he
liked the bullfighting strategist.

As part of my vague aspirations towards self-improvement - which fall
short of doing things that might extend my life, like giving up wine, or
revisiting the crossfit class I was so enthusiastic about for five
minutes last year - I recently decided to start journaling. Bullet
journaling, to be all *millennial* about it.

A bullet journal - or #bujo if you give it the full beards-and-avocados
treatment - is basically a pretentious name for a collection of To Do
lists inside a nice notebook. If you had a fancy paper collection when
you were eight, you're the target market.

Shivan and Narresh, Delhi-based designer duo famed for their creative
resort wear will showcase their latest collection titled ‘Patu Series'
at the Lakme Fashion Week Summer/Resort 2019. A fusion of Indian art and
modern silhouettes, the collection captures the sublime elements of
Bengal's Pattachitra art and juxtaposes it with the intrinsic Tholu
Bommalata leather puppetry of Andhra Pradesh. The Patu Series, is a
seamless melange of the two tribal art forms, reveals Shivan Bhatiya,
head designer at Shivan and Narresh. “Pattachitra depicts the tribal art
of Bengal and the Tholu Bommalata art renders shadow puppetry on
leather, which is the foundation for the series. The key highlights of
this line are six new prints — Panthera, Sunderbans, Iconorosh, Fagun,
Urvi, and Deccan — rendered on this season's swim, resort and
celebration silhouettes,” he elaborates.

Arianne Phillips, the Oscar-nominated costume designer who became a
public name thanks to her work with Madonna, hit her long dark night of
the red carpet soul a few years ago.

“I was completely burned out on GoFundMe and tired of feeling like a
resister solely on social media,” she said on the phone from Los
Angeles, where she had just finished working on “Once Upon a Time in
Hollywood,” the new Quentin Tarantino film. “I kept thinking: What does
all this waste and excess amount to?”
