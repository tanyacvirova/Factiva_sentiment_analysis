HYDERABAD: As India awakes to the year of being the youngest nation
globally, the message of its youth is loud and clear — Say no to
armchair activism. Unwilling to sit back in their cushy drawing rooms
and watch the world go by, they vow to hit the streets in larger
numbers, in the new decade, and live more closely by the Mahatma’s words
— Be the change you want to see in the world… This rearing- to-go
attitude was on full display at The Times of India’s 'Times Aspire 2020:
Young Leaders’ Conclave’ that brought together 10 bright minds from
across areas of study and work — each of whom will celebrate their 20th
birthday in 2020. The event was partnered by the Indian School of
Business (ISB). From taking small steps towards fighting climate change
to raising awareness about the need for safer public spaces and
supporting each other through their entrepreneurial journey, these
representatives of 'Young India’, pledged to contribute to every issue
that promises a better tomorrow.

Australians – have entered 2020 with a “Christmas debt hangover”.

Financial technology tools help planners to be more effective and efficient

Financial advisers are constantly pelted with offers to try new
“fintech” products. These tools promise to help planners with everything
from assessing risk to educating clients to rebalancing portfolios. Some
come with hefty price tags or steep learning curves; others are
inexpensive and easy to use with plug-and-play accessibility. The
challenge is sifting through all the offerings to determine which ones
merit serious consideration.

EDMONTON -- At 38 years old, Matthew Schneider is technically a millennial.

Born a year earlier, he would have belonged to generation X. Being so
close to the line made him question which camp he belongs to, so he
looked it up online.

This is the third in our six-part series on Lodestar UM's study Wave X
Remix Culture that analyses the four most influential shifts shaping the
modern consumer - Resist, Retrograde, Reglocalise and Recreate. Wave X
explains how these shifts also served as pillars of a framework that
enabled marketers to understand cultural trends and identify the
territories brands should play in, audiences to target and media
platforms they interact with. As the 21st century enters the 20s, brands
are often advised to look at future trends and predictions. However,
consumers also return to decades gone by to relive memories. What should
brands do in a world where the past often co-exists with the future?

Wave X takes a close look at the Retrograde pillar, exploring the shift
towards authenticity and nostalgia and the role of digital in bringing
past decades of music, art and culture within easy reach of the current
generation.

MUMBAI: 2019 was all about implementation and the impact of new tariff
order (NTO). It has been a year of disruption and innovation for the
industry. Overall it was a challenging year for niche channels but
throughout the year, channels made various efforts to overcome them and
retain its consumer base. Going forward in 2020, leading English GECs,
Zee CafA and Colors Infinity, plan to offer innovative and engaging
content to strengthen their subscriber base. The sector hopes for
stability and positive growth in the broadcast industry.

"NTO implemented in Feb 2019 impacted reach and ad sales and
broadcasters have been managing this change to get to a new equilibrium.
We hope proposed tweaks to the regulation will further help stability,"
says Times Network MD and CEO MK Anand. "Consolidation in the M&E sector
will continue in FY'20. This will have a positive impact on cost
efficiencies and the overall competitiveness of the broadcast industry."

SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO / ACCESSWIRE / January 2, 2020 / Starting a
business and making it successful is never an easy task. You have to go
through some significant challenges that may seem impossible to
overcome, which is why most fail at it. However, some people thrive in
their businesses and end up providing sources of inspiration to many
others. Most top entrepreneurs have a sad background, but the fact that
they overcame all of their struggles to make it big in their respective
industries is admirable.

By personally representing hundreds of operators who have sold their
companies, I'm aware of the many different reasons owners decide it's
time to exit. The number one and two reasons has always been typical.
Retirement and health issues. But now, 26 years after my first
transaction, I find a new situation that has caused those top reasons to
change: An operator's difficulty in hiring and retaining dedicated
employees who can effectively support the company's operations.

In the past 12 months alone, out of 11 different listings for the sale
of a company, five owners told me they were selling because they
couldn't find good employees. In fact, three of these owners were under
the age of 50 and not close to retirement but decided they could not
continue operating under these conditions. What has caused this shortage
of good personnel? Let's look at some of the reasons here.

Brizfeel, a consumer advocacy and research organization, conducted a
survey of over 30,000 people ages 18-65 in September of 2018.1 The
survey revealed that 57 percent of consumers prefer to shop online and
spend about five hours a week doing so, while an additional 12 percent
are as open to online shopping as they are to brick-and-mortar shopping.
About a third of consumers cite the "24/7" availability of online
shopping as the biggest reason to shop that way, followed by the ability
to find a lower price quickly, convenience, and the ability to save
time. Additionally, LIMRA continues to report an insurance gap of $12
trillion nationally, including a $6 trillion gap among Generations X and
Y. In fact, 41 percent of Gen Xers don't have any life insurance, while
nearly half of *Gen Y* doesn't.3 Combined, these two generations
represent 61 percent of the adult population in America.

Millennials[https://www.businessinsider.com/category/millennials?utm_source=dowjones&utm_medium=ingest]
have been blamed for killing everything from beer to
napkins[https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-hurt-industries-sales-2018-10?utm_source=dowjones&utm_medium=ingest]
over the past decade.

* "Millennials are killing" headlines faced backlash as it became clear
that the generation wasn't choosing to kill industries. Millennials have
a bleaker economic reality than older generations.
