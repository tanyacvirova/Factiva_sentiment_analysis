As the new year stretches ahead — with new opportunities to change
things up — consider how you can invest in a way that doesn't conflict
with your ethics, and advances the causes you care about.

It's something a growing number of investors are considering.

NEW YORK — Regina King sparkled in rose blush by Alberta Ferretti,
Nicole Kidman wore a form-fitting liquid oxblood gown by Michael Kors
Collection and Sandra Oh wore a couple of standout old Hollywood looks,
but the Golden Globes’ return to red carpet color after last year’s
protest in black was led by Lady Gaga in powerhouse periwinkle.

The pop star and Ally to Bradley Cooper’s Jackson in “A Star is Born”
honored an outfit Judy Garland wore when she starred in a 1954 version
of the film, with Gaga showing off a more contemporary twist in bulbous
sleeves that hit just above the elbows and were attached to a
ground-skimming cape. She had a bluish-purple updo to match.

2019 is promising to be that year when goals are reached and targets
smashed. Unfortunately, it’s easy to get your head stuck in the big
picture and forget that the most important aims in life revolve around
you. The good thing is it has never been easier to make small changes in
your lifestyle and diet to leave you feeling more virtuous than a
*millennial* after a 5:00AM yoga class.

With over three quarters of Brits launching their new year’s resolutions
as we speak,* a cynic might say we truly are a nation that likes to set
ourselves up for a fall. The reality is that we simply want some more of
that wholesome nutritious eating to get us fighting fit from morning to
bed time.

Generation Y might view saving for their first property as an impossible
task, but we can set you on the right path

To save the average 10 per cent deposit of £21,966 on a first home,
millennials would need to forgo 9,000 takeaway lattes, or 21,700
avocados, according to Really Moving, a comparison website. Yet
millennials are far from a free-spending generation, saving more as a
percentage of their earnings than any other age bracket, according to
Yolt, a money-management app. If you are saving for a deposit, don’t get
bogged down by unhelpful statistics about fruit and coffee and instead
follow these tips.

Ralph Lauren Fragrances is placing its next bet for Romance on the
real-life kind.

Since its 1999 launch, Romance has been a top seller for Ralph
Lauren Fragrances. The perfume, which retails for $96 for 100-ml., is
the brand’s number-one women’s fragrance in the U.S. As it enters its
20th year, the scent is getting a refresh — one that industry sources
estimate will bring in $80 million at retail in its first year.

Here we are, in the hard light of January, wading through dried-out pine
needles, gifts to return, garbage bags filled with crinkled paper and
already-abandoned resolutions of getting organized.

I don't make resolutions, personally, because most of them fail and I'm
not into self-flagellation, but sometime in the middle of 2018,
following a series of the typical calamities that turned my home and
schedule and brain into scrambled eggs, I decided it was time (finally,
finally, finally) to become really organized, for real.

Kim's Convenience is important for many reasons, but for my mixed-race
daughter, writes Hilary Hahn, it's especially poignant

My *millennial* daughter has a new favourite TV show. In the fierce
competition for her attention, it has managed to entice her away for
23-minute periods streamed online to the exclusion of all else. It's not
Stranger Things or 13 Reasons Why. It's Kim's Convenience.

In a society that is increasingly becoming paperless, a home printer is
still top on a parent's mind - both for homework as well as the
experiential learning needs of their children.

Beyond facilitating homework prints, a consumer-grade printer today has
to be a cost-efficient device that is wireless, can be connected from a
smartphone and helps in running a small business.

The news of dwindling iPhone sales has brought the focus back on Apple
Inc., which until recently prided itself for its unstoppable success
run. The company which was once an inspiration for marketers is now
grappling with its sales strategy, not just in India, but globally too.
In order to fathom the reason behind Apple's sales dip, we spoke to some
experts who attributed some keys factors responsible for this state of
affairs.

16-megapixel rear camera, 8-megapixel front camera, and a 3,000mAh
battery. The smartphone also comes with LG's proprietary Quad DAC
technology and Boombox speaker. The Q9 also has FM radio support to
utilise the onboard audio technologies to entertain users while
on-the-go. Furthermore, there is an IP68-certified build that is based
on MIL-STD 810G military standard.

This article was originally published in September 2018. Sally Rooney
has become the youngest ever winner of the Costa Novel
award[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/01/07/youngest-ever-costa-book-prize-winner-sally-rooney-claims-victory/]
.

"I have no idea if I’ll write another book," says Sally Rooney, sitting
in the bar of a Dublin hotel with a pot of tea and a bucketload of
doubt. “Maybe I am one of those people who writes two novels in their
twenties then never writes anything else again.” When, on publication of
Rooney’s 2017 debut Conversations with
Friends[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/what-to-read/50-best-books-2017/5-conversations-friends-sally-rooney-faber/],
her editor compared the young Irish novelist to J D Salinger, I’m not
sure this is what she had in mind.

'Confusion' over Bikini models may seem to be an odd catalyst for
wanting a more representative political spectrum, but the only reason
the largest daily newspaper in NZ can run this fucking pap is because
there are so few alternatives for NZ news.

ROYAL Bank of Scotland has acquired a 25% stake in a
*millennial*-focused technology start-up as it rallies against new
digital challenger banks vying to take millions of customers away.

The state-owned lender has invested £2 million in Loot, following an

Ispent yesterday applying for a new job. Luckily, I knew just what to
say in my cover letter. "I like to think of myself as a me, me, me
*millennial*," I wrote. "Friends would describe me as the class clown
and a selfie-addicted snowflake. Hobbies include sitting up all night
playing video games."

Except I didn't write any of that. Nobody would set out to insult
themselves in a job application, and anyway, any employer who received
such a letter would swiftly scrunch it into a ball and catapult it into
the nearest bin. Or so you might think.

Tackling misconduct head on, a focus on ethics and home working are some
of the themes for 2019, says Sophie Christie

The workplace continues to evolve as employers strive to keep up with
the latest technological advances and the demands of today's workforce.
Last year we predicted that artificial intelligence, upskilling and an
older workforce would be a few of the standout trends in 2018.

Anne Helen Petersen’s article on ‘errand paralysis’ hit a nerve. For
millennials, there is no existence outside work

An anonymous Manhattan lawyer tells us in Herman Melville’s Bartleby,
the Scrivener[https://www.bartleby.com/129/] of a perplexing turning
point in the short story, where Bartleby one day stops following orders
and instead responds: “I would prefer not to.” The action is
unconscionable, both disobeying orders but also having no clear prompt
or reasoning for the sudden change of heart. The phrase has become
famous and, in the modern way, sloganised. A friend of mine has it on a
tote bag and T-shirt. It can be found in many saleable formats for
millennials.

BEIJING--North Korean leader Kim Jong Un arrived in China, North Korea's
main backer, as he sent mixed signals to the U.S. about his willingness
to give up his nuclear weapons ahead of a possible second summit with
President Trump.

Mr. Kim began his China visit on Monday at the invitation of Chinese
President Xi Jinping and plans to stay in the country through Thursday,
official North Korean and Chinese news agencies reported early Tuesday.
Mr. Kim traveled by train accompanied by his wife, Ri Sol Ju, and senior
officials, North Korean state media said.

Liz Connor speaks to experts to find out why millennials are opting for
sobriety

From pint-filled freshers weeks to tequila-fuelled Club 18-30 holidays,
it's safe to say that being in your 20s used to be synonymous with
unbridled binge drinking. But the tides are turning on young people's
love for booze as many seek out healthier lifestyles.

Sloganeering and symbolism are very effective and critical tools used by
marketing experts to attract and retain the attention of their targeted
audience. They are conceived with a view to ingraining messages into the
memories of targeted audience through their catchy or clever appellation.

AS MULTINATIONALS struggle to satisfy fickle consumers, compete against
agile local players and keep up with disruptive digital technologies,
they are discovering that bold moves rather than incremental solutions
open doors to better opportunities.

Over the years, “volatility, uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity” (VUCA)
has forced multinationals to re-examine their business models. The
challenge has been to create change and quickly adapt to a dynamic
marketplace further disrupted by technology.

Mergers among asset managers are set to continue at "heightened" levels
in 2019, according to consultants, as the industry battles headwinds.

Alongside pressure on profit margins from falling fund fees and
increased regulatory costs, U.K. companies also find themselves easier
targets for foreign buyers thanks to a Brexit-weakened pound, according
to a Jan 2 note from Alpha FMC, an asset-management consultancy.

Just last month, Benchmark Brewing Co. was on the verge of selling its
operations following an eviction notice from its landlord. Thankfully,
the Grantville headquartered brewery (it also owns a tasting room in Bay
Park), with the help of its attorneys, was able to remain at its
location. But, Kearny Mesa's Council Brewing Co. didn't have the same
luck. In December, Council, with a second location - a tasting room in
Santee - officially shut its doors after declining sales.

Like Council Brewing Co., many breweries and tasting rooms in San Diego
have been closing the last couple of years. CraftBeerinSanDiego.com
recently reported that from 2016 through July 2018, 30 craft beer
locations closed in the county. This includes La Jolla Brewing,
Oceanside Ale Works and O'Sullivan's, among a long list of others.

A search on the San Diego Distillers Guild website indicates there are
approximately 15 craft distilleries as members in the county. According
to the American Craft Spirits Association 2018 annual report, California
leads in the number of craft spirits distilleries in the country with
156, up from 148 the year prior.

What's driving craft distilleries to mushroom overall is millennials.
But, what's pushing the growth in the region is relatively new
legislation that has loosened restrictions on distillers, including
allowing them to sell products straight to consumers and an increase in
the total volume distillers can produce a year.

Millennials comprise the largest cohort of homebuyers as most have
entered their prime purchasing years, and they just might shake up
migration patterns in 2019, according to First American Financial Corp .

Financially, millennials seem to be in better positions than other
generations when they were the same age. Millennials in their 30s have
higher median incomes than baby boomers did in their 30s, and they're
set to surpass Gen-Xers in the same capacity, according to First American.

New Delhi, Jan. 7 -- Other than renting a house, the traditional mindset
has always been to purchase. And for big ticket possessions like a car,
the purchase is accompanied by a lot of fanfare and pride. But enter
*millennial* India and the concept of purchase has taken a back seat,
and renting or leasing is the new normal.

The concept of leasing is here to stay-the increasing number of
start-ups that help you rent nearly everything under the sun are
testimony to this-and it is fast catching up even when it comes to
vehicles. It started with corporate leasing initially for senior
executives in multinational companies, being practised by luxury
carmakers. But it has slowly become the norm in corporate India and the
concept is now going retail with companies such as Mahindra and Mahindra
offering some of their models on lease directly to customers.

When Polk Stanley Wilcox works with out-of-state architects on a big
project, as it did on the Robinson Center renovation and the Arkansas
Arts Center, who decides who does what? We have partnered with several
wonderful firms around the country who are like-minded in design and
client service and who complement our practice. These projects are
collaborative, but specific work is assigned according to who has the
most relevant expertise to address certain aspects of the project. This
may be overall design guidance or the oversight of particular technical
issues. Sometimes we lead and manage the project as we did on the
Robinson Center, and other times we play more of a support role, as on
the Arkansas Arts Center. The goal is to give the client a unified
design team that can provide a holistic approach.

Originally published March 19, 2018

Did the housing crisis of 2008 make any permanent changes in the
apartment market? Absolutely. The problems in the single-family industry
after the housing crisis of 2008 made people recognize that
single-family housing should be bought as a place to live instead of
simply as an investment to create net worth. More and more potential
first-time homebuyers opted to continue to rent an apartment instead of
buying that first house, making the apartment market stronger.
*Millennial* are an example of prime renters who are less likely to buy
a house because of issues like student loan debt. Rental demand from
this demographic is expected to remain robust. In addition, demographics
have meant a boom in apartment living with a whole new renter pool,
including empty nesters, divorced people, the elderly and downsizers.

Photograph by 10'000 Hours

Not so very long ago, corporate executives commuted to a gleaming
headquarters building, often in a beautifully landscaped suburban
campus. Greeted by attentive security guards and smiling receptionists,
they walked down well-appointed hallways lined with mahogany paneling
and expensive artwork to their offices on the executive floor. There,
they reviewed petitions that had percolated up the ladder, and
dispatched decisions to be executed by the army of troops on the front
lines. After decades of hard work, these individuals had ascended to the
top of their pyramid, overseeing the processes and practices that made
the enterprise work, and enjoying all the perquisites and power of a
C-suite functional officer in the corporate center of a major company.

Independent vehicle repair shops will be seeing growing numbers of older
vehicles, import brands and light trucks and CUV/SUVs pulling into their
service bays in the coming years, according to market analysts.

IHS Markit and NPD Group Inc. analysts, during presentations at the 2018
Automotive Aftermarket Products Expo (AAPEX), both noted these trends in
the vehicle parc can have a positive impact on the automotive
aftermarket for those who adapt their operations and marketing strategies.

Is the financial advice industry aware that the services we pay for are
rarely pleasant experiences?

Everything from finding an adviser and opening an account to moving
money and getting questions answered are, more often than not, awful
encounters. I was shocked recently at how much snail mail was involved
in my own 401(k) rollover. I'm currently involved in a week-long
engagement to transfer $200 from PayPal to my bank. Don't even get me
started on insurance.

Chicago's wild race for mayor finally had seemed to settle into an at
least semi-predictable mold, not over but headed to a likely conclusion.
Then Eddie Burke happened.

With a big field of candidates surviving petition challenges, the heavy
favorites according to both the polls and political insiders were two of
the better-known contenders: Toni Preckwinkle and Susana Mendoza. There
was an outside chance that Bill Daley or one of the relatively
conservative white guys who are running could make it to the runoff
election—and an even more outside chance that someone different like
Amara Enyia could claw her way in. That's how it looked.

In 2018, Meredith Corp. made publishing history by swallowing Time Inc.,
a transformative $2.8 billion acquisition that formally closed last January.

Meredith was already home to glossy brands, including Better Homes and
Gardens, Family Circle, Martha Stewart Living and Traditional Home, that
resonate in the heartland. But in taking on Time Inc. titles including
People, InStyle and Real Simple, it dramatically deepened its reach,
offering marketers a cross-brand, multimedia platform that connects with
175 million American consumers each month, including 80 percent of
*millennial* women.

Many of the hot brands in retail today didn't exist a decade ago. But
now, backed by big-time venture capital, new direct-to-consumer players
are making enough waves in the retail landscape that heritage players
are forced to pay attention. Larger brands caught dueling for consumer
dollars might do well to adopt some of the marketing strategies that
startup brands have deployed from infancy.

"Almost every category has these venture-funded, young, agile startups
that are proving how effective they are at taking market share," says
Terence Kawaja, founder and CEO of Luma Partners, a digital media and
marketing-focused advisory firm. "It behooves every major marketer to
take a look at what they're doing."

Denim is in a playful mood.

Brands presented spring immediates, summer lines and sneak peaks of
their fall denim collections at Project Womens and Fame in New York this

*HD* 	How 1970s "It" Girl Eve Babitz Became Young Hollywood's Latest
Obsession

For decades, Eve Babitz was one of Hollywood's best-kept literary
secrets. A onetime "It" girl who had affairs with Harrison Ford, Paul
and Ed Ruscha, and Jim Morrison; partied with Mick Jagger, Jack
Nicholson and Sharon Tate; designed album covers for The Byrds and posed
naked for an iconic photo with artist Marcel Duchamp, she wrote
"fiction" from the '70s through the '90s that mirrored her adventures —
earning praise from none other than Joan Didion.

"Look, had I not come along, somebody else would have," says Lili
Anolik, the author of Hollywood's Eve (out Jan. 8 from Simon & Schuster,
$26), a book on Babitz that is part biography, part cultural analysis
and part memoir. "Her story is so great."

Realistic Charm To Adulting

SPOILER ALERT: This article contains details from the premiere episode
of Good Trouble. Gone are the days of the enjoyably schmaltzy and
sugar-coated melodramatic coming-of-age series about young adulthood (I
love me some Dawson’s Creek) and welcome to a new era of
*millennial*-driven shows that are inclusive and tackle issues that
don’t play out like “lesson of the week” but rather give us a fresh —
and much-needed — perspective of the modern world we live in today
(Bi-sexuality! Race relations! Women in the workplace!). With
Freeform’s Good Trouble, a spin-off of The Fosters, we see all of this
and it’s done in a way that isn’t pandering or forced. Instead, it’s
appropriate with heartfelt charm and feels like it didn’t come from an
older, uninformed TV exec that said: “this is how kids talk, right?”

NAPERVILLE, Illinois, Jan. 7 -- This is the year millennials surpass
Baby Boomers as the largest living adult generation. These new consumers
come along just at the right time, as insurers search for growth in a
challenging insurance market. But where to start? Instec's new e-book
explains what makes millennials tick and how to play to their wants and
needs.

The new publication, titled The Insurer's *Millennial* Playbook: How to
Capitalize on the Generational Shift, describes a generation shaped by
economic shocks and technological advances. Instec explains how these
two factors influence the way millennials think and act on a purchase
decision.

Srinagar, Jan. 7 -- To somebody interested in "History of philosophical
thought", the appearance of existentialism on the scene represents a
paradigmatic heresy. It indeed represents an inversion of entire
philosophical project as, in the words of Sartre "Existence precedes
essence", represents precise antagonism towards the classical
philosophical project. Existentialism has been, for last few decades,
gaining currency not only as an academic affair but as "weltanschauung"
in the lives of almost all of us. It has come to dominate not only the
way we look at the world, but more importantly defines the prism by
which we analyse our own selves and personal lives. It has had its
influence on art, religion, morality, science, economy, polity and
almost all other aspects of human existence. It has taught man not to
surrender to the "Placebo of Myths" or any archetypes defined and
identified historically, for this it describes as inauthentic life and
bad faith.

Dance like nobody's watching, they say. The young university student
must have had that on her mind as she and a couple of friends filmed
themselves re-enacting a famous scene from a movie.

Now Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a US Congresswoman, the unofficial
leader of the American left, and probably the highest profile
*millennial* politician in the world.

WASHINGTON -- Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is in the final
stages of deciding whether to run for president and has told allies he
is skeptical the other Democrats eyeing the White House can defeat
President Trump, an assessment that foreshadows a clash between the
veteran Washington insider and the more liberal and fresh-faced
contenders for the party's 2020 nomination.

Many Democratic voters, and nearly all major Democratic donors, are
keenly interested in Mr. Biden's plans because of their consuming focus
on finding a candidate who can beat a president they believe represents
a threat to American democracy. But there is also a rising demand in the
party for a more progressive standard-bearer who reflects the
increasingly diverse Democratic coalition.

A Scots Guardsman says he is planning to quit the army after his picture
was used below the words “snow flake” in a controversial ad campaign.

Stephen McWhirter, 28, slammed the army advertisement posters and told
colleagues he was not told his photo would be used in this way.

One of Brad Haley’s goals at IHOP over the past 18 months has been to
unlock what he called the “latent love” for the chain.

Since its launch in Los Angeles in 1958, IHOP has been a symbol of
Americana. But in more recent times, the DineEquity brand had struggled
to stand out in the hyper-competitive world of sit-down restaurants.

2019 JAN 7 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at
Global Warming Focus -- Research findings on Global Warming and Climate
Change are discussed in a new report. According to news originating from
Brussels, Belgium, by VerticalNews correspondents, research stated,
"Even if anthropogenic warming were constrained to less than 2 degrees C
above pre-industrial, the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets will
continue to lose mass this century, with rates similar to those observed
over the past decade."

Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Brussels
Free University, "However, nonlinear responses cannot be excluded, which
may lead to larger rates of mass loss. Furthermore, large uncertainties
in future projections still remain, pertaining to knowledge gaps in
atmospheric (Greenland) and oceanic (Antarctica) forcing."

the subject of a report. According to news originating from Mount
Vernon, Iowa, by VerticalNews correspondents, research stated, "Close
coupling of Iberian hydroclimate and North Atlantic sea surface
temperature (SST) during recent glacial periods has been identified
through the analysis of marine sediment and pollen grains co-deposited
on the Portuguese continental margin. While offering precisely
correlatable records, these time series have lacked a directly dated,
site-specific record of continental Iberian climate spanning multiple
glacial cycles as a point of comparison."

I never take for granted the opportunity to teach my kids important life
lessons on the ranch as we continue our family tradition in production
agriculture[https://www.beefmagazine.com/ranching/stuck-rut-letter-could-help-family-ranch-move-forward].

Getting to work alongside my husband and my parents each and every day
is a blessing. While we aren’t perfect, I think as *Millennial*
producers we bring new ideas, energy and skilled labor to the business.
Meanwhile, my Baby Boomer parents are valuable in their wisdom,
stability, security, support and seasoned advice.

BuzzFeed News and Twitter are bringing back *millennial*-targeted
morning talk show “AM to DM” for at least another year — claiming the
show now averages 400,000 views per episode.

The partners say the renewal of “AM to DM,” through the end of 2019, is
an indication of its success in delivering a new take on the morning TV
show format. In the hour-long weekday show, hosts Saeed Jones (above
left) and Isaac Fitzgerald (right) highlight trending tweets, banter
about the biggest news stories of the day, and interview guests and experts.

The president was pictured helping the Orange Democratic Movement leader

(Yicai Global) Jan. 7 -- Huace Film & TV, a leading Chinese movie
production company, has seen more than CNY2 billion (USD291.2 million)
erased from its market value in the space of just three days following
scathing reviews of its art house movie, Long Day's Journey Into Night.

The company's shares [SHE:300133] plunged almost 9 percent on Jan. 2 to
CNY8.06 (USD1.17) each, and fell again the next day. The stock has
recovered some ground today, nudging up 0.3 percent, to value the
Hangzhou-based firm at CNY13.9 billion (USD2 billion).

The retail industry is buzzing with the potential of applying
personalization, artificial intelligence and big data to capture the
*Millennial* consumer, and since they possess the largest annual
spending power of any generation — a hefty $200 billion — we can
understand why.

This digitally native cohort is shaking up the game. They are demanding
personalized experiences but are concerned about data privacy. Many
brands have yet to find the recipe that quells worries over privacy
while delivering more meaningful one-to-one experiences.

What a ride it’s been for the humble minibar. What once encapsulated the
excitement of a stay in a hotel room - a miniature world of expensive
possibilities - is now washed up, found out and neglected.

We used to scoff at the prices, tittering at the brazen calculations
that led a single bottle of Heineken to cost £7, offended, but in a sort
of faux deliberate, amusing way because we knew no one in their right
mind would actually consume it at that price.

SATAN is about to be let loose one more time, according to a shocking
prophecy in the Bible that foresees the Devil’s return to Earth.

After the 1000 years have ended in the Millennium Kingdom, two
additional things must happen before the new Heaven and Earth are
created, according to scripture. The holy text adds that these two
events will seal the fate of Satan and all of the unsaved people who
have ever lived once and for all. When Jesus comes back for the second
time to set up His Millennium Kingdom for a thousand years, the Bible
tells us that Satan is chained up in the bottomless pit during those
thousand years.

Opinion Writing I take advantage of my holidays at the end of the year
to write and research about the daily life of the writer. Scrutinizing
in my readings I have found several passages of writers, journalists and
poets about a life that contrasts with the concept that is traditionally
held about them, often the product of a non-reading society and from
that uneducated point of view. Understood the concept as flaws in the
integration with life, does not have to see if you are professional or
scarce letters. The best example is given by José Saramago when he says
that his great teacher of wisdom was his illiterate grandfather. The
lack of life causes that the qualifier of poet is confused with modoso,
without office, vagabond, foreign to his reality. Prejudice that in the
long run has high cultural cost. But let's look at a few examples,
because I have found many cases that illustrate the opposite of prejudice.

m {249364} What is the importance of Mexico for American Express?

It is very important, since it was the first country in which we operate
internationally. Our relationship is very strong and solid, not only
because of the proximity to the United States but because of the brand's
recognition and the quality of service that has placed American Express
among the highest standards in the financial sector.

LONDON — With big luxury booming, Instagram pumping fashion and the male
consumer choosier than ever, Harrods is making its largest investment to
date in a men’s wear floor that aims to capture what is becoming a
golden moment for the industry.

Men’s Superbrands partially opened in December with 19 boutiques
including Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Prada, Balenciaga and Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is the first of a seven-phase project that will see men’s wear and
sports live on the same floor, rather than scattered around the store,
and is meant to mirror Women’s Superbrands, which opened in 2015.

SunTrust survey finds half of couples don't discuss finances before
getting married, even though 88% agree they should

ATLANTA, Jan. 7, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- The holidays are one of the most
popular times for engagements. As newly engaged couples begin planning
for their big day and the rest of their lives together, many are
avoiding a topic they know is important -- their finances. A new
SunTrust survey conducted by The Harris Poll found that 88 percent of
Americans believe it is important to have financial conversations before
saying "I do," yet only 51 percent actually discussed how they would
handle finances before getting married. In fact, less than half of
married couples disclosed their annual salaries (41 percent) and debt
(36 percent) before walking down the aisle.

If you are over 50 and were a desktop computer user in the 1980s,
chances are you have a few floppy disks lying around — with photos or
documents that you saved, every time you changed your PC. Today, chances
are you can no longer open the floppy — and the contents are as good as
lost.

Don't make the mistake of your elders: We all have precious memories we
want to leave our children — in a form they can enjoy. Free cloud
storage is as good as it goes — but capacity is usually limited to 20 GB
or so and it is difficult to 'hand over' an email account. Your own
physical storage hardware is still a good option, but there are a few
caveats:

desire to work in an aesthetically appealing environment have spurred
demand for collaborative workspaces in India.

Maya (Jennifer Lopez) has a problem: she’s lied her way into a
high-powered job, and it’s only a matter of time before she gets found
out. Maya has a dazzling CV, laying out her Harvard education and
impressive achievements – but in fact it’s all lies, she’s never even
been to college (it’s not her fault! it was her geeky-*millennial*
godson who came up with the idea). The CV also claims that Maya speaks
Mandarin, so when an important client arrives from China the company
naturally asks her to take him to dinner and translate for the rest of
the team. Maya agrees – but of course she doesn’t speak a word of
Mandarin. Her goose is cooked!

Going full vegan: from what you eat, to what you put on your feet

If you have committed to a vegan lifestyle, you’ve got to walk the vegan
walk, and that requires shoes made without animal by-products or
materials, such as leather, suede, wool, shearling, silk or fur.

For social media's biggest players, 2018 represented a trying year.
Simmering issues with privacy and data integrity came to a boil at
Facebook, with effects felt at the highest levels of government.
Networks in the crosshairs of Congressional investigations have had to
reckon with their own power and potential for abuse, while users have
been left to question the larger impact of social media on politics,
culture and civic discourse.

What does this mean for 2019? How will users and networks respond to
these seismic shifts? How will the way companies use social media evolve
in light of changing attitudes on privacy and meaningful connection? In
our annual Social Trends Report(
http://ht.ly/thFH30mX4CP[http://ht.ly/thFH30mX4CP] ), Hootsuite surveyed
more than 3,000 businesses, from small agencies to huge enterprises, to
see how they plan to adapt in 2019. Here are some of the most salient
findings and a look into the crystal ball on what the year ahead holds.
