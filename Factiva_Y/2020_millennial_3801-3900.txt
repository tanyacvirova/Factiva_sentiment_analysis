NEW YORK, Jan. 13, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- This season, luxury lifestyle
and accessories brand MCM debuts with its first Lounge & Sleepwear
collection. Rooted in the brand's travel heritage and interpreted for
the modern nomad, the directional nature of the collection allows MCM to
embrace a 21st century point of view when it comes to identity and
inclusivity.

Designed with comfort in mind while also embracing the boldness and
colourful energy that has defined MCM since its birth in 1976, the
Mulberry silk loungewear collection includes a reversible robe, pajama
sets, drawstring and sleep shorts, boxers, and sleep masks. The colour
scheme is classic and full of attitude, all in an eye-catching cognac
with black accents. Each piece showcases the MCM logo throughout via the
letters or the MCM signature Visetos print. The Lounge & Sleepwear
collection pairs well with the new MCM Underwear collection (also
launching this season) as well as other existing product categories.

My oldest daughter turned 19 years old this week so I did what any
self-respecting father with a still (moderately) functioning liver would
do: I had a few drinks.

But my kid didn't.

Dr Kris Naudts prefers to sit facing the room. There are two yellow
swivel chairs in the shrink-turned-entrepreneur’s new offices in Mayfair
and I had picked the wrong one. We swap, and the 46-year-old resettles,
crossing his legs and tilting his head. I wonder if it is a
psychological power play from the former psychiatrist whose management
style has been criticised, but maybe that’s reading too much into it.

He is the founder and chief executive of travel site Culture Trip, which
offers insider guides to the best places to stay, eat, drink, and see
culture around the world. The site is written by around 600 local
freelancers, edited by an in-house team of over 300 and gets nearly 20
million visitors a month. Targeted at millennials, it claims to have
more online readers than Lonely Planet and Time Out.

I personally know almost all the New Zealand political figures in force
and in recent years, starting with former governor Fernando Canales
Clariond, with whom I shared the ancestor year several meetings around
Manuel Gómez Morin's campaign for the national presidency of the PAN.

Also former secretary of economy and energy in Fox's sixteenth, Canales,
as a good king, is a frank, knowledgey and honest-looking man. He had
the enormous virtue of being one of the first opposition governors,
before the priist hegemony was defeated nationally, however, like Pacho
Barrio in Chihuahua and Patrón Laviada in Yucatan, he could not achieve
continuity, although the debate about who really loses an election when
he holds power, the ruler who failed to meet expectations, his party's
candidate, unable to fill the space, or both.

They're both just 26 years old, but Amy and Jake are already the parents
of a 10-month-old baby and a French bulldog. Their family lives in
Toronto's High Park area, renting a place for $1,830 per month. They had
to find it quickly - they were kicked out of their previous apartment
when the landlord's daughter needed a place to stay after university.

With no debts, they have dreams of buying a home outside the Greater
Toronto Area to start their family. But recently, Amy suffered health
problems that prevented her from returning to work after the pregnancy.
Now, they live on a single income of $70,000 - earned by Jake who's a
software developer.

Grandma Irene tried to reverse my precocious atheism by telling me
biblical stories. It did not achieve purpose, but it served me to learn
traditions and *millennial* wisdom. Reading many politicians and those
who these days declare themselves spokesmen for the people, women,
Mapuches, etc., I remembered the tower of Babel. After the universal
flood, Noah's descendants built a tower that was to reach the sky. God,
in punishment for human arrogance, made the builders each have their
language, so that they could not understand each other and abandon the
work. Thus explained the myth the emergence of languages and different
peoples, doomed not to understand each other.

standing up for yourself, while also learning to navigate the

bureaucracy can at times be maddening, but persevering does not only

path.

“I like gardening,” the novelist Alice Sebold once said. “It’s a place
where I find myself when I need to lose myself.” Nurturing mute, green
things offered similar solace to Telegraph journalist Alice Vincent
after her heart was broken in 2017. Her sprawling
recovery-through-horticulture memoir has the potential to become the
*millennial* generation’s answer to self-help books like Eat Pray
Love[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/lifestyle/wellbeing/7977510/Eat-Pray-Love.html].
A kind of Peat Prune Gloves.

The UK’s flower and indoor plant market is now reportedly worth £2.2
billion, with recent house plant sales up by 43 per cent in John Lewis
and a whopping 66 per cent in Ikea. Potted cacti, succulents, cheese
plants and ferns are the trendiest objects of desire for millennials
aspiring to transform their dingy – and eternally rented – flats into
urban jungles, purifying the polluted air they breathe, and calming the
anxiety of the *millennial* mind.

First came the tablescape, now the sinkscape. The former, a means of
finessing the landing strip down the centre of your dining table by way
of flowers, pine cones, glitter-sprayed gourds and candles, is reliant
on one attending the sort of dinners where guests aren't expected to
serve themselves the veg.

The latter, an Instagramworthy array of lotions, potions, conspicuously
eco-friendly products and artisanal vessels for one's snake oil, is
reliant on not living with a heterosexual male whose ancient toothbrush
looks as if it has received an electric shock and whose shaven whiskers
you'll spend hours picking out of your £26 bar of Vellutina from Santa
Maria Novella.

Do a web search for Quibi and the results suggest that the world doesn’t
really understand what’s happening. ‘WTF is Quibi?” goes one headline
while another states quite pompously that “I am a *Millennial*, I Don’t
Understand What Quibi is Trying to Do” while a third attempts to explain
what the video start-up is seeking to do.

Then there is a Wikipedia page[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quibi] that
proclaims that “Quibi is an upcoming American short-form mobile video
platform headquartered in Los Angeles, California, founded in 2018 by
Jeffrey Katzenberg and scheduled to launch on April 6, 2020.”
Information is sketchy, which is what makes Quibi an enigma wrapped in a
mystery.

NEW DELHI, Jan. 13 -- Actors get a chance to shoot in foreign locales,
but being in one city for almost two months is another feeling. Nakuul
Mehta can't stop talking about his 50-day shoot in London, UK, for a web
show. "It was wonderful to shoot in one of my favourite cities. After
seeing the city as a tourist, you see a different side to it while
working. We would hang out after shoot. I would visit parks on my days
off and check out the vibrant art, food and theatre scene," he says.

Given the fact that his hit TV shows Pyaar Ka Dard Hai and Ishqbaaaz
have been romantic dramas, Nakuul wanted to veer away from romance. But
this role in the romantic comedy was one he couldn't refuse. "The vibe
of the show is so *millennial*, something I have never done before. A
coming-of-age story of two friends who handle societal expectations was
interesting. It was quite relatable. Everything I've done is larger than
life and, in a good way, on steroids," he quips.

Since 2017, Banregio launched its Hey Banco platform, in the first
instance, to serve the *millennial* segment by offering you basic
financial products from the cell phone. Three years later, it makes the
relaunch of this application, but now more complete and aimed at a wider
circle that will include individuals with business activity.

"Hey Banco is a major bet by Banregio to drive the democratization of
financial services for the population who prefer to have a much faster,
more efficient transaction, and technology has come to meet this need,"
says Pedro Luis Ibarra, project leader.

Bhopal, Jan. 13 -- There is a worldwide demand of books on Indian
Culture, Art and History. Madhya Pradesh should take a lead in this area
because the state has a wide form of diversity in art and culture. The
diversity in culture and art is widely visible in the Chambal, Nimar,
Mahakaushal and Vindhya region. This was said by the Minister for Urban
Development and Housing Shri Jaivardhan Singh at the concluding
programme of the Heartland Stories, Bhopal Literature and Art Festival
at Bharat Bhavan. Shri Singh awarded the writers of various stories
written in the category of environment, science and relationships. He
also released several books on the occasion.

Ageing is the lifelong process of getting older, and the number of older
adults is increasing faster than ever. Ageing itself is not a disease,
yet Western society treats it as one. There's substantial evidence about
the many contributions older people make to our societies; however,
older adults are often stereotyped as dependent, frail or a burden, and
they are discriminated against on the grounds of age (‘ageism').

The Ministry of Social Development named 10 positive ageing indicators
in 2007. One of these indicators is ‘attitudes', where the desired
outcome is: "New Zealanders have positive attitudes towards ageing and
older people. Ageing is viewed as a positive experience by older people
themselves, and others value and respect older people and encourage
their contributions." So, it's time for a change in our attitudes,
preconceptions, assumptions and expectations about ageing. It's time for
millennials to start a countermovement.

When Karan Khairajani (30), the co-founder of Firescore Interactive, a
Mumbai-based game development studio, was hunting for ideas last
November, he hit a wall. "The games market is crowded and almost
everything has been done," he says, sitting at his sparsely decorated
basement office in Prabhadevi. The yearold studio, which he founded
along with Surojit Roy (31) in 2018, had churned out 20-odd
'hyper-casual games' — a genre of games that require minimal mechanics
and can be played with a single hand. This is when Khairajani turned to
the internet. His wife had introduced him to ASMR (autonomous sensory
meridian response) videos of people chopping soap bars into tiny cubes
with a knife. Apparently, people found the sight and sound of this
activity therapeutic. "Many found these videos to be relaxing.

The Great Indian Wedding gets its docket for being extravagant,
over-the-top and exhaustive. But, the moniker might soon be rendered
impractical for good. As young couples increasingly opt for waste-free
bungalows and minimalism over huge venues and opulence, weddings today
are getting intimate and niche. And with it, the food that we know and
queue up for at wedding counters are swiftly transforming too.As
weddings turn into intimate affairs, couples look to design tight, yet
funky menus that reflect their personality, says Bhakti Mehta, the owner
of Bombay-based catering service Little Food Co. “A lot of young couple
are looking to have their weddings at compact venues like a bungalow
with an outdoor setting. It is not restrictive of the kind of food we
do. Even if it’s familiar cuisine, the idea is to make it more authentic.

Las Vegas might seem like a strange place to any visitor – the bright
lights, the big fountains, hotels that look like Venice, Paris and
Disneyland – but it becomes even weirder when the Consumer Electronics
Show hits town in January. While flying cars and roll-up televisions
might grab the most attention, there are also plenty of oddball
inventions filling its three main venues. We walked the halls and
stalked some of the strangest (and some strangely useful) gadgets on
show. JENNIFER DUDLEY-NICHOLSON reports

Talking shower heads Talking shower heads US kitchen brand Kohler made a
name for themselves with a smart toilet invention. This year they turned
their attention to the humble shower head and launched Moxie, which not
only sprays water at you but features a built-in smart speaker and
access to voice assistants from the likes of Apple, Google and Amazon.
It might seem a little creepy, though at least it doesn’t feature a
camera and can help you play tunes in the shower.

MOBY-DICK

Heaven knows what Herman Melville would make of this world-premiere
musical adaptation by the team of Dave Malloy (music, lyrics, and book)
and director Rachel Chavkin (who developed the musical with Malloy.) But
at a minimum the novelist would have to acknowledge that Malloy and
Chavkin have devised an arrestingly expressive theatrical language to
tell his tale of tragic obsession. The duo — who previously collaborated
on another monumental 19th-century novel-turned-musical, “Natasha,
Pierre, & The Great Comet of 1812," based on a section of Leo Tolstoy's
“War and Peace" — take pains to directly connect “Moby-Dick" to the 21st
century, particularly in their “Hamilton"-like diverse casting. Through

Designers revel in textures and imperfections.

In the past decade we've seen family-friendly schemes with zippy chevron
patterns; Sputnik chandeliers over marble-topped Saarinen tables;
hygge-infused Nordic interiors draped in sheepskin; bohemian lairs
replete with macramé and rattan; moody black accent walls; Edison bulbs
amid faux industrial furnishings; gallery walls riddled with
inspirational quotes; *millennial* pink sofas paired with geometric rose
gold accents; living rooms sporting Beni Ourain rugs, mudcloth pillows,
and fiddle leaf ferns; white kitchens warmed up with floating wood
shelves; shiplap-covered walls with sliding barn doors; and navy blue
kitchens punctuated by brass fittings.

Evening emails and blurring of lines between home and office put parents
under strain

Evening emails and an “always on” working culture means that for many
parents their job has become too big for the hours they are supposed to
allot to it, according to an influential survey.

Consolidating the past to lasting memories

Towards the end of 2019 book-lovers witnessed the launch of significant
national reminiscent literary work by two veteran nationalists, Retired
Colonel Tshinga Dube and Ambassador Cain Mathema. Over the years,
Ambassador Mathema has extensively contributed to the body of knowledge
in the area of Zimbabwe's political-economy, social anthropology,
African cultural philosophy, liberation memory among other enthusing
faculties which are critical in reaffirming our national being.

BENGALURU, Jan. 12 -- A few years ago, Akanshi Srivastava was the only
woman in a Google Developers Group. Recently, she participated in a
hackathon in Bengaluru organized by Skillenza for Indonesian on-demand
services company Gojek. SheHack, as it was called, had only women.

It felt good to be surrounded by women hackers, she says, because
breaking stereotypes is what her generation loves to do. "I don't know
why this notion exists that girls don't know tech as well as guys do.
This has always bothered me," says Srivastava, who studied computer
science at Vellore Institute of Technology.

Inside Primrose Bagel Company, opening its doors in Toronto’s St. Clair
West neighbourhood on Jan. 10, there’s a large picture window with a
view directly into the kitchen. There, at almost any point in the day,
one of the bakery’s staff members laboriously rolls bagels by hand. It’s
a rare sight for a bagel shop – but that’s the point.

Primrose’s co-owners are Sam Davis and Jesse Rapoport, two young chefs
who’ve worked at some of Toronto’s top indie restaurants, and they are
determined to restore the largely forgotten tradition of hand-rolled bagels.

I love the royal family. It’s not based on any crusading ideological
bent of monarchism. I think it’s the history, and the hats and the
well-dressed children. This doesn’t stop me being a republican.

On paper I cannot deny the argument that we really do deserve to have
one of our own running the show.

Two months ago, on a business trip to Jaipur, I was put up at a fancy
hotel that was cut off from the main city. Though done in line with
international sense and sensibilities, it imposed a formal environment
and lacked the Rajasthani touch and warmth that I craved.

This time around I yearned for a different experience, one where I could
soak in the essence of Rajasthan from a glocal, central and *millennial*
friendly property but on a budget. Read on to find out how I maxed it out!

The United States remains the only industrialized country that does not
guarantee workers paid family leave. In 2018, just 17 percent of
civilian workers could get paid time off from work to care for a new
child or ill family member, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
That figure dips to 11 percent at the smallest companies. ¶ But a
tightening labor market and a vast cohort of *millennial* workers
beginning to start families are putting pressure on employers to expand
their benefits to attract and retain workers. Eight states, plus the
District of Columbia, have also passed laws that require workers or
their employer to pay into state paid leave funds through payroll
contributions. And President Trump has signed a bill that, for the first
time, will provide paid leave for the federal government’s estimated 2.1
million civilian employees following the birth, adoption or fostering of
a child.

Lounging at an outdoor cafe just outside downtown San Francisco, his
athletic frame filling out a slim-fit button-up, a talkative tech worker
named Daniel detailed the many ways he’s optimizing his existence.

Only the previous week, he says, he returned from a 10-day trip to
Italy’s Amalfi Coast. Before that, he boasts, he journeyed to a yoga
retreat and juice cleanse in Bali, the perfect setting to unload the
stress he absorbs working at a well-known tech company in Silicon
Valley. After ending a five-year marriage and shedding 10 pounds of
subcutaneous fat several years back — his sun-kissed body now carb- and
toxin-free — Daniel has reemerged a new, seemingly younger man.

Play the game. Don't focus on yourself alone. Look for challenges. But
don't focus on a specific result. Avoid hidden motives. Don't hold
anything. Be gentle and strong. Get involved and send the devil the idea
of winning. Don't overtest, don't calculate, but stay alert, watch for
signals. Be vulnerable. Show your eyes and invite others to look deeply;
make sure there's enough space and try to recognize everyone's image.
Don't make decisions you don't feel emotion about. Allow yourself to
fail. Above all, give yourself time and take the long way. Never ignore
what a tree or body of water has to tell you. Take root where the body
asks you to. Don't worry about your relatives, offer support to
strangers, bend over to look at insignificant things, immerse yourself
in deserted places, don't fall into the great drama of fate, laugh at
conflicts. Show your true colors until you prove you're right and the
whispering of the leaves becomes sweet. Walk through the villages."

The comedian who recently released her first stand-up special, ''The
Planet Is Burning,'' shares the things she can't live without.

Ilana Glazer's first stand-up special, now streaming on Amazon Prime,
has a provocatively unfunny title: ''The Planet Is Burning.'' But that
dark, deadpan phrase also captures something of the *millennial* ethos
that Glazer, 32, and her comedy partner Abbi Jacobson demonstrated in
their Comedy Central show ''Broad City'': In times of personal and
political chaos, just having fun can be an act of defiance. Calling from
her beloved Brooklyn home office, Glazer named ten things that she
cannot imagine life without -- for better and, in one instance, for
worse. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.

Mayors ponder the City Hall to White House leap.

For many decades of municipal history -- amid the ribbon cuttings and
council meetings and constituent complaints about trash pickup --
generations of small-city mayors have caught their reflection in a City
Hall bathroom mirror, taken stock of it all and concluded, consciously
or not: That person should probably not be the next president of the
United States.

Remember your grandmother's avocado-green kitchen? It could soon be
yours. Or maybe it'll be pink, mauve, emerald green or buttercup.
Anything but white, because the revolt against the white kitchen has begun.

Sweet treats are a weakness for many to eat at any time of the day to
accompany a rich coffee or tea.

The Day of the Pastry is celebrated on January 12. That's why Infobae
developed a tour with the best pastry houses in Buenos Aires to try the
sweet delicacies made by the best chef patissier in the country.

ASTUDY of Irish schoolchildren has revealed that fewer of them are
drinking, smoking, having sex or taking drugs and everyone over the age
of 25 spent last week scratching their ancient, irrelevant little heads
over it. The survey showed that while these behaviours that teenagers
have always been told will only end in tears have dropped, there has
also been a slight drop in lifesatisfaction and happiness, especially
among girls.

Any statistician will tell you: correlation is not causation. But I am
not a statistician, and to me it seems clear that 15-yearold girls are
happier when getting inexpertly groped by 15-year-boys in the bushes,
surrounded by empty naggins and chip wrappers. Teenage drinking, smoking
and shagging is one of the only shared life-experiences that
millennials, Gen X and boomers are all willing to admit to, even to
glorify. Having a boy's grubby hands under your clothes while trying not
to choke on a cigarette made us who we are today.

THEATRE Trad Staged by Livin' Dred Theatre Company, this selfconsciously
bleak musical comedy by Mark Doherty (David O'Doherty's brother) delves
into the relationship between a 100-year-old man and his grotesque
father. Doherty never dreamt his play — which premiered at the 2004
Galway Arts Festival — would be staged outside Ireland, but its surreal
narrative has universal appeal, as productions in Adelaide, London and
Edinburgh have demonstrated. Directed by Aaron Monaghan, this new
touring version stars Seamus O'Rourke.

Neil Delamere's

End of Watch show was a hit at last year's Edinburgh Festival Fringe,
but what will Irish audiences make of the routine? The Edinburgh version
began with some lively audience participation, after which the Edenderry
comic riffed on his elderly father's birthday and his *millennial*
niece's attempts to drive.

More and more young people are betting on having few things in their
property and instead paying for what is used for a while, something that
is done with music and movies (which are already enjoyed in streaming
and not in physical format) and also with vehicles (in the big cities
there are mu clicks car and motorbike rental brands per minute). Now,
this trend also reaches the clothes that can be worn on a daily basis:
for a few months now, several companies offer to rent clothes for the
day to day, an initiative that emerged a decade ago in the USA that is
used mainly by women and that favors the circular economy and reduce
waste caused by the fashion industry. "We are like a Netflix closet",
sums up María José González, of Pislow, one of the companies that offers
this service.

Las Vegas might seem like a strange place to any visitor — the bright
lights, the big fountains, hotels that look like Venice, Paris and
Disneyland — but it becomes even weirder when the Consumer Electronics
Show hits town in January.

While flying cars and roll-up televisions might grab the most attention,
there are also plenty of oddball inventions filling its three main venues.

A "mooncalf" is defined variously as an abortive or monstrous birth, a
fool or dullard, or a minor creature mentioned in the Harry Potter books.

Like its title, Toronto debut novelist Victoria Hetherington's new work
Mooncalves is subject to many ambiguous and resonating interpretations.

I always get the question from visiting relatives: "If I had a chance to
only eat at one Filipino restaurant, Margaux, where should I go?"

Formal is boring and cannot be stylish” is a sort of a misconception
now. Workwear has evolved from ‘one style suits all’ to become more
flexible and supple so as to cover personal choices. Bold coloured
dresses, a chic black blazer paired with classy cowl-neck top, pencil
skirt or high-waist trousers now fit well in what is termed as the
‘business casuals’ wardrobe.

Steadily, a trend is gaining popularity among a band of professionals
who like to breathe a refreshing tinge of fashion into serious business
dressing. The trend imbues job-friendly attire to suit the brand’s
image. While some sectors certainly exude authority like bank managers,
lawyers, politicians, and for them power dressing is imperative. Wearing
clothes that are the right-fit, comfortable and do not restrict movement
is important.

Visakhapatnam: As officials gear up to conduct civic polls in the city
after a gap of seven years, the *millennial* voters, who would be voting
in a civic election for the first time, are taking their democratic
rights seriously and focusing on issues that would be the determining
factors in the polls.“I want a neat, clean and pollution-free
environment. Often I have seen garbage pile up in my neighbourhood. I
want the civic body to focus on state-of-the art waste disposal
management and keep my locality neat and clean,” 22-year-old M Pushpa,
who stays in Madhurawada area of the city, says.Pushpa, who got her name
registered in the electoral rolls just before the 2019 general
elections, cast her vote for the first time on April 11 last year, when
simultaneous polls were held for the Lok Sabha and AP assembly.

It’s raining royal memes in Britain, not confetti. Blimey, what’s going
on? The Firm is in a bloody mess, that’s what, old chap. Are the natives
restless or not? It looks like the sun has finally set on the Windsor
empire.Bechari Queen Elizabeth! She had just about managed to keep her
Royal Ascot hat from toppling off her coiffured head after Prince Andrew
was accused of raping an underage girl in the ongoing and very messy
Jeffrey Epstein sex scandal, when the Megxit bombshell exploded and
shook the foundation of Buckingham Palace yet again.This is the Brit
version of our very own saas-bahu saga, folks. The thing is, Prince
Harry wants out. As in, he is done being a royal. The carefully worded
notice to quit his job was euphemistically described as “stepping back”.
In real terms, Harry and his feisty missus have told the Queen to eff
off. And loyal British subjects (They exist! They exist!) have promptly
pounced on the bahu — Harry’s attractive American wife of mixed parentage.

We live in disruptive times. As technology is changing the way most
businesses function, they have to deal with blistering change. This
year's theme of the seventh edition of the annual conclave, Business
Today MindRush, 'Disrupt or Die', was apt for such times. India's
leading businessmen graced the event at the Taj Lands End Hotel in
Mumbai on December 13 where 15 captains of industry were felicitated
with Best CEO Awards for excellence in their fields.

Dharmendra Pradhan, Union Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas and
Steel, delivered the keynote address and handed over India's Best CEO
awards to the winners. "Indian industry is going through disruptions,
but that does not mean that you will die if you don't disrupt," he said,
adding that data is the new oil and the government is formulating a new
data policy. He added that India is progressing in the right direction
and the country will become a developed nation in the coming years
despite hiccups.

So you've decided to join a gym. Congratulations that was the easiest
part of the process. Which gym to join is a much harder decision to make
and one with varying degrees of financial pain.

I recently moved to London, and have been looking for both a permanent
job and a home. A regular gym goer, I didn't want to commit to a
traditional membership as I didn't know where I would be living or
working. Finding out about the alternatives opened my eyes to how young,
city dwelling gym goers can crunch the costs of a workout.

t boring and forgotten segment of women's fashion," says Toby
Darbyshire, cofounder and chief executive of five-year-old hosiery and

underwear technology, however, it is clear he doesn't believe this for a
moment.

As had been the case early in the year, the top three local portals in
Mexico in November 2019 were Medio Tiempo, SDP Noticias and UNO TV in
ascending order, according to the Comscore Ranking de Medios Nativos
Digitales. Third-placed Medio Tiempo upped its own audience by 10% to
draw closer to the top two though with SDP Noticias also closing the gap
on UNO TV. Outside the leading places, Naranxadul - aimed at
*Millennial* mothers - enjoyed the biggest increase in the month of
November, one of 900%, to move up from number 36 to number 30. Cocina
Delirante has gone from number sixteen to number ten; Ok Chicas, from 22
to 17; Soy Carmin, from 10 to 7; and Cultura Colectiva, from 6 to 4.
Going in the other direction was Sopitas, falling from 8 to 11 with a
24% dip in its site-visitors

In the final column of last year, we anticipated the "coming of a
dangerous decade", fraught with geopolitical tensions, among a number of
other existential challenges. In response, the former Commanding Officer
of the Special Air Service Regiment, Ben Pronk, wrote: "It wouldn't take
anything more than a Franz Ferdinand-style miscalculation to kick [the
next global war off]."

Pronk, who is now chief executive of Mettle Global, a crisis consulting
firm, penned these words 24 hours before President Donald Trump
liquidated the second-most-senior member of Iran's government, Qassem
Soleimani, triggering a potentially catastrophic chain of events.

India, Jan. 11 -- Home Minister Amit Shah described Prime Minister
Narendra Modi as a "karmayoddha" while releasing a book, Karmayoddha
Granth, on the life of the PM. According to Shah, a karmayoddha is a man
"with a beating heart for people, a statesman, a hard task master, an
able administrator and an ideal leader who leads by example". Shah said
the PM has "transformed into a global leader without accreting anything
for himself.Modi is the epitome of selfless service to the nation".

The subtext this week at CES was whether the gonzo tech event is even
relevant anymore.

Over the years, major tech brands have increasingly taken their most
important events and announcements off-site — either in different
locations across the Las Vegas Strip or in completely separate,
dedicated events.

In a western world progressively polarized by ideology rooted in
identity, race and religion, five up-and-coming thinkers are offering
perspectives that go beyond the monotonous truisms of the political left
and right.

These British, American and Canadian intellectuals, from a range of
backgrounds, volunteer refreshingly unpredictable ideas. Whether
linguists or novelists, they're authors gaining wide traction through
outlets from The Guardian and The New Yorker to Real Time with Bill
Maher and Comedy Central.

In recent years I've eaten at many mouth-watering food markets in the
United States that offer high-end gourmet fast food at very affordable
prices.

Each time I've asked myself the same question: when is this trend coming
to Montreal? Well, fellow nibblers and noshers it's here! Both Time-Out
Market in the Eaton Centre and Le Central on Ste-Catherine St. are now
feeding sensational fast food to thousands.

José Angel Gurría Treviño, Secretary General of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), stated that the Treaty
between Mexico, the United States and Canada (T-MEC) "is not going to
bring us out of the poor, but it has potential."

"While the Mexican economy will be strengthened by ratification and
eventual entry into force of the treaty, it will not solve Mexico's
problems. It would be welcome growth, but definitely not enough," said
Mexico's former Secretary of Finance on his last day of work around the
country.

The past projects not just catapulted Ananya to stardom but it also
showcased praiseworthy performance from the teen. Her cinematic appeal
is unmissable. Talking about how enthralled she is on her journey of
2020 and her upcoming projects, Ananya exudes "It's going to be super
hard to top off 2019. I'm excited about Khaali Peeli, it's in a
different zone - with a bit of thrill, drama, comedy. It's insane that
in just one year, I have three films releasing (since my debut in 2019).
I'm lucky to be in this position.

sneakers, lamps from Philippe Starck.

And on the walls, art: invertedcolour lunarscapes by Wang Yuyang,
sensual photo-realist images by Marilyn Minter, complex abstractions of
modern life by Zhang Changjiang, detailed floral designs by You Wendi, a
reflection on time and movement through table tennis by Wang Jianwei.

going later can make sense from several perspectives

Last November, when my now-husband and I got married, we registered for
contributions to our honeymoon. "Where are you going?" everyone wanted
to know. We didn't have an answer. Between all the time, money and
energy that went into the ceremony and reception, travel plans were on
the back burner. And we're not alone. Once again, the definition of a
"honeymoon" seems to be changing.

The word "honeymoon" dates to the fifth century, when wedded couples
would drink mead (sweet wine) during the first month, or moon, of
marriage. In Victorian England, it meant visiting family and friends who
couldn't attend the wedding. Only later would the meaning evolve into a
romantic holiday for two.
