Vietnam`s millennials tend to be more health- and beauty-conscious than
earlier generations, and willing to pay a premium for quality.

The cosmetic market in Vietnam has quickly developed thanks to the fast
growth of millennial shoppers who are more aware of health and beauty
services.

Although the housing market has cooled a little in many cities, there’s
still a sense among young adults that they may never own a house. And
so, they ask questions like this one:

Q: “I’m in my early-30s, and am only now starting to think about
(possible) home ownership. How common is it for first-time homeowners to
completely drain their savings to make a good down payment? At this
point in time, that’s what I’m facing, and I’m not sure how ‘normal’ or
financially responsible that would be.”

Anyone can become rich if they know the right steps to take.

But if you possess a certain set of characteristics, you may be more
likely to become wealthy, according to Sarah Stanley Fallaw, director of
research for the Affluent Market Institute. She co-authored The Next
Millionaire Next Door: Enduring Strategies for Building Wealth, in which
she surveyed more than 600 millionaires in America.

The year 2018 saw a record number of young investors flock to the
stockmarket, according to trading platform nabtrade, as housing remained
relatively unaffordable to many young people and market accessibility
continued to improve.

The number of Generation Z investors, those born after 1995, shot up 73
per cent last year, according to nabtrade data.

The latest Market Talks covering Equities. Published exclusively on Dow
Jones Newswires throughout the day.

[Dow Jones] Despite the absence of official commentary since November,
the RBNZ policy debate for 2019 has already started with a bang. The
market is pricing a roughly 50% price of a rate cut by the year-end,
while 2-year swap rates are hitting all-time lows. JPMorgan says the
absence of meaningful fiscal support, alongside risks to higher mortgage
rates from the RBNZ's new bank capital rules, will keep the central bank
dovish this year. Still, it would be fairly controversial for a central
bank to cut rates with unemployment at a decade low, and inflation near
target. The RBNZ is typically quite sensitive to global developments,
and Gov. Orr will likely show heightened sensitivity to any weakening in
the activity data. Still, JPMorgan at this stage expects the official
cash rate to remain steady. (james.glynn@wsj.com; @JamesGlynnWSJ)

Median home sale prices in Seattle and elsewhere in King County are
falling along with buyer demand, but market fundamentals remain strong,
according to Zillow Director of Economic Research and Outreach Skylar Olsen.

In a lively presentation at the Business Journal's Outlook 2019 event,
Olsen said the slowdown is not due to a weakening economy or uncertainty
over interest rates; rather, it's due to "affordability exhaustion." She
said market fundamentals remain strong because job growth hasn't slowed yet.

He has a bad-boy rock-star vibe...

Don’t let that charming smile fool you. The 29-year-old looker, who
forayed into films seven years ago but has shot into the spotlight in
the last few years, is an alpha-male, both on screen and off it. A sex
symbol, Vijay Deverakonda is the hottest (and coolest) star on the
block, exuding a raw masculinity that’s hard to ignore. We love many
things about him, most of all his rock star walk and talk.

THE proverbial has really hit the fan in the UK. Brexit has split the
country in a way hitherto thought to be impossible.

It has divided a nation and, as has become almost de riguer in First
World countries, the government of the day and the opposition parties
have no idea what to do next.

Someone I know in the financial services industry marvels at how many
indebted people have cash sitting in savings accounts paying next to
nothing in interest. To him, it’s a no-brainer to tap into savings
earning 1 or 2 per cent at best to repay debts that might range from 4.5
to 5 per cent for a home equity line of credit to 20 per cent for a
credit card.

I have lived in Ottawa with my family for more than 20 years, but I grew
up in Toronto. I rented a few apartments in the city in the later 1980s,
and my wife and I bought our first home there in 1992. Unlike today, the
cost of housing wasn’t a huge problem back then.

Housing affordability in Toronto, Vancouver and some surrounding areas
is a personal-finance emergency. Young people are spending too much of
their pay on rent or mortgage payments, or they’re living with parents
or roommates. Some are fleeing.

The target audience Predictably, as a 28-year-old woman, I became a
zealot of the cult of Cat Person; in the parlance of the *Gen Y*
feminist, "it spoke to me."

The rest of You Know You Want This did not. The collection is grotesque
but the macabre lacks any meaning. In fact, many of the stories — about
a disturbed children's party, say, or the fable about a queen who falls
in love with a bone (?) — failed to say much at all. The collection
didn't send a chill up my spine so much as make me want to toss the book
across the room; after three stories on the trot I reverted to an
episode of The OC to calm down.

It was the short story that captured the mood of #MeToo and became a
viral sensation, now Kristen Roupenian’s first book is on the way. Does
it live up to the hype, asks Katie Law

If youlive or work in any of the hipper parts of south London, prepare
to be assaulted next month by the sight of bright shiny foil-covered
billboards declaring “You Know You Want This” in huge letters. They’re
just a small part of one of the biggest publicity campaigns ever mounted
for a book of short stories — Kristen Roupenian’s debut collection of
the same name.

*HD* 	Our kids got RESP money for Christmas. How should we invest it?
The most sensible thing to do is invest the $4,000 that you have sitting
in cash as soon as possible

Question e-mailed in from Globe reader: We have a family RESP in an
online brokerage account for our sons, aged 8 and 10. For Christmas,
their awesome grandparents have given each of the kids $1,000. That,
combined with our contributions, means we have $4,000 in cash sitting
there now. We have topped it out each year, putting in $2,500 per kid,
and invested the money over time in a number of index-tracking ETFs. We
have seen gains of around 18 per cent since we opened the RESP. But we
are nervous about stock markets going forward. Everything feels
uncertain, stocks seem due for a pullback. Should we pull our older
son’s money out of equities and put them into something safer such as
GICs? Or should we invest again, and if so, what would you recommend?

Answer from Benjamin Felix, an associate portfolio manager with PWL
Capital[https://www.pwlcapital.com/en/Advisor/Ottawa/Cameron-Passmore/Testimonials]
in Ottawa.

It is crucial to identify and hire the people who will not just drive
your mission but will also be instrumental in taking it to the next level.

Every startup stands on two pillars that are the very premise of its
existence - disruption and talent. Disruption not only in the sector
they operate in but also in how they conduct their operations, of which
hiring and managing talent is the most important aspect. Talent, or
people, are the most important assets in any organisation - more so, for
start-ups.

Dynamic changes are in store for retailers and brands this year with
macroeconomic forces creating challenges as well as pockets of
opportunities — at least for trend-right brands, according to the latest
trend report from Jane Hali & Associates LLC.

Jane Hali, chief executive officer of her namesake firm, said the
larger, macro forces at play include the possibility of more interest
rate hikes, “moderating” housing market fundamentals and acceleration of
inventory receipts — not ideal for the post-holiday shopping season
period. Hali also said pureplay e-commerce retailing remains a threat to
traditional retailers as does the addition of pop-ups and new store
concepts that can heat up the competitive landscape.

In its latest Feed4Thought survey, Cargill found that twice as many
young respondents, ages 18 – 34, in the U.S. and China reported knowing
a livestock or seafood farmer compared to those older than 55—with
similar trends in Mexico and France. And while 81% of 18-to-34-year-old
Chinese participants said they have visited a livestock or seafood farm
during their lifetime, only 50% of older survey respondents had. Young
respondents in every country surveyed were more likely to have visited a
farm than those over 55, despite the fact that, globally, there are
fewer farmers to know or visit today than there were a generation ago.

Features | CBD, one of the substances found in marijuana, has been
lauded as the latest hipster must-have and it is making for a huge and
fast-growing industry. Oliver Bennett reports

On a trip to November’s MJBiz Conference, the world’s biggest cannabis
convention that is held annually in Las Vegas, UK entrepreneur Johan
Obel was surprised to be stopped at the airport – after all, cannabis
has been legal in Nevada since 2017.

Along with several *Gen-Y* stars, Karan Johar's Dharma Productions has
launched a number of new directors, too. The latest one to be added to
the list is Bhanu Pratap Singh. The filmmaker has been working on a
horror comedy for quite some time now and has locked Vicky Kaushal for
the same. A source says, "The film is funny yet scary. It's an
interesting mix and when Vicky was approached for it, he instantly took
an interest. Bhanu developed the characters and the actor has already
started shooting for the movie." As for its leading lady, the informer
reveals, "The makers have got Bhumi Pednekar on board. It's a small but
impactful role. When they were scouting for a face from the younger
generation, they thought of Bhumi as she fit the character." The
actress, too, has begun filming her portions. "She has a few days of
work on the movie, before she begins her next -- Womaniya," adds the source.

Nearly a week into the new year, people are still sticking to their New
Year's resolutions, including the perennial favorite: lose weight.

Without ever setting foot in a diet center, today's health-conscious
consumers can sift through a full menu of support and strategy options
with the flick of a thumb. The online choices abound – the promise of a
challenge on apps like DietBet.com and MyFitnessPal, celebs to emulate
on Twitter, detox teas and other products peddled on Instagram and
Facebook, YouTube fitness moguls with how-to videos, and the camaraderie
in closed WhatsApp groups.

Consumer trust in autonomous vehicles (AVs) appears to be stalling. In
the U.S., 50 percent of survey respondents do not believe AVs will be
safe, nearly the same as last year's 47 percent. That is drastically
different from consumer sentiment in 2017, when 74 percent voiced
concerns about these vehicles' safety. Other markets saw similar
plateauing, with the share of consumers in China, Japan and South Korea
who believe AVs will not be safe decreasing modestly; and Indian and
German consumers both showing slight increases in their distrust.

New research from Viacom’s Global Consumer Insights unit shows that a
heavy majority of viewers ages 12-34 prefer watching programming with
onscreen channel logos, as opposed to programming on plain, logo-free
screens.

The findings counter the widespread assumption that streaming services
such as Netflix, Amazon and Hulu are eroding traditional TV brands, with
millennials and *Gen Y* viewers eager to disregard the channel identity
as they seek out what to watch. Many stakeholders in TV also have
predicted a future in which the brands of individual shows are superior
to the 20th century concept of a network brand filter.

Happy 2019, Globe Money readers.

As we embark on a new year that could bring further interest-rate hikes
and more volatility in financial markets, Canadians with high levels of
household, credit-card or mortgage debt should be feeling concerned.
Those with savings might be wondering where to invest their money, while
recent grads could be fretting about how to secure a good job and get
into the expensive housing market. Retirees might need reassurance that
they have enough money saved for all of their needs.

The B-schools of tomorrow may need to define Connect
2.0…real-time…sustained connect. As the students who are groomed on
business acumen at a B-school step into the corporate world, is there a
way to sustain the connect beyond alumni connects?

As we all know, business schools have played a pivotal role in defining
the corporate world as we know it today. Hence, it will be interesting
to share my thoughts on how they can continue to play that role as the
world evolves to a new reality.

Recalling Shakespeare's "All the world's a stage, and all the men and
women merely players; they have their exits and their entrances, and one
man in his time plays many parts.."

Ask an artist & a connoisseur about their great fear & the greatest
love. Their answer respectively would be acting & watching a "Live
performance on stage". If there existed one medium that nourishes your
conscience, titillates your senses, warms your cockles & serves your
soul, it must be by way of an expression of honesty, exclusive to
theatre alone. People like Girish Karnad, Mahesh Dattani, Rahul da
Cunha, Dolly Thakore, Lilette Dubey, Naseeruddin Shah, Makarand
Deshpande, Quasar Thakore Padamsee tell you a tale of how theatre can be
liberating, educating, inspirational, reinvigorating & accomplishing too.

Nazia Erum, Mothering a Muslim

Erum’s well-researched book takes the conversation of religious
segregation and communal hatred inside the least expected space of urban
middle class India—the classroom. She talks to over a hundred children
and their parents across twelve cities in many of the country’s top
schools, uncovering stories of systemic bullying of Muslim children and
age-old prejudices. Mothering a Muslim is a disturbing cultural study of
deep-seated Islamophobia existing within the walls of seemingly
progressive institutions meant to impart impartial education to young
minds. This book is an urgent, engrossing read which needs to be read
and discussed widely.
