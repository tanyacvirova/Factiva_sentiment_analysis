Who is America's leader of the opposition? There is no such position, of
course, within the American system of government. But alongside Democrat
congressional leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, a new figure has
emerged as a counterweight to President Donald Trump.

Her name is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, also known to her followers as
"AOC". A newly elected congresswoman from New York City, Ocasio-Cortez
came to attention last year. Then 28 years old, having worked as a
bartender only months earlier, she upset a prominent Democrat to win the
party's nomination for a seat in the House of Representatives.
Describing herself as a democratic socialist, she has rapidly built a
following as the de facto leader of the Justice Democrats group.

*HD* 	Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Is the Perfect Ideological Complement to
President Trump; The new congresswoman may be one of the most important
political figures of our age

A week into the new Congress, there's a gathering consensus among the
commentator class that the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez bubble is already
bursting. Her inexperience, knowledge gaps and alarmingly ahistorical
belief in impossible ideologies are unflatteringly visible, it is said,
under the glare of the very media exposure she has brilliantly
attracted. When luminous figures in your own party like Whoopi Goldberg
tell you on national TV that you need to stop "pooping" on older and
wiser Democrats, you might think it's time to sit out the next dance.

I am not so sure. Indeed, the more I see of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez (I refuse
to do the AOC thing, which I thought was a designation used in French
wine labeling), the more I think she is building a claim to be one of
the most important political figures of our age.

Twinkies are a type of confectionary made of sponge cake with cream
filling. The vanilla filling will account for major shares in the twinky
cakes market owing to the popularity of vanilla-flavored twinkies among
young consumers in the age group of 13-18 years and *millennial*
customers. To cater to the growing popularity, vanilla is the most
common filling used in twinkies.

The future’s looking grim for petrolheads, drive-thrus, country pubs,
muddy boots and your handy pack of wine gums

It’s been a bad week for people who like driving. Self-driving cars, we
were told, are not the future, they are the present. They are on the
roads already. I’m not certain exactly which roads, but definitely not
mine. Every morning I load my kids into the Fiesta, flop into the
driving seat and say, very clearly, “take us to school”, but the car
does nothing. So I say it again, in my special
speaking-to-artificial-intelligence voice: “taaaake — us — toooo —
skoooool.” And then I bark, “TAKE US TO ****ING SCHOOL!” But it just
sits there. Like the heap of stupid iron it has been since I bought it
17 years ago.

Diversifying craft beer isn’t just a good idea – it’s good business.

“There’s an economic imperative here,” said J. Nikol Jackson-Beckham,

there’s just not.”

Medicine Week -- A new study on Radiology is now available. According to
news reporting out of Singapore, Singapore, by NewsRx editors, research
stated, "Radiology is a unique medical specialty that focuses on image
interpretation and report generation with limited patient contact."

Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Singapore
General Hospital, "Resident read-out sessions with teaching are a
quintessential part of reporting workflow practices in teaching
institutions. However, most radiologist-educators do not have formal
training in teaching and learning experiences vary."

means for moving from qualitative to (semi-)quantitative evaluations of
material (e.g., water, sediment and nutrients) transfer across the
building blocks of a terrestrial system. In geomorphology, compared to
closely related disciplines like ecology and hydrology, the development
of indices has only recently started and as such presents opportunities
and challenges that merit attention."

Uber, Lyft and other companies expected to go public in 2019 face timing
challenges, including racing to debut before a potential recession and
likely delays caused by the U.S. government shutdown. “Uber and Lyft
lead a handful of Silicon Valley multibillion-dollar companies founded
during the last recession that may go public in 2019,” reports CNBC.
“But with many economists forecasting a recession by 2020, it seems
these rideshare companies, as well as other IPO candidates, such as
Airbnb, Slack and Palantir, may be racing against a recession clock for
deals that in all could reach more than $200 billion in valuation.
History shows the IPO market does suffer when stocks and the broader
economy tank, but big names like Uber and Lyft can likely get deals done
in any market. They just may have to swallow lower deal pricing than
they want.” They may also have to wait a bit. The U.S.

New Delhi, Jan. 11 -- The society of the Keepers of the Quaich was
established in the Scottish Highlands in 1980s to recognize people's
work in the production and promotion of Scotch whisky globally. Over the
years, more than 2,500 people from over 100 countries have become its
members. In December, the Keepers of the Quaich launched their India
chapter, their eighth international chapter, in Udaipur. James
Pennefather, 44, the managing director of William Grant & Sons India,
was appointed chairman of the India chapter. In an interview after the
launch, Pennefather spoke about the society's hopes in India, Indian
single malts, global trends in the spirits business and the threats to
the whisky industry. Edited excerpts:

How does Keepers of the Quaich work? How do you choose the members in
any new geography? India has always been a huge market so why set up an
India chapter now?

New Delhi, Jan. 11 -- We just don't get the big picture. The more I talk
to people about money, the clearer it is that we compartmentalize our
money lives so tightly that we totally fail to see the big picture.
Every conversation with whoever I meet now swings around to money.
People share their stories, their worries and their fears. They share
the power equation within home that money causes. While housewives have
always shared stories of the skewed power money equation, working women
have equally scary stories. That's because those who earn more than men
have a triple burden-to manage work, home and the male ego. But most
often the usual story is the fuzziness about how we think about money
and how we simply are not able to see the whole money story. A typical
conversation goes like this: I'm managing to save-it's is a small
amount, but I've started a recurring deposit in a bank. But didn't you
say you have a credit card EMI that you are paying? That's right.

PVH Corp. (PVH) shares are up 7.3% in Friday trading after the fashion
company announced earnings guidance for the fourth quarter and detailed
a restructuring of the Calvin Klein brand. PVH's portfolio also includes
Tommy Hilfiger and Speedo. PVH expects fourth-quarter adjusted earnings
per share of "at least" $1.75, ahead of the $1.70 FactSet consensus.
Full-year 2018 EPS is expected to be "at least" $9.50, also ahead of the
$9.45 FactSet guidance. PVH will shutter the Calvin Klein flagship in
New York City, relaunch the CALVIN KLEIN 205W39NYC business, focus on
digital, and streamline the jeans and sportswear business. UBS analysts
say the announcement signals "three bullish points": the Calvin Klein
brand isn't getting weaker, concerns that China and Europe would hurt
PVH aren't coming to pass, and the Calvin Klein denim business isn't a
drag on earnings. UBS rates PVH stock buy with a price target of $145.

There was a time not so long ago when Austin was mostly regarded as a
sleepy college town with an abiding appreciation for high-quality
barbecue and live music.

Though it hasn't lost its appreciation for juicy brisket, the formerly
laid-back state capital — now overrun with *millennial* transplants and
start-ups — has become something else, as well: one of the nation's
preeminent micro-mobility testing grounds.

New Delhi, Jan. 11 -- A few years ago, actor, RJ and impresario Roshan
Abbas noticed that many of his friends-including independent musician
Ankur Tewari and actor Gaurav Kapur-were feeling disillusioned with the
professional grind and looking to try something new and exciting to
rekindle their creative passion. An inveterate problem-solver, Abbas
gathered his friends at a bungalow in Versova, Mumbai, in 2015 to start
Kommune, an artists' collective that uses digital tools to help create
and promote original performance art with a special focus on
storytelling. A little over three years later, the organization has
helped put Indian storytelling and spoken word on the global map with
its festival Spoken, which returns to Mumbai's Jio Garden for its second
edition on 12 and 13 January. Acts in the line-up include American
rapper Akua Naru, American spoken word poet Blythe Baird, Kashmiri Sufi
rock band Alif and American performance artist Alok Vaid-Menon.

There are times when National Geographic Channel's "Valley of the Boom"
(9-11 p.m. Sunday and Jan. 20 and 27) works exceptionally well. In these
gonzo moments - when characters break the fourth wall and address
viewers directly or a puppet version of Bill Gates restates something
Mr. Gates actually said in a public setting - "Valley of the Boom"
benefits from the willingness of writer Matthew Carnahan ("House of
Lies") to deviate from form.

In the first hour, actor John Karna, playing slightly off Netscape
programmer Marc Andreessen, announces to viewers he's an actor and his
dialogue is based on words the real Mr. Andreessen "actually said or is
likely enough to have said so he won't sue us."

Lindsay Shepherd, 24, has been accused of many unseemly things in the
past year.

But a sit-down with the former Sir Wilfrid Laurier University teaching
assistant, who was thrust into the news in late 2017 when she exposed
the way her Ontario professors accused her of creating a "toxic
environment" in her class after raising the issue of gender pronouns,
quickly reveals there is no substance to the demonized portrait.

function. Sure, I spent at least one ill-advised winter in my teens
refusing to wear winter boots (frostbite is a cool way to rebel!),
barely avoiding hypothermia while subjecting those around me to my
perpetually salt-encrusted boot-cut jean hems, but for the most part,
I've always searched for the warmest and most water-repellent coat and
boots my budget would allow.

Imagine how my world opened up when I moved to Toronto four years ago
and discovered that the Big Smoke is typically at least 5 C warmer than
La Belle Ville and gets infinitely less snow. Fashion and function could
coexist - who knew?

THIS terrific debut is intensely *millennial*. Each character is deeply

“Ghosting” – the practice of ignoring a potential partner after speaking
to or going on a date with them – was one of 2018's biggest buzzwords,
and thought to be a trend confined to the world of dating.

But, much to the horror of companies around the world, it is becoming
increasingly common in the workplace. Employees are simply leaving and
never coming back, with no formal resignation or explanation given.

The communes of Santiago, Providencia and Independencia are the most
attractive for millennials to live, according to a report by AGS Visión
Inmobiliaria. Closeness to work places, mobility, greater supply of
equipment and environment, are the reasons for this trend.

The investigation made a cross between the information of the 2017
Census, statistics of real estate offer in the Greater Santiago
-considering values of lease and typology, among others- and an analysis
of connectivity (time and distance) to different poles of equipment,
services and offices .

“LRT is different than other operators. We view that other operators of

as employing human resources from the hospitality sector,” said Allan in

Ready-to-eat food was an unfathomable concept in our country a few
generations ago. When this category arrived in India in the 1960s, it
did not evoke a hugely positive response. Perhaps it was a product
innovation much ahead of its time. We Indians never considered any other
fare besides fresh, traditionally cooked food. The era of convenience
food began when the government research agency CFTRI developed the
technology to preserve food without preservatives in a dehydrated form
for commercial usage.

THE pioneering pilot, author, designer, and feminist Amelia Earhart was
officially declared dead 80 years ago on January 5, 1939. Her plane
supposedly disappeared in the Pacific Ocean. Yet to this day, no one can
say for sure when Earhart really died.

Despite decades of speculation, investigations, and analysis, aviation
historians and anthropologists are still trying to piece the puzzle of
her disappearance and death together. They know Earhart was flying a
plane across the Pacific—the first female pilot to attempt such a
flight. On July 2, 1937, she disappeared, along with her navigator Fred
Noonan, during the 2,227 nautical mile trip from Lae, New Guinea to
Howland Island.

It’s the season of wedding bells and celebrations across the country,
with several highprofile nuptials of Bollywood A-listers and
industrialists taking place all over the world. High up on that coveted
list was the wedding of Naivedya Agarwal, son of Vedanta chairman Navin
Agarwal, with Ananya Kejriwal on December 18 in Mumbai. Naivedya is the
co-founder of Runaya MetSource, while Ananya, a Harvard graduate, is a
successful entrepreneur. Traditions blended seamlessly with modernity
for this couple as a select group of 40 blessed the newly-weds in
Varanasi, which was followed by an all-youngsters bash in Beirut — a
true reflection of the strong values that define the Agarwal family and
Vedanta Group. Keeping with traditions, the wedding saw a series of
rituals taking place that blended with the new-age *millennial* outlook.

Ease, comfort, and pleasure are what millennials, those members of the
high-anxiety “Doom Generation,” really want — and capitalism is into it.
A new beverage called Recess is a case study in where those desires
meet. Bubbles? Yes. CBD? Check. Sans-serif block font? Yeah! A knowing,
nudging, creepily on-point Instagram presence? Obviously.

You have to laugh at French author Yann Moix. If you hadn't heard, he's
the author who sparked a firestorm after publicly declaring that women
over 50 were "too, too old" to love.

Apparently, the 50-year-old argues, while the body of a 25-year-old
woman is "extraordinary", the fleshy folds of a fellow 50-year-old "are
not extraordinary at all". Women of a certain age, the cavorting
croissant-wielding Casanova declared, are "invisible" to him. Prompting
women around the world to sigh, if only women under 50 could be
invisible to you too . . .

Are you results-driven, "unparalleled in the 'being organised'
category", and a great note-taker who never takes anything personally?
Would you like the "opportunity to look inside the mind of a successful,
fast-paced, intense, sometimes chaotic . . . 28-year-old entrepreneur"?

So went a viral Seek job ad, posted earlier this month, ostensibly by a
Melbourne-based CEO. The ad laid down expectations that the successful
candidate manage all the daily business and personal activities of the
CEO, would be involved with all manner of tasks including both business
negotiations and cleaning, would be available after hours, and could
"lead from behind" - all for a $50k salary.

There's a spicy act currently touring Australia. It's not a music
festival with an international line-up, but a pop-up of monstera, peace
lillies and hanging ferns. It's an indoor plant sale.

In 2017, Melbourne-based The Jungle Collective launched a plant sale
worlds away from your local nursery's. Their roving plant parties
involve a DJ, "designer pots", a secret location, costume themes and
most importantly, hype. It continues its wisteria-like creep through
social media and registrations are capped.

ST. LOUIS, Jan. 10 -- Madrinas Coffee has won significant traction in
building audience & converting sales of its Cold Brew Coffee to a
sizable and growing digital audience. While direct-to-consumer online
sales remain strong for the brand, feedback from their digital audience
indicated more retail availability was needed across California,
Florida, and Texas in order to properly serve them. The expansion into
Walmart stores is the brand's response to this feedback from their audience.

A relatively new venture capital firm is getting more attention.

Dallas-based TXV Partners, which has an Austin office, is in the midst
of raising $50 million for investments in early-stage startups. It
intends to participate in seed and series A rounds, said Managing
Director Marcus Stroud. The firm, which is led by millennials, aims to
invest in companies focused on the tech-savvy younger generation. The
firm is focused on three areas: financial technology, consumer
businesses and blockchain, Stroud said.

tackling the rise of remote workers

Bay Area employers are finding that to retain workers, they often need
to let them go.

Citing disillusionment with this region’s soaring home prices and
lengthening commutes, or seeking a more conducive environment for
raising a family, a growing slice of the Bay Area workforce is starting
to move away — and taking their jobs with them.

Flexible working is becoming a must for many. One recent report found a
quarter of UK workers have refused a job due to a lack of
flexibility[https://workplaceinsight.net/quarter-of-uk-workforce-have-turned-down-a-job-for-not-offering-flexible-working/].
This number jumps to 40% for *millennial* workers for whom work-life
balance and flexible working is key when evaluating a job prospect.

Air France has signalled the end for its Joon brand by launching a
review of the unit as it looks at integrating the carrier’s employees

¿Lo mejor? It’ll be in Spanish and English, so you can forward it to
your tía, your primo Lalo or anyone else (read: everyone).

In elementary school, I won a $100 savings bond in an essay contest.
“Guardalo,” my dad said, explaining that the longer I kept it, the more
valuable it would become. I tucked it into an old journal and mostly
forgot about it. In hindsight, it was the first time I made money from
writing, and I should have valued it more, but I was disappointed not to
have cold, hard cash.

LiquidFrameworks from Houston Ventures and other early investors. The
target offers cloud-based mobile field operations services for the
oilfield, industrial and environmental services industries.

and invoices, and allowing field service workers to process work orders
even when in remote areas that do not have an Internet connection. "By
focusing on customer needs, LiquidFrameworks has created a mission
critical software application used daily by field services professionals
across multiple verticals, and we look forward to finding ways to
provide further value to the industry,” says Luminate founder Hollie
Moore Haynes, who is a former managing director at Silver Lake Partners.
