Consumption of fermented food and drink has soared recently, but are
probiotic products really that beneficial?

When David Begg first approached pubs around the UK about the
possibility of stocking non-alcoholic
kombucha[https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/health-benefits-kombucha]
drinks, he was greeted with a mixture of bewilderment and defiance.

If there are any emerging design trends among the initial 2020 campaign
logos, it's the use of words over symbols, and the embrace of color
outside of the traditional red, white, and blue. Gone are the patriotic
single-letter presidential logos popularized over the past decade.

Julian Castro, for example, kicked off his campaign in his home city of
San Antonio with a logo that emphasized the accent in his first name,
rising like an airline tail mark and literally breaking outside of the
box. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, whose past Senate campaigns used blues and
teals, opted to frame her 2020 logo in pink, a color typically
associated in politics with activism, from the gay rights movement to
pussyhats. Spiritual author Marrianne Williamson also used pink.

(CNN) - Young women work longer hours and earn more than ever, but they
still carry a lot of domestic work on their shoulders. Even though
*millennial* households are more likely to adopt egalitarian views on
gender and want to share household chores and income equally, research
reveals that such promises often collapse under the weight of atavistic
gender stereotypes. On an average day, 19% of men reported doing
housework such as laundry, cleaning and compared to 49% of women. They
also spend more time each day doing these tasks, according to the US
Bureau of Labor Statistics. "I believe that the declared intentions and
the reality do not coincide, men still have the great privilege of being
able to resort to gender ideas, because if they do not, they have to get
involved a lot in domestic tasks and possibly renounce possible
professional advantages.

When ABC announced this week that “Modern Family” had been renewed for
its 11th and final season, and will wrap up for good in 2020, the
reaction was fairly muted. Sure, it’s always noteworthy when a
long-running show prepares to bid farewell, and some fans were sad to
hear the news — however, for most regular viewers, it just means the DVR
gets slightly less crowded.

Even if the collective reaction is a shrug, it’s worth looking back at
the comedy’s somewhat groundbreaking beginnings to remember it helped
change TV.

NEW YORK -- Gone are the days when the only goal of a company was to
persuade you to buy its product. Now, making you feel kinship with a
brand - even love - takes precedence.

At least, that's what a group of influential startups believe.

The news coursed through the sewers of Toronto society in the way it so
often does these days: via Instagram.

"Home ... where this ring belongs," declared Mary Symons, a self-styled
bon vivant, in a post she put up late last year, riffing on an image of
three interlocking gold bands. "Bought at age 18 in Florence," she went
on, "the #trinityring stands for #love #trust #friendship ... never let
it go where it does not belong."

WHEN pictures of Carla Bruni from her modelling heyday were juxtaposed
with those of Bella Hadid on Instagram this week, the striking likeness
left many social media users adjusting their screens in disbelief. Carla
has joked she has a 'hidden daughter', while Bella posted a picture of a
younger Carla in tribute. But the supermodel similarities do not end
with Carla and Bella. Here, ANTONIA HOYLE presents the catwalk queens

Roger says he's ‘only squeaking by' and open to all options, including
declaring bankruptcy

Roger's is the story of a young man – in his early 20s at the time – who
somehow was able to borrow well beyond his means to buy an expensive
vehicle. He didn't fully understand the terms of the loan, a
high-interest line of credit on which he pays interest only.

Frustrated by the designs and advertising of conventional lingerie
brands, Odessa Paloma Parker searches out the new players putting a more
sophisticated spin on underwear

There are plenty of things I've found egregious about Victoria's Secret
over the years: its tone-deaf cultural appropriation of headdresses and
“tribal" tattoos for the over-the-top get-ups on display at its annual
blockbuster catwalk show; the Train like an Angel YouTube videos that
bolster the idea that if you're going to dare to put on something lacy,
your body better be whipped into the best shape imaginable;
eyeroll-inducing collection names such as “Dream Angels" and “Sexy
Illusions."

If you've consumed any news this year, you've heard about U.S.
Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's signature proposal to raise her
country's top income-tax rate to 70 per cent. The idea, from the
standard bearer for the *millennial* wing of the Democratic Party, has
right-wing commentators apoplectic – “my God, it's socialism!" – and
many of the left cheering – “thank God, it's socialism!"

Meanwhile, Senator and presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren is calling
for a new tax on wealth – but on capital rather than annual income. It's
generating a similar response.

I started birding when I was a kid in the 1960s, and from time to time I
reflect back on the remarkable ways birdwatching has changed.

Technological changes such as the eBird platform, online rare bird
alerts and digital photography weren't imagined by most nature lovers
two generations ago. Ease of travel has also reshaped birdwatching. and
there is now a broader appreciation for conservation.

Gwyneth Paltrow has slammed a snarky critic who suggested she doesn't

After joking about the meme of an older woman wearing a pink dress that
reminded the actress and Goop founder of her 1999 Oscars look, one
follower took aim at her, suggesting someone else was behind her
Instagram correspondence.

IT'S true that a picture can paint a thousands words - but it can also
be used to try to paint over a sad and painful reality. A few years ago,
a friend asked me if my life was really as exciting as all the
photographs on my Facebook suggested.

The question gave pause for thought because, of course, I didn't spend
all my time partying and holidaying. Like everyone else, most of my
waking hours were spent sitting at a desk or attending the most
monotonous events.

When Kim Jong-un[https://www.scmp.com/topics/kim-jong-un]delivered his
annual New Year's address last month, the scene was unrecognisable from
his first speech as leader of North
Korea[https://www.scmp.com/topics/north-korea] six years prior. Gone
were the Maoist suit and lapel pin featuring the images of his father,
previous ruler Kim Jong-il, and grandfather Kim Il-sung, who founded the
country.

In their place was a suit and tie that would be at home in any office in
London or New York. Rather than sheltering behind a podium in an austere
auditorium, his voice faltering intermittently as it had before, Kim sat
composed in an armchair in a wood-panelled office.

India's first queer album, shot mainly in Fort Kochi, will be released
ahead of this V-Day

The music is striking, the lyrics sensual -- Breathe / Let it swirl /
I'm getting high / On the scent of my girl. When Mumbai-based musician
Pragya Pallavi, who refers to herself as genderfluid artist, sings
Lingering Wine, she puts a lot of emotion into this song about same-sex
love - its joys and sorrows, struggles and successes. It's a topic that
mainstream music and films are fidgety about.

Ten years ago, faced with mass bankruptcies and the very real prospect
of a re-run of the Great Depression, the US Federal Reserve took the
fateful decision to unveil a new policy called "quantitative easing" or QE.

This anniversary may seem unimportant but it should be commemorated
because the policy of QE arguably changed - or will change - politics
more profoundly than almost any other event or policy initiative in the
past decade.

OTHERS The dark humour in Cold Pursuit can be relished only if you’re
convinced about its intentions Cold Pursuit , Hans Petter Moland’s
remake of his 2014 Norwegian film, In Order of Disappearance , begins by
quoting Oscar Wilde: “Some cause happiness wherever they go; others
whenever they go”. Moland clearly relishes the humour in Wilde’s words
and interprets the latter half of that sentence in a rather twisted
fashion in this revenge drama.

BENGALURU: Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy's Rs 1.2 lakh crores
allocation could well be the magic wand that transforms the city into a
garbage-free, pedestrian friendly, well connected city with a modern,
multi-modal integrated transport system that ensures seamless
connectivity in the IT capital that is home to more than 10 million
people. It's the face-lift, the much awaited boost that both the active
*millennial* and the large workforce has been waiting for.

Mr Kumaraswamy's budget allocation clearly has one eye on the upcoming
crucial parliamentary polls, but the state government's bid to boost the
city infrastructure with its emphasis on setting up a commuter train
through a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) called Bengaluru-Rail
Infrastructure Development Entity (B-RIDE) at a cost of Rs 23,093 crore,
is the biggest budget takeaway; As is turning prime commercial streets
in Bengaluru such as Church Street, Commercial Street and Brigade Road
into pedestrian-only roads.

posting a $14 million sales loss and going into voluntary administration
in 2017, it was the heart starter the company needed to survive. A bonus
gift? A new creative director in Sophie Holt.

Eddie Dilleen has finally achieved the *millennial* dream of buying his
first home. It only took him 14 investment properties to get there.

The 27-year-old property mogul bought his first rental — a $138,000 unit
on the NSW Central Coast — at the age of 19 while still earning just
$500 a week working at McDonald’s , having saved all the way through
high school for a $20,000 deposit

Rumours of death exaggerated as old form returns from the dark side

Such Saturday mornings we will never see again: hours with the
headphones on, ensconced in a soundproofed booth listening to albums,
only to leave without buying anything. The fate of HMV — the bankrupt UK
record store chain bought this week by Canada’s Sunrise Records, with
the closure of many stores including the flagship on London’s Oxford
Street — recalled that of Woolworths when it died a decade ago. Many
people said it was among their favourite shops. Not enough of them
opened their wallets once inside.

With the Oscars just around the corner, there's never been a better time
to sample LA's hottest digs

LA is truly massive, a sprawl of separate cities connected by the
winding tentacles of ridiculously wide freeways. The downside of this is
that travel times between areas can be long but the payoff is a
colourful variety of neighbourhoods, from blissful beachesto the glamour
of Beverly Hills. Unsurprisingly, LA’s hotels are equally
diverse[https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/hotels/los-angeles-hotels-from-santa-monica-and-beverly-hills-to-hollywood-and-downtown-a6696611.html],
catering for every kind of trip imaginable. And with the 2019 Oscars
taking place on 25 February, it’s a great excuse to hunker down for a
stay. Whether you’re looking to party on the rooftops or just chill out
by the beach, these are my go-to LA hotels.

The ritual of exchanging details is just waiting for an overhaul driven
by technology.

It’s been a year since I handed over my last business card. It was at
the Japanese Prime Minister’s office in Tokyo, where I filled an awkward
silence with an explanation that the title, phone number and address on
my card were no longer correct, but my name hadn’t changed – an aside
lost in the halting translation that followed.

Soon after the turn of the 20th century, Sapa — a verdant Vietnamese
mountain town known for its terraced rice fields — became a stylish
retreat for French colonials who would take the train from Hanoi for
visits to their country villas and to a now-defunct sanitarium. Today,
travelers come to hike the misty trails linking Sapa to surrounding
stopped-in-time villages such as Ta Phin and Cat Cat, whose residents
sell handmade brocades and silver jewelry. For the new 249-key Hôtel de
la
Coupole[https://www.accorhotels.com/gb/hotel-A5V2-htel-de-la-coupole-mgallery-by-sofitel-opening-dec-2018/index.shtml],
set in a mustard-yellow building in Sapa’s Muong Hoa Valley, the
Bangkok-based architect and designer Bill Bensley was interested in how,
a hundred years ago, these types of artisanal goods made their way to
Paris and ended up influencing Western fashions.

HomeAdvisor is getting into the home warranty business after acquiring a
Texas startup that makes that experience easier and more on-demand.

Angi Homeservices (Nasdaq: ANGI), the combined company made up of
HomeAdvisor and Angie’s List, acquired Fixd Repair, executives said
Friday morning. The Fixd app aims to be the Uber of home renovation
services. It allows a homeowner to schedule, pay and actually watch a
contractor’s car on a map approach a user’s home — a feature called
“track my pro.”

Having weathered many adverse situations in the past three years to post
consistent growth, the prevailing sentiment in the Indian hospitality
industry is of confidence. The industry stakeholders feel that they will
be able to maintain the growth trend in 2019 notwithstanding the
aberrations of General Elections and its bearings on the policy level.
The reason for this confidence emanates not very much on the high
expectations on inbound visitors, but on numerous domestic factors
including the emergence of an aspirational young *millennial*
travellers, revival in corporate and business travel in the country, and
rapidly evolving connectivity factor in the country.

Real estate is the largest contributor to climate change, with 30% of
global carbon emissions, 40% of the world’s energy consumption and 40%
of the world’s resources being used in buildings.

Climate change is an inconvenient truth that business needs to address
and the property industry is beginning to embrace this reality.Starting

“You need something all the time!” Mara snaps at Jo. “It gets
difficult.” It’s a little comment, but one that’s been at least 10 years
in the making. After more than a decade of intense — and intensely
unbalanced — friendship in which the burden of emotional responsibility
has only ever belonged to her, Mara (Tallie Medel) finds that her
patience is starting to wear thin. Jo (Norma Kuhling) has just flaked
out on dinner plans for the a zillionth time, and then shown up at
Mara’s door at 12:40 A.M. in a fever about some other thing; she’s in
another one of her panics about being fired from another one of her jobs.

Some retirees are surprised to learn that Social Security is taxable.
The federal government taxes up to 85% of your benefits, depending on
your income. Most states, however, exempt Social Security from state
taxes. The list of 37 states that don't tax Social Security includes the
nine states with no state income tax, as well as some states that also
rank as the most tax-friendly states for retirees, such as Georgia and
Pennsylvania.

But beware: Some states that exempt Social Security benefits take a big
bite out of other types of retirement income. Maryland, for example,
excludes Social Security benefits from taxation, but distributions from
individual retirement accounts are fully taxed. Weigh all state taxes
when researching the best places to retire. For each state, we've
included a link to our full guide to state taxes on retirees.

Just hours after U.S. Rep. Brad Sherman’s congressional colleagues
released the framework for a Green New Deal in Washington, around 50
Valley residents and community leaders delivered a letter to his Sherman
Oaks district office Thursday morning to urge his support of the massive
policy package framework.

The legislation, introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.,
and Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., sets ambitious goals to cut carbon
emissions across the economy in a decade, from electricity generation to
transportation and agriculture. In that same vein, the proposal also
stresses policy goals like universal health care and a job guarantee
with special attention to poor, disabled and minority communities.

New data from the Brookings Institution shows how Austin has become a
magnet for *millennial* migration in the years since the Great Recession.

Growing companies — especially tech firms — put a premium on the number
of millennials an area has or is able to attract when considering
whether to relocate or expand in a certain market.

Decades-old games of racist dress-up may have destroyed multiple
political careers this past week, as news broke that not one but two of
Virginia's top elected officials — Gov. Ralph Northam and Attorney
General Mark R. Herring — had appeared in blackface years ago. Though
neither has resigned, the message in the backlash has been clear:
Actions have consequences, and old racist yearbook pictures can and will
be used to hold public figures to account. Others may soon learn that
the hard way: On Thursday, the Virginian-Pilot reported that the state
Senate majority leader had edited a 1968 yearbook that "features a host
of racist photos and slurs, including blackface."

Millennials are unfazed by the short supply of starter homes in a

Purchase loans occupied 88% of *millennial* originations in December, an
increase from 84% year-over-year. With interest rates rising from the

Consumers have been slower to migrate online to shop for certain food
items, compared to other categories such as personal care and
vitamins/supplements. However that behavior is starting to change with
frozen and refrigerated grocery items registering among the highest
year-over-year dollar sales growth rates, according to IRI's Q4 Consumer
Connect Survey of over 2,200 respondents.

At the end of 2018, consumer sentiment for online shopping was high
compared to recent years as nearly 55% of consumers reported their
households were in 'good financial shape' in Q4 2018, up 4% from Q3 2018
and 2% from Q4 2017.

2019 FEB 15 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at
Ecology, Environment & Conservation -- Investigators discuss new
findings in Basin Research. According to news reporting originating in
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, by VerticalNews journalists, research stated,
"Use of deep-water sediments in submarine fans to reconstruct changing
erosion onshore is based on the premise of relatively simple transport
between source and sink. However, debate continues regarding the degree
of sediment buffering and recycling in the sediment transport process."

Financial support for this research came from Charles T. McCord Chair in
Petroleum Geology at Louisiana State University.

2019 FEB 15 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Science
Letter -- Current study results on Science - Earth Science have been
published. According to news reporting originating in Jerusalem, Israel,
by NewsRx journalists, research stated, "Our understanding of sea-cliff
erosion processes and their response to recent and/or projected
environmental changes such as sea-level rise, climate change and
anthropogenic development hinges on our ability to quantify sea-cliff
retreat rates and their variability through time. Here, we focus on
Israel's Mediterranean 'Sharon' sea-cliff as a case study for examining
the significance of recent short-term (i.e. annual to decadal) cliff-top
retreat rates that appear to exceed longer-term rates of 'background'
(i.e. centennial to *millennial*) retreat by 1-2 orders of magnitude."

Financial support for this research came from Ministry of Energy.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The firm that sold Chelsea Market to Google for
$2.4 billion has joined three large brokerages, among others, to back
software designed to meet the growing demands of a *millennial*
workforce that is changing how office space is leased and managed.

Office workers now interact online or through smartphones and landlords
who ignore this trend will lose clients, said Michael Phillips,
president of Jamestown LP, a real estate investment firm that mixed
off-beat food and retail at Chelsea Market to make it a major Manhattan
destination.

I love the awesome stuff you can get these days. I was born in Soviet
Ukraine and grew up before the internet, before cell phones, before the
smart-everything, connected-everything, disposable-everything era. Don't
even get me started about groceries. My second favorite thing about the
United States is Costco and their cheap five-pound strawberry crates,
giant cheese wedges, and more.

Ownership Is a DragBut as much I love stuff, I hate owning things.
Ownership is a drag. As soon as I acquire anything, it begins to decay,
get outdated, and lose its relevance to me. Every single possession is a
liability and a responsibility.

In the most recent episode of the popular television show “Madam
Secretary,” a scene plays out in the house of the fictitious Secretary
of State Elizabeth McCord (played by Tea Leoni) where her son, Jason,
admits he is being entrepreneurial, and is running a business from home.

“SpectraCoin,” Jason announces. “It’s a cryptocurrency, and I’m mining
it, so I networked the house’s iPads, laptops and desktops.” When
Jason’s parents objected to such a move, he simply replied, “Look, I
made three grand this month.”

Marnie knows there’s something wrong with her. Every day she is plagued
by disturbing sexual images. She imagines herself inserting a high heel
into Lorraine Kelly’s vagina or licking the milk-splattered face of a

Scotland to London, desperately, hoping her friends and family never
