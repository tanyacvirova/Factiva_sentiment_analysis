Deloitte India CEO, N Venkatram says there is no pain without gain while
talking about the measures such as RERA, DeMon, IBC & GST. He says these
reforms did bring in pain initially, but they also ushered in more
discipline in the way businesses are done in India. Edited excerpts from
his interview with ET NOW:ET Now: The way India has done business in the
past versus the way India will do business now has that changed and will
that change more given the implementation of RERA, DeMon, IBC cases and
also the implementation of GST?N Venkatraman: If I look at India as a
generic term and to say that I would also look at individual businesses,
then all these factors have brought a lot more discipline. Yes, it did
bring in initial pain but then as the old saying goes there is no
pleasure without pain. To a certain extent you would have to go through
that phase. If you ask me, the results of IBC have been phenomenal.

Ubiquitous social media app ­WeChat is testing paywalls for ­official
accounts, opening up more monetisation opportunities for its content
creators on the mainland as internet users show willingness to pay for
online ­material.

Some official accounts, which are blog-like platforms, would be able to
charge readers either for selected original content or all posts, WeChat
said. Content creators can price ­articles from 1 yuan to 208 yuan
(HK$235), and WeChat will not take a cut of ­revenues during the trial
period.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An
earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the
year of the photograph, a view of the Jewish quarter of Baghdad. It was
taken in 1925, not 1975.

Having registered a sharp increase in market share in 2019, the Chinese
smartphone brand looks to raise the game

Part of the bouquet of smartphones from the Chinese smartphone company
BBK that also owns Oppo, Realme and One Plus, Vivo is being groomed in
the art of responsible branding. In a campaign launched earlier this
month, the brand has its endorser Aamir Khan being taught the first
lessons in developing a good phone-life balance by his son. A busy dad,
glued to his phone, while his wife and son wait at the dinner table,
Aamir Khan is schooled in the etiquette of family life in the
advertisement that has rapidly scaled the likeability charts on social
media.

Wiener is a keen social observer and scene-setter, especially attuned to
the hypocrisies of the hubristic young men of Silicon Valley.

When Anna Wiener was in her early twenties, her life resembled that of
any number of young New Yorkers with liberal arts degrees and writerly
aspirations. She answered phones at a literary agency and freelanced as
a copy editor, went to parties in Bushwick and dated men who made
chapbooks or furniture. After a few years - increasingly frustrated by
the rigid hierarchies of publishing, and unable to see a way out of the
“assistant class“ - Wiener quit the agency and took a temporary job at a
start-up selling e-book subscriptions.

Bigger doesn't necessarily mean better. The pace of private-equity
fundraising sometimes raises concerns among investors, as Preeti Singh
shows in her look at deliberations by Connecticut's main public pension
over investing in a new Clearlake Capital fund that's nearly twice as
big as its predecessor. On the other hand, as Ms. Singh also shows in a
look at the main Los Angeles County pension, increasing volume is
definitely better when it comes to co-investment deal flow.

Market size underlies the debate over letting Mom & Pop investors into
private-equity funds, a concept that went under the SEC's microscope in
Washington this week. Chris Cumming has details. Finally, Laura Cooper
worked the sidelines of the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San
Francisco this week to gauge the views of some participants on what's in
store in 2020. Our first installment appears below, so please read on...

S ometimes, a film turns out to be wholly the sum of its parts. So it
proves with Bombshell, to the last uneasy nanosecond exactly the version
of the 2016 Fox News sexual harassment scandal you would expect to be
made by Charles Randolph, writer of The Big Short, gonzo study of the
financial crisis, and director Jay Roach, whose career includes the
complete works of S. "He's not horny," Kelly shrugs. "He's just ambitious."

In there somewhere under state-ofthe-art prosthetics, Theron is so
eerily transformed into her character that at first, the resemblance is
all you see. The conjuring of disgraced CEO Roger Ailes is only a
fraction less uncanny, though here there are limits to the likeness. He
speaks and you squint again. Wait, why is Roger Ailes doing an
impression of John Lithgow? Nicole Kidman, conversely, is very obviously
herself playing longtime host Gretchen Carlson although not often.
Carlson, the first Fox presenter to publicly accuse Ailes, is here given
subtle second billing.

of the 2016 Fox News sexual harassment scandal you would expect to be
made by Charles Randolph, writer of The Big Short, gonzo study of the

Recently, an exasperated top media executive asked me a question: “What
is a progressive media company to do to keep their people happy?” He
ticked through the various programs the company had in place, its strong
culture, comparatively good pay. It is a discussion that plays out in
most conversations with top execs. No matter where the starting point,
conversations tend to veer to issues that make up the wild world of the
modern work experience.

Max Czollek, whose first nonfiction book is a rebuttal to calls for
integration, believes that his country must face its history with more
honesty — and that those who are singled out shouldn’t try to fit in.

ESSEN, Germany — Growing up in the 1990s in Berlin, the writer Max
Czollek remembers, he and classmates occasionally unearthed human bones
when they were playing outside their school. Years later, he learned
that the site had been used as a deportation center during the Holocaust.

Larry Fink's annual finger-wagging letter to chief executives has become

If you think EDM (Electronic Dance Music) is just repetitive groove
clothed in 21st-century party outfit, think again, especially if you are
dealing with a Filipino artist embracing the genre by being seriously
himself.

Frankly, Jace Roque is not your ordinary party-going dude trying to be
cool to be in. He is authentic in his craft and the subjects he deals

Are you Team Kate or Team Meghan? If you’re anything like me, you don’t
want to pick a side—and you don’t think there should be “sides” at all.
Yet ever since Meghan Markle married Prince Harry, parts of the media
have
pitted[https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/life/1222969/kate-middleton-meghan-markle-instagram-news]
the former actor against her sister-in-law.

Where Kate Middleton was once depicted as a dull social climber, she is
now presented as the epitome of female
virtue[https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10716974/kate-middleton-selfish-meghan-harry/]:
a respectable, silent, discreet, and selfless mother. Meghan must
therefore be her opposite—a political, manipulative, “woke” careerist.

KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 16 (Bernama) -- The ‘e-Tunai Rakyat’ programme
which distributes RM30 each to those eligible through e-wallet will
certainly contribute towards a cashless society and in
helping Malaysians especially from the B40 and M40 groups familiarise
themselves with electronic payments.   

Cashless payments are an attribute of the societies in developed
nations, and as Malaysia moves in that direction, its people and
merchants have to consider cashless payment methods too.

The last audiovisual work by Federico Fellini (Rimini, 1920 - Rome,
1993) adds six minutes to 10 seconds, and was not filmed for the cinema:
these are the three advertisements he directed in 1992 for the Bank of
Rome, and which illustrated a man's remorse for some adventures dream
extramaritales. A clear summary of the filmmaker's personality, whose
career was based on a huge baroque extravagance thanks to extraordinary
visual designs and his dreamlike drive ("dreams are the only reality,"
he said), and a love of the human being. Fellini belonged to a
generation of artists who were disactive in life and career, such as
Orson Welles, Sergio Leone and John Huston, who the Anglo-Saxons define
as than bigger life, characters that are almost unparalleled today.

The cabal of Coalition denialists calling the shots are still impervious

It’s time to face a dreadful truth. If this bushfire crisis, this
nation-wide trauma, can’t loosen the denialists’ grip on Coalition
climate policy, then maybe nothing will.

Meghan and Harry would be prototypical millennials, if millennials had
millions of dollars, unlimited connections and unprecedented global fame
and notoriety.

Like so many of us who have crossed the age of 30 threshold, they have
decided that now is the time to “work to become financially
independent.” They’re ready to move out of grandma’s house. Leave the
family business. Hopefully, they can stay on the family cellphone plan
until they figure out their next career moves.

In a year when many retailers are circling the drain, Target is
thriving. MediaPost is naming it its Media Client of the Year because —
after some bumpy years marred by errors like massive data breaches and
failed international expansion — it hasn't just learned from its
mistakes. It's emerged as the envy of the industry.

For one thing, it's smashing its own sales records and rolling out
dozens of tempting private-label lines, offering must-haves in
everything from baby clothes to adult beverages. For another, it's
owning all things digital, generating profitable growth from same-day
sales — a trick that eludes most of its competition.

This year, it's all about blue. Classic Blue, to be exact.

While previous years have seen the rise of coral, mustard and
*Millennial* Pink, the callers of all things colour - Pantone - have
dubbed the shade 19-4052 Classic Blue as the hottest (ahem, or coolest)
colour of 2020.

Derrius Quarles is a man of many modes, but he’s perhaps best known for
founding Breaux Capital,[https://www.breauxcapital.com/] an online
financial platform and community for black *millennial* men (the name is
a play on the word “bro”). Having read that 70 percent of black
millennials couldn’t afford a $1000 emergency, he created an app that
automates savings and co-invests the money with two friends: Ras Asan,
whom he met on a summer study abroad trip to Ghana, and Brian L.
Williams, a fellow graduate of Morehouse College. “We work with anything
from traditional ETFs” — exchange-traded funds — “to the cannabis
industry,” Mr. Quarles, 29, said.

The former mayor of South Bend came across as over-prepared and plastic
at January's Democratic debate

Pete Buttigieg has learned quickly. Except for a laugh he shared with
billionaire Tom Steyer toward the end of the second hour of last night’s
Democratic debate, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana came across
as robotic, plastic, and programmed to perfection. With every debate,
his learning curve is sharply increasing; his answers better informed,
more inclusive.

COLUMBUS, Ohio (BestWire) - Nationwide has launched a new *millennial*
generation-focused digital automobile insurance carrier, and Lead
Executive Scott Liles said it will consider rural versus urban driving
rather than factors like credit scores in setting rates.

The company also won't ask about employment, marital status or sex. Its
required telematics app merges driving behavior scores with a system
that scores the roads a policyholder drives, he said.

The week after CES, for those of us who attended, is a bit like the
aftermath of a powerful energy drink: it's incredibly invigorating at
the time, and then reality sinks in again on Monday with a thump. How do
we make sense of -- and practically apply -- what we have seen and learned?

One of the big questions coming out of CES is which innovations will
scale and have enough sustainable consumer interest. The next logical
question is which consumers will adopt the new technologies the fastest.

set to increase to 65 million by the end of 2030 which is currently
estimated to be less than 30 million.

KING OF PRUSSIA, PA / ACCESSWIRE / January 16, 2020 / Real estate author
and broker owner John Salkowski released his annual assessment of the
housing market. Salkowski says that a number of factors are going to
combine to make the residential real estate market more competitive in
2020 than in recent memory.

Salkowski says that tight housing inventory, economic and political
factors and demographic challenges from the Baby Boomer and *Millennial*
generations along with are converging. "House sellers think that if
housing sales are strong and prices are growing that it will be easy to
sell their homes." Says Salkowski. "But it is more important now for
sellers and buyers to be educated and informed than ever before."

Mehta will be busy promoting his debut web series - Never Kiss Your Best
Friend which premieres on Jan 20 on ZEE5.

Birthdays always call for a celebration. And when you have a new project
on release, then that celebration is bound to be on a whole other level.
Seems like the case with multi-faceted actor Nakuul Mehta who is all set
to make his OTT debut with ZEE5's web series Never Kiss Your Best
Friend. A *millennial* story of friendship and love - the show releases
Jan 20 and Nakuul's been painting the town red (or should we say neon
given the super fun looks he's been sporting) promoting the show. And
the promotional madness continues right through his birthday - with
interviews, specials and multiple appearances lined up for Jan 17 - His
Birthday.

NEW Don't Scream BBC3, from 6am What does it take to make a *millennial*
squeal? No, not just taking away their smartphone place them in a creepy
TV set dotted with mannequins and clowns, and put the wind up them. Each
time one of the spooked-out contestants wails in fear, £100 comes off
the £5,000 jackpot they stand to win for remaining stiff-upper-lipped
throughout. How do we apply? Death In Paradise BBC1, 9pm Last week's
opener was hammy even by the standards of this Caribbean spin on
Midsomer Murders. So expect more light bulbdetecting moments where you
can actually see someone pressing the switch in detective Jack's head as
he delves into Saint Marie's avantgarde art scene. Sherlock's Louise
Brealey and Matt King of Peep Show get the jammy guest gigs.

New Delhi, Jan. 16 -- In order to address the issue of mis-selling and
overcharging from investors in the capital market, the Securities and
Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has proposed a cap on investment adviser
fees and client segregation for entities providing both advisory and
distribution services. Sebi has proposed capping investment advisory
fees to 2.5% of the assets under advice (AuA) or a flat fee of Rs.75,000
per year. The regulator has also proposed client segregation rather than
business segregation for entities acting as both advisers and distributors.

The proposals were part of a consultation paper on Sebi-registered
financial advisers (RIAs) that the market regulator unveiled on 15
January. The paper noted that there have been numerous complaints from
customers about investment advisers offering assured returns, charging
exorbitant fees and mis-selling products.

YOUNGER people are turning their backs on the full English breakfast in
favour of *millennial* meals like avocado on toast.

It's a frying shame. They are missing out on a culinary institution that
would definitely leave them full of beans.

The other day my fella and I were watching an old-timey movie based in
the prohibition era, I think it was about Bonnie and Clyde but I'm not sure.

I am not inspired by this era for two reasons that are: No drinking. The
clothing would have been a disaster on this body of mine.

The great Indian wedding gets its docket for being extravagant,
over-the-top and exhaustive. But the moniker might soon be rendered
impractical for good. As young couples increasingly opt for waste-free
bungalows and minimalism over huge venues and opulence, weddings today
are getting intimate and niche. And with it, the food that we know and
queue up for at wedding counters are swiftly transforming, too.

As weddings turn into intimate affairs, couples look to design tight,
yet funky menus that reflect their personality, says Bhakti Mehta, the
owner of a Mumbai-based catering service, The Little Food Co. "Many
young couples are looking to have their weddings at compact venues like
a bungalow with an outdoor setting. It is not restrictive of the kind of
food we do. Even if it's familiar cuisine, the idea is to make it more
authentic. People know the ingredients of every dish nowadays," she
explains.

Have greeting cards become a thing of the past? Have they become a
tradition that will be completely wiped out by the rise of the internet
and social media? These were some of the questions running through the
mind of this writer during a visit to purchase a greeting card during
the yuletide season at one of the popular malls in Ikeja. The shelves
for cards are fast disappearing on low patronage from shoppers.

India, Jan. 16 -- While actors get a chance to shoot in foreign locales,
being in one city for almost two months is another feeling. Nakuul Mehta
can't stop talking about his 50-day-shoot in London, UK, for his new web
show. "It was wonderful to shoot in one of my favourite cities. But
after seeing the city as a tourist, while working, you see a different
side to it. We would hang out after shoot, I would visit parks on my
days off and check out the vibrant art, food and theatre scene," he says.

KOLKATA: Smart television maker Vu Technologies said the company has
managed to grow its volume sales by 14% in the current fiscal despite
the television category reporting a decline in unit sales in 2019,
chairperson Devita Saraf said.Saraf attributed this to the brand’s
*millennial* buyer base which it is targeting with customised products
and starting to sell through Amazon. Earlier, Flipkart was the primary
platform for sales.Vu has also exited the basic television range in
India. However, Saraf said by value the company will either hold onto
its 2018-19 revenue of Rs 1,000 crore or may report slight grow since
television prices have dropped last year across the range due to drop in
global panel prices. “Over 90% of our buyers are below the age of 40
years. Our televisions are customised both for picture and sound for
over-the-top media services and cricket.

Charlize Theron stars as anchor Megyn Kelly in an awkward film about
sexual harassment

Sometimes, a film turns out to be wholly the sum of its parts. So it
proves with Bombshell, to the last uneasy nanosecond exactly the version
of the 2016 Fox News sexual harassment scandal you would expect to be
made by Charles Randolph, writer of The Big Short, gonzo study of the
financial crisis, and director Jay Roach, whose career includes the
complete works of Austin Powers.

Former start-up employee Anna Wiener exposes the tech sector’s dark
side, with ‘sexism everywhere’

You don’t see too many corporate branded T-shirts and hoodies on the
streets of San Francisco these days. Twentysomethings used to wear logos
to show allegiance to Zynga or Dropbox or whichever well-funded tech
company employed them (and because the clothes were free). At the height
of the 2010s start-up boom they were ubiquitous. Now they seem to have
largely disappeared.

The San Jose City Council on Tuesday voted to approve a 19-story hotel
project adjacent to the historic Hotel De Anza in downtown and approved
an agreement to allow some hotel guests to park in a nearby public
parking garage for 10 years.

Despite opposition from some neighbors of the proposed Almaden Corner
Hotel at 8 N. Almaden Blvd. and some downtown businesses, the city
council approved a memorandum by Mayor Sam Liccardo, Vice Mayor Chappie
Jones and councilmembers Raul Peralez, Sergio Jimenez and Johnny Khamis
to ratify a parking agreement between the city and Almaden Corner LLC,
the owner of the hotel project site.
