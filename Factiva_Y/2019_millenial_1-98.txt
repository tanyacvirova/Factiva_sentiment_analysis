The presentation of Paloma Mami was one of the most anticipated in the
second day of Lollapalooza. Already an hour before the rise of the
19-year-old girl on stage, the vicinity of the Lotus Stage was full and
so did the audience through social networks.

And what the followers of the girl expected exceeded expectations. From
the first chord of the ex-Red, at around 6.15, the madness that ended
with a dozen drowned teenagers and the five paramedical teams under the
stage with a lot of fainting fits and hysteria attacks in the presence
of the Brunette who came out dressed in white and with evident
nervousness in her face, due to the high expectations of her show.

When Martand Singh, the renowned textile expert, decided to commission a
range of handspun and handwoven fabrics in the year 2000, it was to
reflect on where the form stood, at the turn of the millennium. By the
time the exhibition rolled around a couple of years later, in 2002,
Singh had a collection of 108 sarees, designed in Bengal and Andhra
Pradesh, made with fabrics gathered across nine states. That exhibition,
Khadi - The Fabric of Freedom, led by textile experts Rahul Jain, Rta
Kapur Chishti and designer Rakesh Thakur, travelled to Delhi, Mumbai,
Kolkata and Bengaluru.

Like many Gen-Yers and Millenials, former Blacktown beauty queen Aprille
Lim can’t bear to be without her phone. But as many of her generation
have discovered — water and mobile phones aren’t the best mix.

It was several years ago while holidaying on the Philippine island of
Boracay that Ms Lim devised Seaquatix cases — an ingenious idea to keep
her trusty electronic device waterproof.

Day 3 of the Bombay Times Fashion Week 2019 saw celebs sashaying down
the ramp in gorgeous outfits.It was all about the flair and flamboyance
of summer, coupled with elaborate gowns, lehengas and cocktail
dresses... and yes, a plethora of confidence, too. Day 3 of the fourth
edition of the Bombay Times Fashion Week 2019, at The St. Regis Mumbai,
saw a spectacular mix of Indian traditional outfits undergoing a
glamourous makeover. The day began with the Femina Flaunt show, followed
by a show by Sonali Jain and Meraki by Rashi N. Another show that made a
splash on ramp was Horra by Victor Robinson, which followed the Dheeraj
Sharma show that marked Sharma’s debut at any fashion week ever. The two
shows that followed were by Zarf by Masuuma Namjoshi and Soshai by Sofi.
KALKI’s modern romance-themed collection 'Zinnia’ made heads turn. The
grand finale by Delhi-based designer Suneet Varma was a stunning take on
bridal wear.

During the past several months, residents of Belfast and beyond have
been struggling with something that may be out of their comfort zones:
what it means to be queer.

That's because Mayor Samantha Paradis, a *millenial* who has described
herself as "visibly queer," has used the word a lot to help explain who
she is.

Thailand went to the polls Sunday for the first time since a 2014 coup,
authorities said, in a crunch vote pitting the junta against its old
political enemies and the untested new force of *millenial* voters.

Polls opened "at 92,320 polling stations across the country," Election
Commission secretary-general Jarungvich Phumma told AFP.

Editor's note: Julián Melo is CEO and Co-Founder of UBits. The opinions
expressed in this column belong exclusively to the author. (Expansion) -
Human Resources managers are questioning, and increasingly frequently,
how to train new generations, punctually the millennials. Recently I was
surprised to hear a Director of training and development of a major
company in the financial sector, concerned about the low effectiveness
and participation of the training and development plans she was
executing. Their concern revolved around the new generations, and their
difficulty to achieve good results in the training processes among this
audience. His statement closed with the phrase: "In conclusion, training
and developing millennials is almost impossible, they are overwhelmed,
they are distracted and impatient." His affirmation is associated to one
of the axes of greater work that the leaders of training have. For me,
the reflection revolves around how to train the future workforce?

Recently, in a meeting with young entrepreneurs, graduates of their
professional studies, they were asked about the skills they considered
indispensable for a good job performance.

It is important to note that the ages of these young people range
between 25 and 27 years, within the so-called *millenial*.

Quite simply, the news can not be understood without what the cell phone
represents and the use of data. The fact that any place has access to a
WiFi network is a necessary service, as indispensable as having napkins
in a restaurant.

Nowadays, it is rare to enter a public place and find people who are not
aware of your phone; among friends and even relatives, the scene in
which nobody is talking, but everyone is using the cell phone, has
become frequent.

New Delhi, Mar 15 (PTI) "I can't breathe. Should I stop going to
school?" "Kids need clean air". "No more excuses".

These were some of the phrases on placards Delhi-NCR students carried as
they joined the global "Fridays for Future" protest against climate
change, urging governments and authorities to tackle the problem.

A report by KPMG in 2016 estimated 107 million unmarried Indians between
18 and 35 years. A different study found that nine in every 10 Indian
millennials believe in true love. While it can be argued that numbers
don't tell the whole story, this particular statistic tells the heart of
young India - a cohort often unfairly accused of feeling less deeply
than generations past. And so, the question remains: where is this young
nation looking for love and what makes its quest so different from the
earlier generations.

Justin Trudeau's popularity and favourability ratings are taking a
beating and an awful lot of it has to do with the SNC-Lavalin scandal.

The latest poll from the firm, Campaign Research shows the Liberals
trailing the Conservatives nationally by six points and Trudeau's
approval rating below 30%.

“New York developer Related Cos. is set on Friday to open what will be
the largest private development in the U.S. The $25 billion project on
Manhattan’s west side features office towers, thousands of apartments, a
giant mall and green spaces designed to attract people with light and
airy architecture. But behind the scenes, this city-within-a-city is
designed like a fortress. The developers incorporated lessons from
recent storms, terrorist attacks and freakish occurrences in New York
and around the globe. Hudson Yards’ gatekeepers have devised a plan to
keep out the bad elements, whether criminals or acts of nature.” (Wall

Tbilisi. March 12 (Prime-News) –Brothers George, 29, and Shota Mikaia,
22, grew up in war torn Georgia and understand intrinsically the
importance of freedom—something that was often illusive in their lives
where struggle and hardship were the norms growing up. For years,
Georgia was engulfed in wars, with the brothers’ home region of Abkhazia
hit the hardest. Yet, despite the horrors of what they witnessed, the
brothers were still inspired by their country’s beautiful landscape and
rich traditions—including shoemaking.

King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard will release a new LP, Fishing for
Fishies, on April 26th via ATO/Flightless Records.

The prolific psych-rockers previewed the record with the ebullient
singalong title-track, a warped nursery rhyme in which
multi-instrumentalist Stu Mackenzie sings about feeling disgusted by the
act of fishing. “I don’t want to be fishing for fish/I just want to let
them freely swim,” he sings over a colorful swirl of fingerpicked
electric guitars, honking harmonica and brushed drums.

become a business idea after moving to Australia as a 13-year-old.

WOMEN have changed a lot over the generations including what they wear
and where they work.

But new research shows they have also changed what they drink. The
research, conducted by Cairns-based brewing company The Great Northern,
showed 69 per cent of *millenial* women had drunk beer in the previous
four weeks, making them twice as likely to enjoy the beverage than their
Baby Boomer counterparts.

If a few months ago it was reported that the value of the business
empire of the young Kylie Jenner was dangerously close to one billion
dollars-or trillion, according to the Anglo-Saxon scale, to be set at
900 million the price of his company 'Kylie Cosmetics' , the television
star can finally boast of having become the youngest billionaire in the
world who, of course, has reached such a sum with the sweat of his brow
and an extraordinary sense of smell for business.

It has been, of course, the specialized magazine Forbes which has
officially certified the feat performed by the benjamina of the
television Kardashian clan, who has also granted a brief interview to
the media to express their satisfaction with the iron health of his
firm. and the accolade that this implies for their own self-esteem.

congolmerate, worked through attendance issues at the site in upstate
New York. Woodstock 50 is expected to draw 100,000 fans for the event
produced by Michael Lang, co-founder of the orginal 1969 Woodstock

Idris Elba sparked a fan frenzy with his recent Golden Globes selfie
with Daniel Craig, so More asked the actor to spill the secrets on his
plans for world domination (and it wasn't what we were expecting…)

I dris Elba is careering across a crowded dancefloor. Agitated and
sweaty, he's very much the worse for wear as he lurches into a pack of
unsuspecting clubbers. No one dares push back. It takes two bouncers,
both bigger than the muscular 6ft 2in actor, to calm him down and get
him to leave the club.

Dive right into this warm and versatile colour, writes Robyn Willis

Every year, paint company Pantone announces its colour of the year. But
as the self-appointed “global authority on colour”, Pantone’s choices in
the past couple of years have proven a challenge to use in interior design.

attest to that.

Over one month of rehearsals, he watched expat bluesman DC Rapier
transform from an aging man trying to cross off his bucket list to an
energetic teenager hitting the stage for the first time at his hometown
battle of the bands.

The people of the Mexican state of Oaxaca earn their living making
pulque, a traditional drink made with Agave. But the beverage,
considered sacred, is under threat. Ecotourism is part of the solution
to save it.Project aim: Save the tradition of making pulque, a drink
made from the sap of the agave, reclaim eroded soil and prevent future
soil erosion in the Mexican state of Oaxaca.

Project implementation: The Mujeres Milenarias ("*Millenial* Women"), a
local community organisation set up to preserve the pulque tradition,
plant agaves in a special formation, so their roots form nets that keep
water and nutrients in the soil.

The third edition of a two-day thought conclave was held in the city
recently. Several weighty topics were chosen for the eminent group of
panelists to wrap their heads around: suffice it to say it was rather
like the curate's egg, good in parts. Take for example the topic,
“Reforms: Time for Version 2.0”. Any captain of industry worth his salt
would have feasted on it with the relish displayed by an unleashed
Rottweiler for the fleshy calves of a Cubbon park jogger.

Instead we were subjected to tedious lectures by a bunch of preening,
self-congratulatory panelists who held forth at length about the
fantastic achievements made in BPO. One of them channeled his inner Baba
Ramdev as he patted himself on the back with yogic suppleness, prior to
rattling off a bunch of stats to highlight how “his team were now
providing services that the US clients hadn't even dreamt of…” or words
to that effect.

2019 FEB 22 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Science
Letter -- Investigators publish new report on Science - Quaternary
Science. According to news reporting originating in Plouzane, France, by
NewsRx journalists, research stated, "The mechanisms governing the
development of deep-sea fans is a matter of debate and their
understanding at Milankovitch and *millenial* time-scales is challenged
by complex architectures and the lack of material suitable for
establishing reliable chronostratigraphies. Based on a detailed
investigation of the emplacement of channel-levee-lobe systems and their
successive bifurcations and seaward-landward migrations (Picot et al.,
2016), we present for the last 210 ka a detailed chronostratigraphic
framework of the migration pattern based mainly on radiocarcarbon dating
of channels and lobes abandonment or initiation."

Harlequin THE UNIVERSAL Last week we left our hero in a battle against
the mummies, now he is fighting against two other arch enemies of the
4T: the fifis grasshoppers and the dangerous bottle cartel. And in less
than what a goose sings, it already hit the heart of the centers of
indoctrination of conservatives and enemies of the Fourth Bolivarian
Transformation. Thanks to the intelligence services, which are now no
longer dedicated to spying on officials but to combat the real threats,
it was discovered that these hotbeds of conservatives and fifis operated
undercover as children's rooms, and immediately, began an operation to
exterminate these houses in which children were prepared for the
counterrevolution.

February 14 seems to leave couples scratching their heads for ideas.
While many Gujaratis are trading predictable Valentine's Day proposal
ideas for something more personal and subtle, some still believe in
old-school romance made of lovey-dovey cards, heart-shaped stuffed toys,
a box of chocolates or a ring for proposal on the day of love. "I love
Valentine's Day. A lot of people believe its hyped but so what? If a
couple hasn't known each other for long then it's a perfect occasion to
show your partner how much you care," says wedding planner and gifting
expert Ayushi Garg adding, "For married couples or people dating for a
while, it's a good reason to take some time out and add a little spice
to mundane things."We speak to *millenial* Gujaratis and find out all
about their idea of proposal on V Day.

Florida is growing fast, and Northeast Florida along with it. However,
in order for Northeast Florida to remain competitive against nearby
cities, the region must move swiftly on talent development, JaxUSA
Partnership President Aundra Wallace told the Business Journal in a
sit-down interview Monday.

"The demographics, employment, economics - everything about Florida is
changing," Wallace said. "To compete now, from a regional aspect,
whoever wins the war over talent attraction, talent development and
talent retention will now be better positioned to win more of the
battles over the attraction and expansion and retention of companies."

Cristina Simón (*) As has been happening in recent years, the
possibilities opened by technology give way to a new conception of work:
the communities of so-called digital nomads. They are basically
professionals of the *Millenial* generation who decide to dispense with
the spatio-temporal ties marked by the traditional forms of labor
relationship and work while traveling. Initiatives such as Selina.com
organize physical spaces in destinations of tourist interest so that
these young digital nomads have access and adequate places to develop
their activity.>> Obviously this option is not for everyone, nor of
course for all the positions of work. Those activities that require
close attention to the customer or physical presence (manufacturing or
certain services) are not susceptible to nomadism in general.>> However,
it is interesting to analyze what this form of work represents.

Baja California, Hidalgo, Jalisco, Nuevo Leon and Sonora are some of the
states where you can find real estate in less than 1.5 million pesos,
real estate agency Propiedades.com said.

In a statement, the company reported that, according to the study
conducted by HSBC entitled "Beyond the bricks. The meaning of home ",
94% of young Millennials, people born between 1983 and 2000, plan to
acquire a home in the next five years.

IT'S been a bit of a slow start to the year, TV-wise. Most shows have
only just returned from a production break. And FBI, the third season of
This is Us and the buddy-cop offering Bulletproof have been getting
viewers to gleefully tune in.

I found myself drawn to God Friended Me while browsing through my
options on DStv CatchUp. Admittedly, it was the Facebook association
that influenced my viewing choice from a catalogue saturated with gritty
crime dramas, poignant family dramas, reflective home-grown offerings
and refreshing comedies - and a few obscure shows.

Hyderabad: You want to get the attention of millenials who live and
breathe the web, then Instagram is the way to go. For these first-time
voters, Twitter is passé and Facebook is a yawn. But politicians and
social media strategists seem not to have grasped this, because their
weapons of choice to influence young voters are still Facebook and
Twitter, which have lost fame among millenials who are now on Instagram
24x7.

But Union minister Smriti Irani, YSRC MLA R.K. Roja and Congress leader
Shashi Tharoor are among the politicians who speak the millennial lingo
on Instagram. From sharing family moments to keeping a track of the
week, the two actor turned politicians are attracting people on
Instagram. Not many of the younger lot of politicians are using this
platform, which is actually surprising. Even tech savvy leaders like
K.T. Rama Rao and Pawan Kalyan are yet to make a debut, but TRS MP K.
Kavitha and YSRC's Vijay Sai Reddy are upping their game.

AFGHANISTAN-US ENVOY — Negotiators for the U.S. and the Taliban
insurgents have reached “agreements in principle” on key issues for a
peace deal that would end 17 years of war in Afghanistan, the top U.S.
envoy says. The statement by U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad followed six
days of talks last week with the Taliban in Qatar. By Rahim Faiez. SENT:

The exclusive clubs for men, where whiskey, cigars and business talks
abounded, are a thing of the past. The architecture office NO. 12,
founded by Katie Earl and Emma Rayner, gave all the character that the
first women's club in London would need, and with its architecture, The
Allbright now speaks of a timeless feminism through design.

Very deliberately, the tone of the place is far from this type of space
that accentuates a decoration in pink tones. The AllBright is completely
different in that sense. Beginning with the context, the club is located
in the heart of the Bloomsbury neighborhood, a site with a strong track
record that includes the writer Virginia Woolf and her Boomsbury Clan, a
group of twentieth-century English intellectuals who used to roam the area.

It seems every few weeks an announcement is made that blames millennials
for killing another industry.

From diamonds to restaurant chains and home ownership, it is declared
that millennials should be ridiculed for the hand they play in
destroying these ageold traditions.

Every day this week, Carly Towne, 25, has pulled herself out of bed in
the morning dark to walk a 7 a.m. picket line at Venice High School for
two hours before heading to work. The bespectacled staff member of
left-wing activist organization Code Pink is not a teacher, a parent nor
a former L.A. Unified School student.

Like the 100 to 150 other members of Democratic Socialists of America
and International Socialist Organization who have showed up to schools
every day this week in support of the L.A. Unified teachers strike,
she’s simply a devoted socialist.

When vice-presidential candidate Ma'ruf Amin finally spoke up after
being silent for around 30 minutes during the first presidential debate
on Thursday, nearly 100 supporters from both camps watching the live
telecast held their collective breath, quietly anticipating what he was
about to say.

However, both sets of supporters, even those donning plain white shirts
as a sign of support for the incumbent president, Joko "Jokowi" Widodo,
burst out in laughter when all the cleric said was "I have nothing to
add," on a topic related to potential conflicts between law enforcement
and human rights.

Every year, paint company Pantone announces its colour of the year. But
as the self-appointed “global authority on colour”, Pantone’s choices in
the past couple of years have proven a challenge to use in interior design.

So after the vibrancy of Greenery in 2017 and the boldness of last
year’s deep purple Ultra Violet, the nominated colour for 2019 is a
soothing balm.

New Delhi, Jan. 14 -- The characteristics of the millennials when
compared to non-millennials are like chalk and cheese. A 2017 KPMG
report Meet the Millennials says that 50% of the global workforce by
2020 will be millennials, and that leaves organizations with no choice
but to start readying themselves to on-board a section of employees
whose alignments are different from the existing and outgoing workers.

But what are the ways in which companies can actually do this? "We are
working towards driving an informal, non-hierarchical, flexible and
collaborative culture to adapt to the millennials," says Rajashree
Nambiar, managing director and CEO at Fullerton India Credit Company
Ltd, a non-banking financial company headquartered in Mumbai. Yet,
revamping cultures take time and some realignments.

OTHERS Designer couple Falguni and Shane Peacock on the importance of
staying grounded The last time I met Falguni Peacock, she was
accompanied by husband and fellow designer Shane. This time she is
alone, leaving him to take care of the backstage details at their Vogue
Atelier show that was held in Chennai last month. Almost three years
later, nothing else has changed — we still meet in a hotel lobby, have
green tea and chat easily. It is almost surreal to think that she is the
same person whose creations are worn by the likes of Beyonce, Jennifer
Lopez and Lady Gaga. Clad in her signature all-black — lace bomber
jacket, tee, pants and nails — Falguni says, “Being grounded is very
important to me.

TECHNOLOGY

WHEN your phone buzzes with a push notification from a news app, what do
you do? Read and instantly forget? Open the report and read with
interest? Or pass it off as more noise from a constantly-buzzing device?
Media outlets have been trying for some time to figure out how best to
use push notifications to serve and retain readers. According to a new
report, digital newsrooms are beginning to treat push notifications as a
platform that's every bit as important as other brand and distribution
channels, like homepages and email newsletters.

A new Storm Boy is about to hit the big screen, showcasing SA’s
spectacular scenery to the world — but the troubles of big star Geoffrey
Rush have caused unexpected turbulence

It’s a blustery day at Port Elliot on South Australia’s South Coast and
everyone is hunched against the wind. Off to one side, Hollywood
muscleman Jai Courtney is skylarking with Finn Little, the sweet-faced
Queenslander who beat a generation of hopefuls to the role of young Mike
Kingley, better known as Storm Boy.

India, Jan. 5 -- Meet Tanya Shaukat, a young woman complaining about the
Careem cab driver, a mother perpetually worried for her daughter's
safety. Her story begins in a newsroom and continues to a wedding hall,
covering the formation and destruction of relationships in between.

Meet Taha Kehar, journalist and author, the creator of Tanya Shaukat,
the heroine in his book titled Typically Tanya. The protagonist of the
novel is female, but the book is about his experiences in a newsroom,
his feminism and his observations of a woman's relationship with public
spaces in a city as prone to violence as Karachi.

An interview with Max Harrell, loan officer at Generations Bank is
presented. Harrell said that, banks can appeal to millennial as
customers by providing quick and easy service at the touch of a button
or screen in most cases. Millennial are doing more, more efficiently and
banks should take notice. Millennial pursuit is to make things as simple
and easy as possible and this includes our banking. Banking is a service
and we, as bankers, need to recognize that. We are constantly in
competition not only with other banks but other service industries as
well. My bank has been a participating partner with the Clover Community
School in Bentonville. The Clover Community School provides hands on,
project based education for students who desire to learn in an engaging
environment.
