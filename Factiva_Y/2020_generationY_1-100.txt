Coupled with the emergency decree, the market this year is expected to
grow 17% from 33-35 billion baht in 2019," Anantaporn Lapsakkarn, senior
researcher at K-Research, told the Bangkok Post.

YOUNG workers are shaping up to be an employer’s dream as new research
finds they are more likely to update their skills and less likely to ask
for a pay rise.

Human resources firm Adecco’s 2020 Salary Guide finds just 22 per cent
of under-30s asked for a pay rise last year compared to a 26 per cent
workforce average.

online businesses has focused on the adoption of e-commerce and initial
purchase behavior; repurchase intention and its antecedents remain
underresearched. The present study develops an empirical model to
explore the extent to which trust and e-satisfaction mediate the effect
of vendor-specific attributes and customer intention to repurchase from
the same online platform."

WHEN Queen Elizabeth visited our shores in 1954 - during the height of
one of the terrible polio epidemics that periodically swept our country
– she was banned from shaking hands in Western Australia.

Well-wishers had to keep six feet away (1.8m), children told not to hand
up flower posies and spade handles wrapped in cloth.

The U.S. Census Bureau reports that all of the baby boomers will be age
65 or older by the year 2030. That is an estimated 73 million people
that were born after World War II from 1946 to 1964. The upcoming 2020
census will put an updated frame on this picture, but the next decade
could redefine how the entire workforce functions, including HVAC.

Workolic, caNeologism built as tracing of English workaholic ,
'workaholic person'. It is a colloquial word preferable to partially
adapted workanolic Anglicism, which already appears in the DLE as
Chileanism (with the Brand Chile). There is no english voice
corresponding to the English shopaholic , 'person addicted to commercial
stores'.MillennialThis is what the "millennial generation" (also called
"*generation Y*") or millennials have been called, characterized, among
other things, by their familiarity with digital technologies. It is a
raw Anglicism, not adapted to Spanish, which seems to be ephemeral, as
are in general the names of generations, which can pass to the available
lexicon of people to name this age segment. It already starts
circulating as the name of the next generation centennial.

Despite armchair analysts’ tired observation that business that “go woke
go broke”, employees who work at those companies want them to continue
to value their contribution to climate change and mental health, among
other issues.

A new survey of 1214 employees across a variety of industries and
generations towards the end of last year revealed employees want the
businesses they work for to be as concerned about their impact on
society as they are with how much money they make.

An increasingly serious coronavirus outbreak and a surprise change of
Chancellor have upended early predictions of what might be in the Budget
next Wednesday.

As the health threat mounts and overshadows many more mundane concerns,
Rishi Sunak might be forced to tailor his speech around a crisis
prevention strategy rather than post-election winning giveaways or major
reforms.

Searching for academic information beyond the enlocated Google,
interacting as in class, but virtualally making self-edited audiovisual
shorts to teach demonstrate that the use of Information and
Communication Technologies (ICTs) stages a new landscape in the
classroom and gradually changes the profile of teachers and students.
But, most importantly, it gives several advantages beyond how attractive
a device or app can be. What are the real benefits?

The Director of Virtual Education at the Universidad Privada del Valle,
Aaron Rioja, emphasizes that the use of technology in the classroom
brings several advantages in academic terms such as: time savings,
student motivation and better understanding of concepts. However, it
clarifies that this is possible as long as ICTs are accompanied by good
pedagogy. "At the end of the module and/or semester, technology will
continue to be one more medium, not an end," he adds.

Travellers from across the globe, representing all generations, now have
a common interest in activities and experiences that are now
influencing, indeed in many cases driving their travel decisions,
according to new research from Expedia Group Media Solutions.

The research underscores the notion that cultural and once-in-a-lifetime
experiences, exploring new destinations and interactive activities, are
ranked by all generations significantly higher than value or a
discounted price.

As the world's digitalisation has become an opportunity as well as a
challenge for many, some information technology experts are organising a
one-day Digital Pakistan Conference at the Pearl Continental Hotel on
April 15 to address the potential and grievances of the virtual marketplace.

Addressing a news conference at the Karachi Press Club's seminar hall,
AMFCO Technologies CEO Maroof Ayub said that in this country people may
not have electricity reaching their homes but they have at least one
smartphone in their family, which creates a huge progress opportunity.

With the growth of today's multigenerational workforce, business leaders
need to broaden their perspective and adjust their expectations. Instead
of managing a homogeneous culture, managers are now dealing with
millennials (35%), Generation Xers (33%) and baby boomers (25%),
according to the Pew Research Center. The remaining 7% are a mix of
entry-level Generation Zers and unretired members of the Silent Generation.

Pew breaks down the generations by the following birth-year ranges:

There's no single reason that leads someone toward becoming a financial
advisor and starting their own firm.

Some get restless working for a large financial services company. Others
crave the flexibility to set their own schedule and create a business
that fits their preferred lifestyle. Younger professionals may set up
shop to test their entrepreneurial chops while harnessing the latest
technology to automate their operation.

Whether you're a seasoned pro or are newly independent, using social
media to connect with clients is no longer an option but a must in terms
of marketing for financial advisors.

The question rather lies in what goals to pursue with social media, what
your target audience is, what platform to use and what kind of content
to share. In addition, compliance is an important consideration in this
business.

On a Sunday morning a few weeks ago, Natalie and Dan Slagle took a
two-hour nature walk. They weren't thinking about business ideas for
couples. They were just enjoying the scenic beauty and romping in the snow.

For many married couples, such an outing hardly qualifies as special.
But when you work together all week in close quarters, as the Slagles
do, setting aside leisure time takes on more importance.

The cutoff for being born into Generation X was about 1980, the cutoff
for *Generation Y* (a.k.a. the Millennials) was about 1996, and the
cutoff for Generation Z was about 2010. What should the next batch of
babies be called—what comes after Z?

2020 FEB 20 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at
Politics & Government Week -- A new study on Global Views - Youth
Research is now available. According to news reporting originating in
Brisbane, Australia, by VerticalNews journalists, research stated, "This
article is interested in a techno-cultural moment usually summarized by
the phrase 'digital age'. We explore how people who belong to
*Generation Y* and were young at the time of the development of digital
music technologies have adopted and used those new technological
possibilities while maintaining a relationship with other media and
technologies, such as the compact disc (CD), the vinyl disc and,
eventually, the cassette tape."

Thriftiness is one thing, but cheapskates are a farmer’s pest, says
agri-consultant Belinda Hazell

IT all comes back to the value of scratch cooking. That’s what they call
dinner prep with fresh and staple ingredients in the UK.

Filipino director Raya Martin was caught out, for a moment, when first
pitching the project that would eventually become his latest feature,
Death of Nintendo. Then he decided to simply tell it like it is.

"This film is Stand by Me … with circumcision," Martin remembers saying,
referencing Rob Reiner's 1986 classic.

This movie looks and sounds like a bad student film

After watching 'Love Aaj Kal (2020)', admirers of director Imtiaz Ali
will be in a state of shock. A film maker can have lapses in creativity.
Production problems could plague him. Actors may let him down. He might
run out of money. But, surely, the flowing, lyrical and cinematic style
that he demonstrated so well in a range of films like 'Jab We Met' or
'Highway', ought to be second nature to him. What is confounding is that
the refined film technique we have seen and liked in his oeuvre, goes
missing here. This movie looks and sounds like a bad student film.

Some of the protagonists of this report confess that they are about to
turn their careers around and do so without drama. Others have
transcended musical genres that for some of us are still avant-garde and
almost look at you strange when you mention it. One of them is about to
crown the pinnacle of fashion, but his real ambition is to take off his
driver's license. They are designers, musicians, models, artists,
performers or actors. The youngest is 15, the oldest is now 40. There
are those who have barely left their bedroom, others are taking their
first steps and are not even quite sure what will be next. But there are
also stars of stratospheric tv outlets, established creators, musicians
who perform at international festivals and award-winning performers.

Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank, the biggest Sharia-compliant lender in the
emirate, reported a 4 per cent rise in the full-year net profit, as
revenues climbed and income from investments rose.

Net profit for the 12-month period ending December 31, reached Dh2.6
billion, the bank said in a statement to the Abu Dhabi stock exchange,
where its shares trade. Operating profit increased 4.4 per cent to
Dh3.26bn, boosted by a 30.7 per cent increase in investment income. A
23.6 per cent rise in foreign exchange income also helped a rise in
annual operating profit.

Travellers from across the globe representing all generations now have a
common interest in activities and experiences that are now influencing,
indeed in many cases driving their travel decisions, according to new
research from Expedia Group Media Solutions.

The research underscores the notion that cultural and once-in-a-lifetime
experiences, exploring new destinations and interactive activities, are
ranked by all generations significantly higher than value or a
discounted price.

which the re-energized Trump, after the failed impeachment, has made his
shot at propaganda target to fly the goodness of Wall Street capitalism
that has brought his actions into the stratosphere, in contrast to its
economy that exhibits a patent mediocrity - except for the aristocratic
digitalic economy of Silicon Valley.

Young people in the US have lost faith in capitalism and now embrace
socialism, while Bernie Sanders' main health care proposal, a
self-confessed Democratic Socialist, who waves the health care flag for
all who has attracted millennials and moved the Democratic Party

*Generation Y* customers are increasingly satisfied with the way their
banks dole out advice via digital channels, and that’s driving an
overall improvement in customer satisfaction, according to a recent J.D.
Power study.

Out of all the generational cohorts surveyed in the firm’s third annual
retail banking advice study, people born between 1977 and 1995 were the
most satisfied with retail banking advice. Overall satisfaction scores
for that group, often referred to as millennials, jumped 10 points from
last year, to 855 on a 1,000-point scale.

Millennials looking to refinance MILLENNIAL homeowners are cashing in on
historically low home loan interest rates and are jumping at the chance
to refinance their mortgages. Once labelled the lazy generation,
Millennials are shaping up to be a financially savvy bunch.

According to data from comparison website Finder, 30 per cent of those
surveyed aged between 18 and 39 said they would refinance in the next 12
months, effectively shaving tens of thousands of dollars off their
mortgages. That is compared to just 2 per cent of Baby Boomers who said
they would speak to their lenders.

generation can shirk parenting responsibilities.
