Yogeshwar Sharma Ceo And Executive Director, Select CitywalkDigital
fashion collections, 3D printed garments, experiential retail,
videobased searches, AI, and an ever-growing awareness towards social
and personal styles, the fashion industry is changing rapidly. These are
quick to be taken over by malls and other retail segments. India’s
retail structure is such that it becomes an incredible assortment of
formats. Over the past years, the concept of mall shopping has
drastically changed and evolved in terms of composition and consumer
purchase behaviour. Many other factors that have made fashion retail
reach where it is today is the brand consciousness, modernization, and
infrastructural development. This has defi ned the changing dynamics of
retail spacesmore prominently in the fashion category.On average, 64
percent percent of a mall’s revenue is generated by its fashion stores.

The fashion retail industry is on a meteoric growth trajectory and a lot
of credit for this goes to shopping malls. The presence of shopping
malls in every city – Tier I, II & III – has made a major impact on the
shopping behaviour of the Indian consumer. Today’s *Millennial*
consumers want the best of fashion and prefer malls to high streets to
discover this segment because this is where they can find a plethora of
fashion brands under one roof…Shopping malls in India have always been
an epicentre of fashion brands. You think of a mall and the first thing
which comes in mind is the number of fashion stores present in the mall,
attracting customers with their new collections and latest trends.Indian
consumers have a deep-rooted association with fashion and luxury, and
this is a proven theory. According to a Euromonitor International
report, fashion – which comprises the major portion of the luxury goods
segment – has been on a continuous growth spree since 2014.

A new JLL report has touched upon a few key trends, and why their focus
on consolidation is very relevant today, especially since the retail
sector has started witnessing an increase in mergers and
acquisitions...The Evolution of Organised RetailTowards the end of the
previous millennium, organised retail as a concept started gaining
traction in India. Malls started coming up in top Indian cities like
Mumbai, Delhi and Chennai. There was a novelty factor attached with
shopping malls which led to decent footfalls right from the
beginning.The retail sector started growing at a rapid pace. With an
increased spending capacity among consumers, developers started sensing
an opportunity and started constructing malls. This led to an increase
in the number of malls in the country. Consumers had the luxury of
fulfilling their shopping needs – primarily apparel, accessories, food &
beverage, electronics, etc– in air conditioned spaces.

The fit Navy Seal, the gun-toting *millennial*, the subway hook-ups with
younger men... Jane Mulkerrins discovered two simple rules of dating
when she swapped London for Brooklyn. 1. Don’t get hung up about
exclusivity. 2. Don’t worry about your age. Go, girl!

It’s a sticky, sultry summer evening and I’m perched on a stool in a
Brooklyn bar, perspiring rather unprettily into my gimlet. The young man
I’m here on a date with doesn’t seem to care, however, and is doing
nothing to help cool things down, persistently propelling his left hand
further up my thigh than I’m permitting in public. Generally, I’m a big
fan of a bar fondle, but this is my local, and it’s still light outside;
there are families wandering past the window who don’t need to see this
show. And, when I say young man, I mean young. He is, at time of
groping, 23 years old, to my comparatively geriatric 40.

Since he entered the scene in 2016, it can be said that LA Santos has
successfully carved a name for himself in the local music industry.

Looking back, the talented lad started to make his presence felt by
serving as front act for highly established artists like Patti Austin,
the Stylistics, Air Supply, and Jukebox royalties Imelda Papin, Claire
dela Fuente, and Eva Eugenio. This paved the way for his grabbing a
music contract under Star Music.

Fashion is facing a reckoning, but a highly unequal one. And no, we are
not in it together.

For retail, this is painful, but for others it’s existential. The idea
that we’re protecting designers and stores and bailouts on this side,
but neglecting the factory support we get from around the world on the
other, is unequal. The future capability to operate on speed and agility
depends on a system that supports these garment factories. The fix for
it is economic, above all else.

Every generation has a dark period they can vividly recall and narrate
to a future generation, but millennials in Kenya have endured more than
enough. From the HIV-Aids scourge to political upheavals of the 1980s
and 1990s to joblessness occasioned by state-sanctioned graft to the
Covid-19 pandemic, one cannot deny that my generation, the millennials,
somehow arrived on this world at the wrong time.

We are the generation that was born on the advent of the HIV-Aids
pandemic and grew up when the stigma associated with it was more
ravaging than the infection itself. Hundreds lost their breadwinners
-fathers and mothers -and a host of relatives who would have cared for
them once their parents departed. Being orphaned and re-orphaned
condemned dozens to a life of squalor in the streets and slums where
survival for the fittest was the mantra.

One New York-based, direct-to-consumer brand has initiated open dialogue
with its consumers about a loss of revenue and furloughs resulting from
the coronavirus.

Jewelry brand Catbird posted a letter from its founder Rony Vardi on
Instagram last week saying that the company had no choice but to
furlough a majority of its employees. “This is the most difficult moment
this business, built with such care and love, has ever faced. We have
held out for as long as possible, but we have no choice but to
temporarily lay off a portion of our staff until we can reopen,” said
the letter.

2020 MAR 31 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at
China Weekly News -- Investigators publish new report on Science - Earth
Science. According to news reporting from Chongqing, People's Republic
of China, by VerticalNews journalists, research stated, "The stability
of the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) during the early Holocene and
the timing of the Holocene optimum have been intensely debated. Both
stalagmite and lake records from northern China imply that there was a
millennium-scale monsoon weakening event during the early Holocene, but
whether this phenomenon is common across the Asian monsoon region
remains unclear due to a paucity of records from southern China."

Financial supporters for this research include National Key R&D Program
of China, National Natural Science Foundation of China.

On Dec. 20, 2019, Deborah Birx's annual holiday party was in full swing,
and Birx, in a baby-blue Christmas sweater with sequined snowflakes
circling the heads of polar bears, would not stop restocking the bar.
She stood at her white kitchen island, piling bottles of seltzer and
cans of soda into buckets of ice, then cracking open bottles of wine.
"You know, you could hire a *millennial* to do this," I noted. I'd
wedged myself into a corner between the flat-screen TV and Birx's
husband, former Clinton advance man Paige Reffe. The world was simpler
then. The gig economy was in swing, parties were still thrown, and
Birx's current job as the White House coronavirus coordinator didn't yet
exist. She was only the United States global AIDS coordinator, in charge
of the American fight to try to end HIV.

SAN MATEO, Calif., March 31, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- A new national survey
from Swytchback, a leader in mobile visual surveys, found that nearly a
quarter (23%) of Gen Z and *Millennial* respondents consider COVID-19
not at all serious, not very serious or mildly serious, and only about
half (51%) consider it very serious. The survey of more than 20,000 men
and women between the ages of 16 to 30 years old examines young people's
perceptions of and knowledge about COVID-19, and identifies areas for
improved communication and education to help prevent its spread. The
survey was conducted in partnership with Tap Research.

The findings show that many Gen Zers and Millennials continue to have
significant knowledge gaps concerning the coronavirus pandemic. Other
topline findings from the survey include:

There appears to be a pandemic generosity effect. In the last
edition[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/personal-finance/household-finances/article-what-can-financially-secure-people-do-to-help-out-right-now/]
of this newsletter, I asked people who are financially secure in these
uncertain times what ideas they had to help others who are struggling. A
days-long cascade of helpful emails followed. Those with means are ready
to help those in need, if they haven’t already done so.

These ideas are presented as a kind of brainstorm. If you’re in a
position to help out, see if one or two points resonate with you. (Note:
There was some overlap in the ideas. The most commonly suggested points
are up top.)

For every trying moment we experience it seems there is a quip from
Winston Churchill waiting to help us through. As the world faces up to
its frailty in front of a microscopic virus, we must remember to never
let a good crisis go to waste.”

The coronavirus has thrown us into the unknown. In fact, the virus
itself should be called Phenomenon Unknown, for we know so little about
it. We are facing an existential crisis on multiple levels today:
regarding ourselves and what we do with our time, concerning the
foundations our societies and economy are built upon, about our
relationship with the rest of the world and with nature, and, most
importantly, relating to our utter powerlessness in front of this virus.
On every one of these levels we are realizing that we have much to learn
and much to reconsider about the way we as humans have been living.

After the financial crash, Britain’s young shouldered the burden. The
Conservatives must not let that happen again

The kids are boomeranging back again. Up and down the country, overgrown
children are shuffling home to roost, refugees from a virus that has
stalled their adult lives mid-launch. University lectures and
supervisions have all been moved online, so there’s no point student
children moping around deserted halls when they could be home ransacking
the parental
fridge[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/going-home-puts-my-parents-at-risk-students-hit-by-coronavirus-upheaval].
Gap years too are ending abruptly in a mad scrabble for the last flight
out. And for those losing wobbly first jobs in the early wave of
coronavirus redundancies, from bar and shop workers to freelancers whose
commissions have dried up overnight, home is the refuge of last resort.
But now what?

If you thought dating was complicated before, buckle up. Up until

ghosting[https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ghosting],
catfishing[https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/catfishing] and

VANCOUVER—First, the boomers criticized millennials, then the
millennials struck back at boomers. Now, they're both here for Gen Z.

Millennials were once branded as entitled brats who couldn't afford
homes because they dined out on avocado toast. Then the tables turned
and the concerns of aging boomers were dismissed with the flippant “OK
Boomer” meme.

vitro fertilization to try to conceive, with more than 72,000 babies

the lock-down of Lagos, Ogun and Federal Capital Territory, FCT, Abuja
as announced by President Muhammadu Buhari during his broadcast on
Sunday evening to tackle the raging COVID-19 pandemic. No fewer than 13
states are currently observing one form of restriction or the other and
many markets have been closed.

Until recently, Jess Silfa's 96-year-old grandmother was living in a
rehabilitation center in Tampa, recovering from hip surgery. When the
coronavirus started spreading in Florida and around the United States,
Silfa made the difficult decision to pull her grandmother out of the
center, months before the doctor thought she was ready to be discharged.

"I had to make a quick decision," said Silfa, who is disabled and uses a
cane. "I was afraid the virus would run rampant like it did in other
homes in Washington and Illinois."

From plastic-free parenting to 'Everyday Take 20', here are some
parenting trends that may become popular this year, thanks to very
with-it parents, who are being influenced by various global events

While every parent wants to be the best for their children, it's not
easy balancing career and family, juggling responsibilities and managing
the needs of children and self. However, today's parents are more
invested, conscious and savvy about their parenting choices and taking
cues from everyone - environmental activist Greta Thunberg to celebrity
couple Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. Here's a look at the parenting
trends that may pick up momentum this year.

Fashion designer Zeba Sayeed prefers grabbing a bite on the go and
rattling through chores, so she can focus on work. But there’s no going
anywhere now as Bengaluru, along with rest of India, hits pause for
health and safety.Trapped indoors and forced to cook more often — it’s
not a family expectation, she just doesn’t want to order in every day —
Zeba has turned to the pros for inspiration: her mother and grandmother,
who live in Hyderabad. Together, they are reviving old family recipes
with the help of video calls, which have shrunk the distance between the
country’s two tech hubs. Similar scenes are unfolding in many other
kitchens as millennials, female and male, look to learn the basics or
upgrade their culinary skills.“Initially, after the lockdown was
announced, I was googling simple recipes for fluffy pancakes and fish
curries.

India, March 30 -- We live in the most amazing times -- human race has
never been this still, at least in the last 50 years, yet nature is
rebooting itself. With the current lockdown in place due to the spread
of Covid-19, people have been forced to stay indoors. On popular demand,
hit TV mythological serial from 1980s, Ramayan, is back on Indian
television. Close on heels would be Mahabharat and Shah Rukh Khan's
Circus and Rajit Kapur's Byomkesh Bakshi.

So, here's a wishlist of serials from Indian television's golden era we
would love to watch all over again.

Last November, when my now-husband and I got married, we registered for
contributions to our honeymoon. “Where are you going?” everyone wanted
to know. We didn’t have an answer. Between all the time, money and
energy that went into the ceremony and reception, travel plans were on
the back burner. And we’re not alone. Once again, the definition of a
“honeymoon” seems to be changing.

The word “honeymoon” dates to the fifth century, when wedded couples
would drink mead (sweet wine) during the first month, or moon, of
marriage. In Victorian England, it meant visiting family and friends who
couldn’t attend the wedding. Only later would the meaning evolve into a
romantic holiday for two.

With the workforce increasingly becoming younger, millennials are
transforming the way business is being conducted. Their familiarity with
the internet and mobile technology is driving a wave of consumerism that
enables them to purchase just about anything with a few swipes and
clicks. Everything from ride-shares to movies to food deliveries are
increasingly getting transacted online. Purchasing health care is no
different. Organizations are rethinking how they offer such benefits
because employees are demanding new options. This market shift is
igniting new health care and benefits programs.

The biggest hit to the global economy comes not from the virus itself
but from the escalating restrictive movement measures imposed by
governments. “Social distancing” is probably among the most repeated
phrases these days, along with “stay at home” and “shelter in place”,
and words such as “quarantine” and “lockdown”.

Many market observers are fretting over a global recession or, worse,
depression. Certainly, upcoming economic indicators will be very, very
bad, but not very meaningful in the current environment.

Corona could hardly be more timely as director Mostafa Keshvari touts
his trapped-in-an-elevator drama as the first COVID-19 movie of the
coronavirus era.

"The idea came to me when I was in an elevator reading news about
Chinese tourists being attacked, and I thought I'm going to make a movie
in an elevator," Keshvari tells The Hollywood Reporter on Monday. The
thriller, shot on a soundstage in Vancouver and already edited and ready
for sale, uses the coronavirus pandemic, which originated in China, as a
symbol to explore fear and racism among trapped apartment tenants.

So you want to start a podcast.

Like blogs and social media, podcasts are democratizing the way people
share their thoughts with the world, with the episodic audio series
continuing to gain traction with listeners seeking both entertainment
value and educational dialogue. The latest Nielsen stats show that half
of all U.S. households consider themselves to be fans of at least one
podcast, with 22% of these people identifying as “avid fans.”

Global Warming Focus -- Researchers detail new data in Science - Climate
Research. According to news reporting originating from Beijing, People's
Republic of China, by VerticalNews correspondents, research stated,
"Tree growth trends can affect the interpretation of the response of
tree-ring proxies (especially tree-ring width) to climate in the
low-frequency band, which in turn may limit quantitative understanding
of centennial-scale climate variability. As such, it is difficult to
determine if long-term trends in tree-ring measurements are caused by
age-dependent growth effects or climate."

In order to promote health and safety guidelines in the wake of the
novel coronavirus, Freeform is launching a multi-platform social
distancing campaign called #StayTheFFHome, Variety has learned exclusively.

The goal of #StayTheFFHome is to encourage the Freeform audience to take
state officials’ “safer at home” and “shelter in place” advisories
seriously. To further entice young adults to hunker down wherever they
dwell, Freeform has put together a special programming lineup to give
them something to binge and will be running special PSAs on-air and
across social media in which talent from the network’s shows talks about
the importance of social distancing and flattening the curve.
Additionally, Freeform will be branding billboards and other outdoor
posters with the logo for the campaign.

A week or so ago a video came out where a bunch of Hollywood celebs
marked the global COVID-19 pandemic by forlornly singing John Lennon’s
“Imagine”.

As they crooned the lyrics “imagine no possessions” from their Beverly
Hills mansions, temperatures around the world shot up, and it wasn’t
because we were infected with coronavirus. We were infected with
seething jealousy that these sad-faced A-listers were seeming to bemoan
their quarantine days in the lap of luxury, while many of us were
bouncing off the walls in a dwelling smaller than Natalie Portman’s
bathroom.

Canadian postsecondary students are weeks away from stepping into a job
market that is reeling from unprecedented layoffs, raising concern about
how those returning to school in the fall will fund their studies and
whether graduates will bear long-term scars of unfortunate timing.

Just weeks ago, the outlook was favourable. At 5.6 per cent, the
national unemployment rate in February was close to a record low and
companies were struggling to find workers.

* When my husband and I learned we'd be getting a $3,900 stimulus check
for our family of five, we talked a lot about what to do with it.

* It won't cover one month of expenses for our family, so we decided
it's not worth saving. It won't do much to reduce our student loan debt
either, so we're going to spend it to stimulate our local economy.

More than 300 Iranians died as a result of bad information. Not the
coronavirus that spreads all over the world. They consumed methanol
believing that they could eliminate the ills caused by COVID-19 and heal
for good. They had read it on some social networks and instant messaging
chains. Desperate, they ingested it. Such beliefs are not unique to that
country and, similarly, spread throughout the world. Coffee, tea, soups
and other infusions would be ideal for combating the malignant strain
that dies at a certain amount of degrees Celsius. *Millennial*
concoctions are also promoted, some than other potions and even swimming

For centuries man needed the fantastic. And I don't mean stories like
Edgar Allan Poe or Ray Bradbury or Cervantes himself with his wandering
knight. It is not difficult to observe that, for humans, everything that
is inexplicable has such a powerful force as an indicator of our weakness.

Do we want to treasure unpublished resources? We need to warn that it's
more what we don't know than we know? It's likely.

Making $90,000 a year as a marketing manager, living in the downtown
core and finally debt-free, Marwa finally has the life she's always
dreamed of. But at 31, she's going through a “mid-life crisis,” and
unsure of what she should be saving for.

“I am at a bit of a standstill when it comes to setting up my future
life goals, so, I don't really have any,” she writes into *Millennial*
Money[https://www.thestar.com/business/millennialmoney.html]. She's
hoping that this exercise and the advice from her coach will give her
the confidence she needs to pursue her next steps.

I have seen countless tweets, erroneous news articles and opinion pieces
over the past week or so calling out millennials for exacerbating the
spread of coronavirus with their youthful ignorance and wayward spring
break partying. As a *millennial*, I found the claims to be pretty
unsettling. So I thought we should have a talk.
