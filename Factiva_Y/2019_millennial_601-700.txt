Brands are turning up the pitch on voter participation, targeting
*millennial* consumers in their fold

Within days of the poll dates being announced for the 2019 Lok Sabha,
the iconic Amul girl was on hoardings inking her finger, exhorting
voters to turn up at the booth. The tagline read: ‘Pollitical Spectacle!
Amul-Prime Candidate’. Automotive lubricants maker Castrol leapt in with
its own message, #NonStopDemocracy, asking young bikers to become
ambassadors for the vote. And Wipro-owned soap brand Santoor intertwined
its promise of ‘youthful skin’ with the social responsibility of casting
one’s vote.

A SOUTH Australian entrepreneur is selling “outback air” to China. Joe
Duchiera, from Croydon Park is about to release his product, Ozi Air, to
customers from China.

The 36-year-old has poured hundreds of thousands of dollars of his own
money into his business dream of selling pure SA outback air in a can.

MOST big dreams, from footy to cricket to wrestling, begin in the
classic Aussie backyard.

This weekend, when promoters Sean Rault, Corey Topp and Mark Middo host
their Reminisce event for up to 10,000 punters at the Sidney Myer Music
Bowl, it will be hard to forget the humble Frankston patch where it all
started.

ON A grey snowy day in Toronto I enter a nondescript warehouse off a
bleak highway. I’m here to see how work on What We Do In The Shadows,
the US TV version of the popular Kiwi mockumentary, is going.

They’re nearing the end of a breakneck shoot in the middle of a freezing
Toronto winter. Because of the subject matter the filming happens at
night ensuring the cast and crew have literally turned into vampires
during the making of this show.

Hyman Minsky would have had a field day with last week’s US inflation
numbers.

One of the key points in the late, great economist’s Financial
Instability Hypothesis was that there are two kinds of prices — prices
for goods and services, and asset prices. Inflation in the two areas
should, as a result, differ.

It's normally a healthy mix of fund managers, banking executives and
tech entrepreneurs who make up the typical demographic in the most
affluent pockets of Sydney's eastern suburbs.

But in the case of Hermit Bay, the prestigious harbourfront enclave of
Vaucluse, the small group of home owners are almost exclusively those
who have made their fortunes from property in one way or another.

Ignoring the energy transition is a threat to the climate, but will also
undermine the ability of companies to hire the best talent and attract
future clients, argues Helene Egebøl, CEO of Schneider Electric Denmark

Prague is the number two city in Europe for factors likely to attract
millennials interested in living abroad, according to a
study[https://www.nimblefins.co.uk/top-5-european-cities-millenials] by
personal finance research site NimbleFins – which is, ironically, based
in the UK, currently teetering on the brink of leaving the EU.

Taking second place only to Zurich in Switzerland (the study covered 24
cities, including some outside the EU and EFTA), Prague was the
highest-ranked city in TOL's region, with the next-highest, Zagreb, at
14th, Budapest at 16th, Warsaw at 17th, and Belgrade at 23th.

The denim company’s brand has proved tough enough to survive years of
wear and tear

Levi Strauss last went public nearly half a century ago, when the San
Francisco-based denim jeans company launched an initial public offering
in 1971. Both blue jeans and Levi Strauss have had plenty of ups and
downs since then, but the company is venturing out again.

In February, Reactions Editor-in-Chief Shawn Moynihan hosted a
roundtable of re/insurance professionals spanning the spectrum of the
industry to address the elephant in the room for Property & Casualty
organisations: the continued loss of institutional knowledge from the
industry, and the challenge of attracting, cultivating and retaining new
talent to replenish its ranks.

What follows is an edited transcript of that conversation, in which our
participants weighed in on strategies for recruitment, creating the type
of culture that appeals to junior talent, and what needs to be done to
drive more fresh insight to a career in re/insurance, among other topics.

MAHER AL-HAFFAR, EXECUTIVE VP OF IR, CORPORATE COMMUNICATIONS & PUBLIC
AFFAIRS, CEMEX, S.A.B. DE C.V.: Good morning, I'm Maher Al-Haffar,
Executive Vice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Communications
and Public affairs for CEMEX. First, whether you're here with us in New
York or are online, I want to thank you on behalf of my colleagues for
joining us today. Now you may not know that today is the International
Day of Happiness. This is actually an event that is being promoted by
the United Nations. And some of you may think that we actually arranged
CEMEX Day today because of that. And yesterday by, the way, was my
birthday, not to mention it or anything, but so it all has to do with a
little bit of happiness here.

A few minutes before announcing that he crossed the 65,000 unique
donation threshold necessary to qualify for the first two Democratic
debates, 2020 longshot candidate Andrew Yang tweeted that he thought
Nicolas Cage may have sent some money his way. Late last week, I
confirmed with Cage’s manager that Cage does indeed support Yang’s bid
for the Oval Office. In the days since I tweeted the news, I’ve been
flooded with notifications from members of the #YangGang, an inscrutable
online contingent of supporters who love Yang’s keystone promise to give
every American adult $1,000 per month. It remains unclear whether the
#YangGang’s meme-heavy campaign to put Yang front and center in the
Democratic primary race is sincere or an elaborate troll.

year in North York.

Kimberley Bulletin -- As a Member of Parliament, I represent people in
all stages of life and think it's important to consider the impact of
government policies and investments across age brackets. As a parent and
grandparent, I hope my children and granddaughter will have the same
opportunities and quality of life I have been fortunate to have.

Unfortunately, young Canadians are graduating school with record amounts
of student debt only to be faced with precarious work, stagnant wages,
and rising housing costs. Many are worried about how they will reach
milestones like buying a home, starting a family, or retiring. Those who
do have children encounter the added burden of astronomical childcare
costs. One of my *millennial* staff members explains the situation
facing her generation saying, "Canada is eating its young."

At a party at her Arizona home in 1981, a middle-aged Sandra Day
O'Connor, ever the consummate hostess, served enchiladas poolside with
good cheer. But when she greeted a friend of her son who was soon to
begin a clerkship for Supreme Court Justice William Rehnquist, her mood
shifted. As Evan Thomas describes the scene in "First," his illuminating
and eminently readable biography of the Supreme Court's first female
justice, O'Connor "conveyed an almost palpable sense of longing" for
past opportunities denied her because of gender. With her appointment to
the court weeks away, she launched into a stream-of-consciousness
monologue about her envy decades earlier when Rehnquist, her Stanford
Law School classmate (and former beau), had started his clerkship at the
court, a steppingstone at that time reserved almost exclusively for men.

WASHINGTON – Luke Robbins couldn't hold back the tears when he
introduced South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg as a featured speaker at the
College Democrats of America's 2018 convention.

Robbins told the gathering that Buttigieg's 2015 public essay, "Why
Coming out Matters," helped persuade him – a gay teen from a
conservative Indiana family – to come out. It showed him that doing so
wouldn't mean giving up his love of politics.

doing business with Europe increased 24% between 2017 and 2018.

Arrivals from Europe to the GCC will increase 29% over the period 2018
to 2023, driven by new and direct flight routes, a growing number of
*millennial* and middle-class travellers and competitive air fares,
according to the latest data released ahead of Arabian Travel Market
(ATM) 2019, which takes place at Dubai World Trade Centre from 28 April
- 1 May 2019.

Extended TV coverage of election day may become deflating, as the
growing trend of pre-polling and postal votes slows down the count and
means a winner may not be picked on the night.

In 2007, 8.22 per cent of voters pre-polled nationwide, compared with
22.67 per cent at the 2016 federal election.

The new federal budget includes a plan for Canada's housing agency to
offer interest-free loans to first-time homebuyers, but mortgage
brokers, real estate agents and economists say it will do little to get
millennials into the housing market.

Through the First Time Home Buyer Incentive, the Canada Mortgage and
Housing Corp. will provide up to 10 per cent funding for mortgages on
new builds and up to five per cent on existing homes.

OTTAWA/TORONTO, March 20 (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau remained under pressure over a corruption scandal on Wednesday
as a legislator quit his party's caucus and a pre-election budget aimed
at swaying key voters appeared to offer too little to stem the tide of
negative news.

The budget - the last before federal elections in October - lavished new
spending on middle-class voters but ignored corporations. It also
provided a little for key groups such as *millennial* voters who backed
Trudeau in droves in Canada's 2015 election.

Edmonton community leaders shared mixed reactions to the different
funding and program incentives announced with the tabling of the 2019
federal budget Tuesday.

Edmonton Mill Woods MP Amarjeet Sohi said the budget, titled Investing
in the Middle Class, will help to ease the middle class'anxieties with
the introduction of a 10-per-cent mortgage loan for first-time
homebuyers making less than $120,000 a year.

As expected, Canada is going to pot.

Marijuana use has risen in the country since legalization, according to
a new study from Western Canadian research company Insights West, which
shows that nearly a quarter of adult Canadians consumed cannabis in the
last few months of 2018.

The way we work is evolving as we continue to add more generations to
the workforce. In order to stay competitive in this new workforce and
attract and maintain the appropriate talent, companies are performing
extensive research to understand and adapt. “It’s important to track
millennials as a workforce because today they constitute 38 percent of
the workforce—and this will grow to 75 per- cent by 2025.” (McGrady, 2016)1

The business section of a well-known Canadian newspaper warned the other
day that any forecasts contained in the federal budget should be treated
with extreme caution(
https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-how-serially-bad-private-sector-economic-forecasts-could-hurt-bill/[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-how-serially-bad-private-sector-economic-forecasts-could-hurt-bill/]
), given the fact economists have a lengthy record of getting their
predictions seriously wrong.

Most economists have no more clue what's going to happen down the road
than you or I, because they have no way of telling which of the 7
gazillion influences they're aware of may come into play, not to mention
any unknown factors, which are hard to identify, because they're unknown.

TRENDS Bodega Rita's is the new NY-style sandwich joint by power couple
Gabriel Pryce and Missy Flynn. Samuel Fishwick meets them

MAN cannot live on on bread alone but if he had to, Bodega Rita's would
be where he'd make a beeline. The tiny deli in Coal Drops Yard serves
more hunky snacks than a Magic Mike XXL calendar: the Tony, a thiccboi
stuffed with salami, prosciutto, pesto, smoked cheddar and lashings of
mayo; the Baba, a sourdough doorstopper overflowing with cucumber,
pickles, tomato oil and spicy roast pepper ajvar relish (a gloriously
orange Balkan condiment); the King Banh Mi, a moistmaker dripping with
roast oyster mushrooms, peanut butter, carrot, daikon and pickle,
coriander and mint.

NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / March 20, 2019 / Despite the occasional
market disruptions, luxury has never lost its allure, and few products
accentuate social status and personal style to the degree a fine
timepiece does. One noteworthy development in this highly traditional
industry is its growing openness to a relatively recent phenomenon: the
boom in demand for luxury pre-owned and unworn
watches[http://pr.report/rp-Tf9OQ]. Largely driven by the *Millennial*
generation, unique and vintage products are enjoying a revival, while
digital stores and social media platforms are enabling brands to reach
younger buyers.

women in “midlife,” with medications to treat some of the symptoms of

investors, General Catalyst. (Forbes Media has an investment in Ro.)
Despite growing up around a gynecologist—her father—Blank says she had
been experiencing symptoms of a hormonal condition called polycystic
ovary syndrome for years before she was diagnosed at age 22.

since its first seasonal launch back in January 2015 consist of young
people. These are often millennials who are attracted to the program
because they are seeking a unique work/travel experience that enables
them to find a job, gain new work skills and have an adventure of a
lifetime.

Gary Howe, United Steelworkers Local 1005 union president, knew the
federal budget wasn't going to satisfy labour's call for company pension
protections. But he is still disappointed.

"We were told they weren't going to do anything," he said. "I wasn't
expecting anything in this budget to put pensions first in bankruptcies
(but) we're still going to push for it."

Long yellow dresses were the hit of the spring catwalks. Now, from the
red carpet to the high street, they look set to last the summer

There is only one way to make an entrance this spring, and that is in a
yellow maxi. That’s right – maxi, not taxi. What you are looking for is
a new-season dress, in supersized sunshine.

A little-known element of President Donald Trump’s 2020 budget proposal
may be among its most important: $1 billion for child-care providers and
new incentives for paid family leave.

Great challenges, such as wars and disasters, are plain to see and spur
us into action as a nation. Others, such as the devastating opioid
crisis, sneak up on us slowly, like the proverbial frog in gradually
heating water — we might not notice how dire our situation is until it’s
too late.

When cleancult Co-Founder Ryan Lupberger looked at other brands of
cleaning products, he noted that the same problems always appeared to
arise even with better-for-the-world offerings. They used really heavy
plastic packaging, Lupberger told PYMNTS in an interview, adding he also
didnt understand their ingredient lists. At the same time, he said, no
brand has come at this from an online perspective through new branding
and distribution online. Today, his company sells green eco-friendly
cleaning products on its direct-to-consumer (D2C) website through
starter kits and recurring refills.

Mumbai, March 20 -- With general elections in India just around the
corner, the debate on employment growth is reaching fever pitch. In the
absence of regular and credible employment statistics, perceptions about
job creation will be critical for the election outcome. Among the urban
youth at least, these perceptions may be changing but the majority
remain concerned about jobs.

According to survey data collected by market researcher YouGov in
collaboration with Mint, more urban youth believe it is easier to find a
job now compared to six months ago. About 43% of the Gen-Z (19- to
22-year-olds) and 45% of younger millennials (23- to 29-year-olds) think
it is "somewhat" to "extremely" easy to find a job nowadays.

India, March 20 -- The learning and development process of the Gen Z is
undergoing massive changes with the advent of technology. The education
system, by fueling the evolution of teaching methods and tools used in
the classroom has been driven by the demands of the digital natives,
whose lives revolve around digital screens and connected devices.
Devices like PCs, laptops and printers have become the functional
extension of this generation, at school as well as home.

Social events like mixers and parties could be a good way for credit
unions to attract young couples unsure about how to apply for their
first mortgage.

A few credit unions have already taken this route with some success,
especially in targeting millennials. Many in this age group are now
buying their initial homes, and social events are a relaxing and
comfortable way for them to learn the nuts and bolts of the mortgage
process.

Staring across the table at a bloodthirsty opposition and an
increasingly skeptical electorate, Finance Minister Bill Morneau has
decided to go all in.

Morneau's fourth budget — and the last before a fall federal election —
eschewed austerity and deficit control in favour of more than $20
billion in new program spending to create more affordable housing,
extend more money for skills training, expand drug coverage, enhance
high-speed internet, provide income boosts for seniors and improve
living conditions for Indigenous Peoples.

India, March 20 -- Comedian Hasan Minhaj has shared an out-take from the
latest episode of his hit Netflix show, Patriot Act. In the clip, Hasan
tests Congress party leader Shashi Tharoor's knowledge in the
*millennial* vocabulary, in which he fails spectacularly.

Shashi Tharoor is famous on internet for his impressive vocabulary .
"You seem to know a lot of words, I wanna test you of how deep your
vocabulary is," Hasan tells the Congress member in the video. He goes on
to spell and pronounce the choicest of words from the *millennial*
lingo, asking the politician to define them but he is left stumped.

The roots of the luxury watch industry run deep -- back hundreds of
years -- and most brands today lean heavily on that heritage, believing
that it gives their products a special appeal and legitimacy.

Current lines are dominated by what the industry calls
''vintage-inspired'' designs, often supported by archive stories linking
products to historic events, like the Omega Speedmaster Professional
that Buzz Aldrin wore on the Moon 50 years ago.

GENEVA -- In his business manual ''Relationology,'' the author and
international speaker Matt Bird wrote that ''the true currency of
business is relationships, not money.'' It's a slogan the new generation
of watch chief executives seem to have taken to heart.

For example, Louis Ferla, the 44-year-old chief executive of Vacheron
Constantin said, ''Of course, success is financial, but there is also
human success,'' he said. ''Watches are the fruits of a human adventure
-- so it's about the human touch.''

If Prime Minister Justin Trudeau walked into Timothy's Pub, he could
count on a greeting with handshakes and the offer of a cold one.

But on the budget and a lot of other things, he would get an earful.

Spending on luxury goods in mainland China is expected to increase by 10
per cent in 2019, slowing from the 20 per cent recorded in the previous
two years, according to a report on the country's market for such items
by global consultancy Bain & Company.

A slowing economy has affected people's incomes and personal wealth,
which will deter China's affluent classes from buying luxury items, said
Bruno Lannes, a partner at Bain.

Four middle-aged, middle-class mothers tried to make a sex film that was
suitable for their *millennial* offspring. It was extraordinary, one
tells Hilary Rose

There are many ways for mothers to deal with empty-nest syndrome.
Directing a porn film for your children seems like one of the more
extreme. Yet that is what Emma, a middle-class mum from west London, has
done. She declines to give her surname, but sitting in her immaculate
kitchen over tea and biscuits, she explains that, with her daughters
aged 18 and 20, she was grieving not to be a mother of little ones any more.

New Delhi, March 20 -- Xiaomi Corp., the largest smartphone seller in
India, is trying to transform itself into the country's "coolest tech
brand" and eventually becoming a household name across technology
segments. "I really hope we morph into something bigger than a
smartphone company," Manu Jain, vice-president at Xiaomi Corp. and
managing director of Xiaomi India, said in an interview.

"We don't want to be a smartphone brand or a consumer durable brand. We
want to be the coolest technology brand in India...it could be in any
space. We want to build a brand that becomes a household name whenever
you think of technology. It's not an easy journey. And it will not
happen in the next two years. It will probably take five years, 10 years
for us to achieve that. And we are here for the next 100 years," he said.

New Delhi, March 20 -- Millennials in rural India could influence $220
billion worth of annual spending, with over $177 billion of this in
discretionary expenditure, as migration to urban areas and the internet
fuel their aspirations, according to researcher Kantar IMRB and Dialogue
Factory.

India is home to the world's largest population of millennials-typically
defined as those aged 18-35. At 450 million, these millennials are
influencing the way Indians eat, shop, commute and buy, much like their
global counterparts.

Stick with me — there’s an upside to this for us all

It is often said that, in a democracy, voters get the government they
deserve. Tinkering with that slightly, there is also a case to be made
that, from time to time, we get the government we need.

The surge in funky super funds catering to the perceived desires of
millennials should be a worrying phenomenon for anyone, like me, who has
*millennial*-aged children.

The promoters of the funds tend to be millennials themselves; those aged
up to 35.

Having dressed the offspring of A-listers such as Cate Blanchett, this
local designer is turning her talents to luxe accessories What I love
about these bags is that they are so *millennial* but can also be worn
by an 80-year-old

If you thought you knew all there was to know about handbags, Elizabeth
O’Connor-Cowley can tell you more. And given that accessories represent
an exciting new chapter in her design journey, the 47-year-old artist
and fashion creative is keen to share her passion with the world.

brands and indies have been giving major international players a run for
their money

As an increasingly informed consumer base switches to younger, digitally
native and locally tailored brands, the landscape in the GCC is
shifting, and this is eating into the market share of traditional
players, especially in the prestige segment. Certain consumers, feeling
the pinch of reduced purchasing power, are also switching to mass and
masstige brands, which are growing their presence on the market.
