As American Beauty approaches its 20th anniversary later this year, star
Thora Birch is hoping that audiences are able to separate allegations of
sexual misconduct made against co-star Kevin Spacey from the film, and
continue to appreciate it on its own terms.

"You can't help but feel, 'great, now we have this stain on the film,'"
Birch said of the #MeToo
allegations[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/kevin-spacey-charged-felony-sexual-assault-1171597]
leveled at Spacey on The Hollywood Reporter's It Happened in Hollywood
podcast[http://You]. "But no — it shouldn't be on the film. Who's to
blame? It's Kevin. It doesn't have anything to do with American Beauty."

The last place you go for money to pay debts or an emergency expense
should be your registered retirement savings plan. You’re going to need
that money to live on after you retire.

But the results of Bank of Montreal’s latest annual RRSP study found
that 34 per cent of RRSP-holders had withdrawn money before the age of
71. At the end of the year you turn 71, you have to convert an RRSP into
a registered retirement income fund, or RRIF.

The workforce is encountering a significant shift. Millennials are
expected to make up 75 percent of the workforce by 2025. This
generation, also known as Generation Y, is known for several
characteristics that companies can harness, including being confident,
open-minded, team-oriented and technologically advanced. While there are
characteristics associated with every generation, it's important to note
that these are generational differences and not generalizations of
personality. So, what do business leaders need to know about
Millennials' work style preferences to utilize them effectively?

-Women can't 'mess up' with a Valentine's Day gift that solves those
whisker woes-

STERLING, Ill., Jan. 29, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Maybe it's the follicular
pheromones, or the fuzzy feel, but one thing is certain -- women love
men with beards. In fact, research has revealed the majority of U.S.
women prefer a man with facial hair over a clean-shaven face. Something
women don't love, however, is the mess a neatly groomed beard can leave
behind. So just in time for Valentine's Day, men's grooming leader Wahl
is coming to the rescue with the new Wahl Lithium Ion Vacuum Trimmer --
a gift he'll want and she'll praise.

How wellness upstarts spoiled milk’s healthy reputation – and built a
billion-dollar industry from juicing oats and nuts. By Oliver
Franklin-Wallis

In the spring of 2018, New York was gripped by a sudden, very particular
and, for some, calamitous food shortage. Gaps appeared on grocery
shelves. Coffee shops put out signs, turning customers away. Twitter and
Instagram brimmed with outrage. The truly desperate searched from
Williamsburg to Harlem, but it seemed undeniable: New York was out of
oat milk.

After one month, three cities and hundreds of shows, the trends for
autumn are in. Here is a breakdown of what happened – and what it means
for your autumn wardrobe

The autumn/winter 2019 menswear shows were full of comebacks and firsts.
Milan hosted blockbuster shows from Prada, Versace and even Dolce &
Gabbana, treading carefully after last year’s China racism row. Paris
was packed and cold, but saw universally successful debuts from Hedi
Slimane at Celine, Jonathan Anderson at Loewe and Clare Waight Keller at
Givenchy. Craig Green returned to the London schedule alongside Charles
Jeffrey Loverboy, who had a plaid party in a warehouse, and
A-Cold-Wall*, which put a doberman on the catwalk. Scarves were long,
bags were big and for the first time in four seasons, tailoring
triumphed over tracksuits. Here are the other trends we can expect to
see next autumn.

New Delhi, Jan 29 (IANS) Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, during his visit to
India in November last year, was seen showing off a tattoo on his left
hand to Congress President Rahul Gandhi as he discussed with him some of
the steps being taken to sanitise his platform in the country.

Despite the bonhomie and some great snaps during the India visit, the
ground reality is that there is no India head at Twitter for a couple of
months now as the country faces general election, amid the growing
debate over the spread of misinformation, hate, abuse and fake news on
various social media platforms, including Twitter.

has replaced the fear of missing out (

increasingly happy to stay at home and save
money[https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/money], new research finds.

Shares in PZ Cussons have lost their lather after the maker of Imperial
Leather soap and Original Source shower gel warned that annual profits
will be £10m lower after "extremely challenging" conditions in Nigeria,
its largest market.

Analysts speculated that the ongoing troubles of the Nigerian division
means it could be sold after the company said it had approved "strategic
initiatives" to focus on its European and Asian business.

*HD* 	This Week in Comcast: Why capital spending is down despite net

Another jump in broadband subscribers gave Comcast CEO Brian Roberts a
lot to boast about in last week’s Q4 and full year 2018 earnings
call[https://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/news/2019/01/23/cmcsa-comcast-nbc-streaming-sky-tv-show-rights.html],
as the Philadelphia-based media giant’s “connectivity-centric model"
continues to pay off.

Driving that success is a larger profit margin in broadband compared to
video, which comes with programming costs, along with Comcast dialing
down capital spending in its cable division. In 2018, the company spent
3 percent less, or $7.7 billion. When viewed as a percentage of
Comcast’s revenue, or capital expenditure intensity, spending dropped 1
percent in the past year – a trend the company expects to continue into
2019.

DORIT Ungar Black, the founding partner of Holwell Shuster & Goldberg,
calls it the summer of hell. The babysitter was supposed to be waiting
for Liam, 5, and Sivan, 3, when the bus brought them home from summer
camp. But instead, the place was deserted. "That was not a pleasant call
to get," she said.

Another babysitter ignored her calls and texts, so Black and her
lawyer-husband, Barry Black, who has his own firm, Nelson Madden Black,
raced home on the train to Westchester to be sure the children wouldn't
be returning to an empty house.

Joelle Farrow's travel-weary body might have preferred a soft hotel bed.
But her money-conscious mind had other ideas.

So she dropped her backpack on the floor for a pillow and curled up in a
corner at one of Tokyo's airports to wait out the 11-hour delay of her
flight home to Toronto. Sacrificing comfort, she figures, saved her well
over $100.

One of the trends of 2019, according to the searches of users of social
networks, especially those identified between 18 and 35 years, is the
fact of wanting to learn to cook.

The books of recipes in the twentieth century were tacitly or directly
directed towards a stereotype of a woman who manages the home and who,
therefore, is in charge of what is consumed within a domestic unit. At
some point it was documented that with the greater integration of women
into the labor market since the 1960s in different countries, the
culinary tasks at home had to be simplified and the kitchen became an
activity to which fewer hours were devoted in the distribution of daily

Shut out of the global financial system, Iran is inching closer to a
workaround to US sanctions with the possible unveiling of its first
state-backed cryptocurrency in the near future.

The virtual currency is anticipated to be announced at the annual
two-day Electronic Banking and Payment Systems conference, which kicks
off on January 29 in the capital, Tehran. The theme of this year`s
gathering is "blockchain revolution".

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a new invitation to President Donald
Trump to give his State of the Union speech on Feb. 5.

The formal letter Monday suggests Trump will reschedule the speech after
it was postponed because of the partial government shutdown. Trump and
Congress reached a deal Friday to reopen the government, which had been
Pelosi's condition for allowing Trump to speak.

Bangladesh, Jan. 29 -- Although banks and financial institutions are the
late embracers of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the banking industry has
seen a massive change in the past decade due to the revolutions of AI.
Banks are axing the number of physical branches while investing highly
in innovations. Spanish-owned bank Santander announced on January 23
that it would close down more than 140 branches across the UK putting
1270 jobs at risk. [The first banks will close on April 25 with the
latest shutting shop on December 12.] AI is completely reshaping the way
people expect banks to give them full freedom and peace of mind. AI can
take care of the repetitive tasks that most of the bankers do at work
every day and give them the scope to focus on something more creative.
AI and Machine Learning (ML) can provide the following services to the
bank consumers:

New York has no shortage of beer. So why did a busload of New Yorkers
cross the border to visit a tiny brewery in the town of Bayfield, Ont.?
It wasn't just for the superior suds. They came to see its zero-waste
brewing process.

River Road Brewing opened in April, but word of mouth is already drawing
visitors from across Ontario, Quebec and the northeastern United States.
The innovative brewery is just one of the socially conscious businesses
springing up in Ontario's Huron County. The region has become an
unexpected nexus for social enterprise, a business model that makes the
world better.

WASHINGTON -- The five-week federal government shutdown took a
significant economic toll, costing the United States economy $11
billion, with nearly a quarter of that total permanently lost, the
Congressional Budget Office said on Monday.

The figures are the first official projection of the economic effects of
the longest federal shutdown in history, and they show that its cost was
nearly double the $5.7 billion request by President Trump for a border
wall that fueled the impasse. That is enough to reduce first-quarter
growth by about 0.4 percentage points.

The solution is to simplify complex, contradictory and hostile work and
personal environments.

In a popular BuzzFeed
article[https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/millennials-burnout-generation-debt-work],
Anne Helen Petersen describes how millennials (people born between 1981
and
1996[http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/01/17/where-millennials-end-and-generation-z-begins/])
became “the burnout generation”. She describes some of the stark
consequences of edging towards burnout and identifies what she calls
“errand paralysis”, marked by a struggle to do even simple or mundane tasks.

Walking to Holyrood the other day to interview a politician, I bumped
into a pal. She asked me who I was going to see. Patrick Harvie, I
replied, leader of the Scottish Greens.

"Are you going to apologise to him?" she asked. That threw me. "Why
should I apologise to him?" I said. "Because of the unkind things you
said about him in The Times during the last general election," she replied.

JAKARTA (THE JAKARTA POST/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - Making up nearly half of
the electorate, Indonesia's millennials are at the top of every
political party's target group list for this year's election.

But the younger generation's general disinterest in politics, coupled
with a decreasing turnout rate, raises the question of whether
candidates and political parties will be able to get millennials to
exercise their right to vote at all come election day in April.

The word “*millennial*” brings to mind the image of Mark Zuckerberg in a
hoodie on the verge of making his Facebook move and Snapchat creator
Evan Spiegel teaching the world the disappearing act.

This is the crowd that toggles. They toggle between Snapchat and
Instagram. They toggle between streaming services and gaming. They
toggle between their passion projects and broadcasting every minute of
the day (wardrobe to food choices). The youngest members of this
demographic, in fact, would not remember a time before social media.

Faber Group.One Faber, which operates a cable car network in Singapore
and is the country’s key lifestyle services brand, expects a strong
surge from India."More airports mean more opportunities to target

airports over the next decade, the Indian tourism market is expected to
grow exponentially, especially with the *millennial* market," Mount
Faber Leisure Group Director (Sales and Business Development) Patrick
Lee said.Increasing flight connectivity between India and Singapore will
aid the numbers. “India's tourist arrivals to Singapore are growing from
strength to strength. We hope to see a rapid increase in Indians

As the country enters its demographic bonus period, several of President
Joko "Jokowi" Widodo's Cabinet members are seeing their popularity grow
among millennials.

Indonesian millennials, the generation of people aged 20 to 34 years
old, are estimated to number 65.9 million in 2019, making up nearly a
quarter of the country's population of 266 million, according to
Statistics Indonesia.

*HD* 	‘The Image Book’ Review: Godard Looks at Violence, and Movies;
Critic’s Pick

To borrow an idiom from the extremely online, late Godard is a mood.
Inscrutable, stubborn and pessimistic; preoccupied with historical
traumas, dead writers and old movies; and yet, in spite of what looks
like nostalgia and sounds like fatigue, unmistakably — defiantly —
present, alive and engaged.

That said, I don’t think I’m alone among Jean-Luc Godard completists in
finding that my admiration (or tolerance) for a given film depends a lot
on my own mood at the time of viewing. For the past 20 years or so, the
movies themselves have been consistent in their themes, attitudes and
rhythms, but sometimes I’m unable to shake myself out of my sunny,
shallow, American mental habits and succumb to the master’s gloomy
Gallic wit and intellectual intransigence.

The popularity of boho fashion has ebbed and flowed since the 90s but it
always makes a reappearance during festival season.

Coachella, which recently released this year’s line-up, is a mecca for
boho style and closer to home, summer outdoor festivals always seem to
unleash the inner bohemian, with plenty of fringe, tassels and tribal
prints to be seen.

A White Paper by Brent Lee, MD, MPH, Director of Clinical Excellence and
Performance Improvement for North American Partners in Anesthesia
(NAPA), describes the implications of a statistical study for hospital
loyalty and revenue, and how data inspired a new pathway to optimal
patient outcomes.

Trade imbalance, if left uncorrected, might have damaging long-term
effects on continent's development and industrialization

In 2010, as a fresh graduate from high-school, I made the decision to
study Mandarin while at Yale University. I made this decision because I
realized that many of the electronic devices my family purchased from
Accra's markets came with Chinese manuals no one could understand.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the freshman New York representative, joins
Intercept reporters Ryan Grim and Briahna Joy Gray for an in-depth
conversation about her approach to politics and social media, her
thoughts on the 2020 presidential election, and her out-of-nowhere
congressional campaign. As a new member of the House Financial Services
Committee, she’s already shaping the conversation with her call to raise
the top marginal tax rate to 70 percent. Former North Carolina Rep. Brad
Miller, a progressive Democrat who served for years on the Financial
Services Committee, joins the conversation to talk about the challenges
Ocasio-Cortez will face there.

Europe's telecoms groups hoped 5G would solve their problems. But the
investment involved, and delays prompted by national security fears,
have spooked companies already under stock market pressure. By Nic Fildes

T he Channel Island of Jersey is perhaps better known for its cows than
its telecoms networks. Yet its 100,000 population benefit from the
second-fastest mobile download speeds in the world, trailing only
Singapore. And now it is enhancing its reputation as a technology hub
with plans to launch a 5G network by 2021, years ahead of any roll out
in the rest of the UK.

Ping! The "Breaking News" alert goes off to notify homeowners that their
HVAC repair guy is on the road. The message reads: He'll arrive in half
an hour. And there's a picture of him, so they know who to be looking
for when a fellow with a toolbox shows up at the door.

If current smartphone usage trends are any indication, this type of
consumer experience could soon move from the exception to the norm. With
some forward-thinking contractors, it's already the reality.

Over the last ten years, we have seen a consistent increase in
multifamily development projects and apartment building construction.
However, despite an increase in supply, the valuation of multifamily
assets still continues to rise. While this is undoubtedly a positive,
investors cannot help but wonder; is this all too good to be true? Can
this long run of apartment building cap rate compression possibly
continue or is its inevitable decline right around the corner?

And while the fear of a market correction may persuade investors to move
on to another asset type, we believe that all this anxiety amounts to
little more than empty chatter. Multifamily units are still a fantastic
investment, vacancies will remain low, and rents will continue to
increase for many years to come.

New job for robots—taking stock for retailers
[https://proxylibrary.hse.ru:2346/articles/new-job-for-robots-taking-stock-for-retailers-11548597600]


Growing services such as rapid home delivery and in-store pickup for
online purchases are “pushing retailers to blur the lines between
distribution centers and stores,” and some stores are testing out a
previously warehouse-exclusive method for fulfilling orders—robots. The
use of robots would resolve retailers' need for constant inventory
counts by store staff, and the data gathered by these units would
additionally help managers make future restocking decisions to optimize
profitability. According to Frederick McCoy, senior vice president at
Jabil Retail, ten big-box retailers are planning to test out in-store
robots in 2019. Read more at The Wall Street Journal

The growth of a transient *millennial* population is seeing the
development of co-living accommodation that meets their needs. Co-living
basically refers to living spaces with shared communal areas, which
helps reduce costs and leads to new friendships and meaningful connections.

While co-living seems innovative, it is not new. Tribal longhouses in
Sarawak have many families living under one roof with communal spaces
for meals, work and play. In the Fujian province in China, there are the
tulou buildings — ancient circular structures that are hundreds of years
old and can house numerous families with shared facilities and social
spaces.

HODA KOTB (08:21:03): Yeah. This morning, how innovators are changing
the field in really dramatic ways and trying to appeal to a younger
crowd. NBC`s Kristen Dahlgren is here with the latest on this. Hey, Kristen.

KRISTEN DAHLGREN (08:21:12): Hey, good morning, guys. Yeah. As you know,
this is big business. So where you may have traditionally thought of
fertility patient as someone older, dozens of new companies are trying
to broaden that definition, appealing to millennials and giving women
the tools to make informed decisions even before they start trying for a
baby. Fertility treatments as we know them are changing fast.

IN AN ERA when just about every medical treatment that can be done at
home is moving in that direction, only about 12% of patients receiving
kidney dialysis do so at home, despite it being cheaper and research
showing it's just as safe.

There are a host of reasons why. Most people cite physicians' lack of
training on home dialysis and their resulting reluctance to suggest it.
Sometimes patients themselves are too sick or overwhelmed to take on
that task.

Pharmaceutical cosmetic company Allergan, maker of wrinkle reducer
Botox, injectable filler Juvederm and eyelash lengthener Latisse, is the
latest conglomerate to go after
millennials[https://www.glossy.co/new-face-of-beauty/even-avon-has-a-millennials-strategy].
On Jan. 28, Allergan released its “Own Your Look” Botox campaign
primarily centered on 20- and 30-something customers.

“We’ve shifted the Botox positioning to not only appeal to our core
client — women that are in their 40s and older — but to also be squarely
targeted at millennials. That’s where we see the growth is for the
brand,” said Carrie Strom, Allergan svp of U.S. medical aesthetics, who
oversees the company’s beauty portfolio, injectables and implants.

When Nordstrom opened its first store in Manhattan last April—a
three-level, 47,000-square-foot men’s store located at 57th and
Broadway—the retailer set a new standard for experiential luxury.

GQ called the Men’s Store “an accurate portrait of what a successful
department store looks like in 2018”—a feat when longstanding Lord &
Taylor and a brand-new Saks Fifth Avenue were plotting store closures in
the city.

Firms are "ill-equipped" to capture *millennial* demand for responsible
investments as 80% of the younger generation indicate interest in the
area, but feel they lack vital information on the topic from providers,
according to research by First State Investments.

A study entitled Millenials & Responsible Investment conducted with
Kepler Cheuvreux of 540 investors, 79% of whom were millennials, found
over 80% of millennials were interested in making responsible investments.

With the announcement on Monday of its new, industry-bred fashion
designer, Reese Witherspoon-founded Draper James is on a mission to
prove it’s not just another celebrity line.

The introduction of Kathryn Sukey, formerly senior design director at
Kate Spade and handbag designer at Coach, reached Draper James customers
on Monday morning across the brand’s communications channels, including
email, social media and draperjames.com. The email featured a personal
letter from Witherspoon along with a photo of her reviewing a table of
sketches with Sukey. It linked to the brand’s new spring collection,
made up of Sukey’s first styles for the brand.

Historically, dental floss, toothpaste and teeth-whitening kits have
been relegated to the oral health section of drugstores, but the divide
between personal-care goods and beauty products is becoming increasingly

Before you tackle lofty financial resolutions like paying off debt this
year, do yourself a quick favor and freeze your credit reports. It's
free, doesn't affect your credit score and helps protect your financial
future.

Credit reports summarize your payment history with creditors and are
automatically generated by the three major credit bureaus:
Equifax,Experian andTransUnion. Freezing them prevents fraudsters from
opening a new line of credit using your personal information.

Was Fyre Festival, in all of its disastrous non-glory, the *millennial*
Woodstock? Sort of!

In the new episode of Rolling Stone Music Now, Brittany Spanos, David
Browne and Andy Greene join host Brian Hiatt to break down the utter
mess that was Fyre, as chronicled in documentaries on both Hulu and
Netflix. It was, in theory, a music festival — with Blink-182 and Major
Lazer, among others, booked to perform — but no one involved, from the
organizers to the attendees, seemed to care very much about the actual
performances.

Content and commerce are both critical for customers to make informed
purchases.

As it is in the world of media, content is king for grocers playing in
the ecommerce space today. The intelligence, insights and interactivity
that grocers provide shoppers through imagery, videos, recipes, chat
bots and more are, in many ways, as valuable to them as the products
that they end up purchasing.

Health and wellness foods - encompassing "free-from," natural and
organic, functional, and other foods targeting specific dietary needs -
is the new normal. The idea of "healthful" food is evolving and
"healthful' doesn't mean bland anymore; nor is it segregated to a
separate supermarket aisle or area on a menu. Healthful foods and
beverages are more integrated into our foods cape, just as producers,
manufacturers and retailers are integrating their efforts around a
common goal of good-tasting, good-for-us food and drink.

How grocers can embrace the concept and communicate it to shoppers.

There's been a lot of talk in recent years about transparency in
government and business, particularly in the food industry, but what
does it mean to be transparent, and how can a retailer convincingly
adopt that stance with those for whom it matters most, its customers?

Abbotsford News -- An new study released Monday shows a disconnect
between millennials' financial realities and retirement expectations.

The study, conducted by Angus Reid Institute, finds one-in-three
Canadians (32 per cent) have put off saving for retirement because of
their debt. Millions more – especially those under the age of 40 – have
put off buying a home (18 per cent), getting married (8 per cent),
having children (7 per cent) or moving out of their parents' homes (5
per cent).

GIG, as we know it now, means an event for a musician/band or, in a more
generic sense, some piece of work/job on a temporary or project basis.
Having gigs, from time to time, gives workers some kind of refreshing
relief from their usual and day-to-day activities in their regular jobs.
In my case, my teaching gigs keep me updated with trends in the law. It
also gives me the opportunity to interact with future lawyers coming
from the *millennial* generation.

Former Rep. Carlos Curbelo, the Florida Republican who lost his seat in
November to Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, has landed a new gig.

Curbelo announced Thursday that he will join the advisory board of the
*Millennial* Action Project, a nonprofit founded during the 2013
government shutdown to urge younger lawmakers to work across the aisle
and to bring civility to the governing process, including on such
divisive issues as climate change and immigration.

Free snacks at work can help workers curb late afternoon hunger — but
will employees be more inclined to stick around because the office has
free food? Probably not, according to a report from recruiting and
staffing firm The Execu Search Group.

Offering freesnacks at work seems like a good way to attract and retain
workers, but it is a misconception that millennials, the largest
generation in the workforce, want the benefit, the report says.

Economic inequality is rising, and fast. The consequences could be
catastrophic — politically, economically and socially.

The juxtaposition had its effect. As the rich, famous and powerful
gathered on the snowy slopes of the exclusive ski town of Davos in the
Swiss Alps for the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF),
British charity Oxfam released its damning take on the state of the
global economy — that just 26 of the world’s richest people, some of
whom have been at Davos in past years, held as much money or assets as
the poorest half of the rest of the world, or 3.8 billion people. By
Oxfam’s estimates, Jeff Bezos, founder of tech giant Amazon.­com and the
world’s richest man, need only donate 1% of his net worth of US$130
billion ($177 billion) to take care of the healthcare budget for the 105
million people of Ethiopia, one of the poorest countries in the world.

It’s over. After 12 years of daily contact, I am finished with Facebook.
It's not easy. We had a long, meaningful connection — my avatar had more
than 1,200 virtual friends from every stage of my life.

Thousands of tiny takes and status updates from two-dimensional
acquaintances had nearly replaced physical, personal contact. And those
digital updates, links and images carried surprising emotional value.
For instance, though my mother died four years ago at 90, I’ve still
wished her happy birthday each year on her dormant Facebook page.

that-and it's poised to transform the healthcare industry.

FreedomCare is New York's leading organization for the Consumer-Directed
Personal Assistance Program (CDPAP)-known nationally as self-directed
care. This revolutionary home healthcare program has transformed the
lives of over 35,000 sick or elderly New Yorkers by allowing them to
hire anyone they choose-a family member, friend, or prior aide-to
provide their day-to-day home care.

2019 JAN 28 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at
Global Warming Focus -- A new study on Climate Change is now available.
According to news reporting originating in Loughborough, United Kingdom,
by VerticalNews journalists, research stated, "Multi-proxy analyses of
an 8 m sediment core from Lake Hayk, a closed, freshwater lake in the
north-central highlands of Ethiopia, provide a record of changing lake
level and inferred regional climatic change for the last 15.6 cal ka
years. Between ca. 15.6-15.2 cal ka BP, a lowstand was synchronous with
Heinrich Event 1 and an intense drought across Eastern Africa. At ca.
15.2-15.2 cal ka BP a lake began to develop at the core site in response
to wetter conditions, at the onset of the African Humid Period (AHP).
However, in contrast to other lakes in eastern Africa, Hayk lake level
fell around ca. 14.8 cal ka BP, indicating a climate shift towards aridity."

Financial support for this research came from University College Cork.

For those aged 30 to 50 - I only just qualify, mind you - the
resurrection of Shipwrecked (E4) prompted a Proustian rush back to the
turn of the millennium, when the suntanned reality show first aired on
Channel 4’s much-mourned youth strand T4.
