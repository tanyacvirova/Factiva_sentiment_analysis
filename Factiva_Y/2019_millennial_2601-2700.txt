After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the 20th century’s
ideological contest seemed over. Capitalism had won and socialism became
a byword for economic failure and political oppression. It limped on in
fringe meetings, failing states and the turgid liturgy of the Chinese
Communist Party. Today, 30 years on, socialism is back in fashion. In
America Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a newly elected congresswoman who
calls herself a democratic socialist, has become a sensation even as the
growing field of Democratic presidential candidates for 2020 veers left.
In Britain Jeremy Corbyn, the hardline leader of the Labour Party, could
yet win the keys to 10 Downing Street.

MUMBAI: Joining the 'Gully Boy' furor is popular 'no fuss' bar BKC Dive!
With a catchy rap, the brand has brought alive the vibe of the venue.
The new rendition showcases how super chill, pocket - friendly and
thrilling of a hub it is; projects the essence of the brand further
inviting youngsters to join in the mania along with their bunch of Bantaais.

The fun and energetic video ties in the pulse of the *millennial* and
encapsulates how the typical patron of the restro - bar is. Cool, quirky
and fun!

courts will probably block President Trump from declaring a national

The campaign conceptualised by BBDO India focuses on the goodness of
almonds for hunger satisfaction and talks about stopping all kinds of
irresponsible behaviour

Mars Wrigley Confectionery India has launched a new variant of its
chocolate brand Snickers - the all new Snickers Almonds that offers a
base of nougat and crushed almonds, topped with a layer of diced almond
mixed with caramel and enrobed with chocolate.

Needs are a funny thing – and right now, my need for poultry trumps my
need to never speak to anyone on the phone

Growing up means getting your hands dirty sometimes. In my case, that
included the somewhat pitiful job of phoning a Nando’s, hungover, and
begging it to accept Deliveroo orders at midday. (“Look, I know you’ve
only been open since 11, but I need wings or I’ll die! Yes, I’ll hold
for the manager.”)

There is no doubt the Valley’s job creation machine is humming
along[https://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/news/2019/02/05/job-growth-to-fuel-phoenix-economy-in-2019-report.html].
That means younger people are finding work in the area, particularly in
the key 25-34 age demographic.

Nonetheless, I was still startled when I dug into U.S. Census population
migration numbers crunched by the Brookings Institution.

Anthony Vaccarello has nearly finished giving a tour of the just-opened
140,000-square-foot headquarters of fashion house Yves Saint Laurent in
a tony corner of Paris's seventh arrondissement when, heading toward the
exit, he says he's saved his favorite part for last. After looping
across the vast courtyard of the former 18th-century abbey, through the
showrooms, we pass through the front gate at the rue de Bellechasse.
There, on the driveway at the edge of the sidewalk, the cobblestones
under our feet rumble as we slowly start to descend: It turns out to be
a platform elevator that takes us down, Bond-villain style, to a small
parking lot. Painted black lacquer with gleaming white markers, it's
more appropriate for an upscale bondage club than a place to stash the
company's off-duty town cars.

The bigger the trauma, the greater the harvest of “vibes”: cancer was a
banker, a job loss would do OK, your cat dying was the mother lode.

In my first life on the internet, I belonged to the knitosphere. This
was sometime around 2005, before Twitter and even before Facebook, but
after the Usenet era, when the internet was the joyful kingdom of the
true geeks. One day, as a beginner knitter struggling to make sense of
what a “yarn over” was, I clicked through from the pattern site to the
message board, posted my question, and was rewarded with cheerfully
supportive answers from other users. (A “yarn over”, by the way, is a
deliberate hole made for knitting lace. I finished the pattern. The
jumper was horrible.)

WASHINGTON — Are senior homeowners preventing millennials from buying
houses? Could the decisions of millions of older owners to “age in
place” rather than sell their homes explain why millennials are lagging
behind in homeownership?

A provocative new study
(tinyurl.com/y3why5mh[http://tinyurl.com/y3why5mh]) from federally
chartered mortgage investor Freddie Mac suggests the answer may be yes.
“Who is living in those homes that millennials might otherwise have
bought?” ask the study’s authors. Their answer: baby boomers, war babies
and people born in the 1930s.

Real estate industry players have got millennials on the mind. Most
members of this generation - the oldest of whom were born in the early
1980s and the youngest in the early aughts - have now reached adulthood.
Inquiring minds want to know: What impact will their choices have on
Canada's real estate market?

Findings made public this month from two surveys of millennials and Gen
Xers found that the stereotype of the *millennial* spendthrift who is
more interested in Ubering to Instagram-worthy selfie spots and booking
Pinterest-worthy Airbnbs than investing in a home is unfounded.

The candidates for Tampa mayor have several ideas to address growing
concerns about affordable housing in the city.

Transit plays a role in affordable housing, especially in the downtown
area, some candidates say. Others suggest alternatives like tiny homes
or those made of shipping containers.

The Buffalo region has a reputation as an emerging urban center but
decision makers have to do a better attracting young professionals.

And those young professionals should be encouraged to take a more active
role in the region’s leadership.

In recent years, millennials have become the main objective of
attracting all types of companies because they are the new big
consumers, but perhaps we have focused so much on conquering the
*millennial* public that we have not noticed how long it takes to
understand them; they change, evolve and age, modifying all kinds of
habits. And it is that although at the beginning of their working life
millennials preferred cash to debit or credit cards, the popularization
of transport or food apps - which require a card to be used -
accelerated the adoption of them. According to the study of the payment
processor TSYS Merchant Solutions, published in 2018, after this
generation turns 25, it starts to obtain and use more plastic as a means
of payment. Currently these consumers, in addition to better options in
their credit products, demand something fundamental: online security.

SEATTLE — Personal finance professionals live too often in the realm of
tools and tactics, optimization and automation. All too frequently,
their advice — our advice — is utterly bloodless.

Gaby Dunn, Chanel Reynolds and Vicki Robin are not everyday personal
finance practitioners. Ms. Dunn and Ms. Reynolds use vulgarities in the
subtitles of their new money books, and Ms. Robin speaks openly of
dropping acid, mental illness and the cancer scars on her stomach.

work in the gig economy need to achieve the right balance between
managing their short-term and long-term financial goals

Gone are the days of the nine-to-five job for an increasing number of
Canadians. As the “flexforce” – also known as the “gig economy” – grows,
more and more workers, particularly millennials, are making ends meet by
maintaining several temporary, flexible and typically part-time jobs
instead of one full-time position.

Although the gig economy provides workers with a degree of flexibility,
it also comes with several financial challenges, including job
precariousness, irregular payment cycles and the burden of saving for
taxes and retirement without the assistance of a full-time employer. And
for financial advisors and financial planners, working with clients who
are part of the gig economy requires finding a unique set of strategies
for tackling these challenges.

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is desperately trying to

That means going for big-name hosts like The Rock (who reportedly
couldn't take the gig) and Kevin Hart (who accepted and then bowed out
amid controversy).

New Delhi, Feb. 15 -- The bisexual Ludhiana-born personal trainer has
her work cut out with the new client, an actor who knows that her time
in the business is limited since 50-year-old heroes only want to work
with 20-something heroines.

So, how do you get her into her best shape ever? By yelling out choice
Punjabi gaalis, never mind if nearly all have to do with women's body
parts and are in themselves sexist and misogynist.

'So, is there anyone… special, on the cards?’ We are in my grandmother’s
best room. Songs of Praise plays on the television. She pours proper tea
from a pot and pats an embroidered cushion on the sofa for me to sit
down. The cushion says, 'In Christ alone my hope is found'.

‘There is, actually. I have a girlfriend. Well, a sort-of girlfriend –
we haven’t had the talk yet. She’s a lesbian, although I think she
prefers “queer”. I guess you could call me “bi”, but I hate labels; I
just like who I like. *Millennial* of me, I know… Anyway, we’re seeing
each other, but now she’s trying for a baby with her best friend – a gay
man – and I get it because she’s 38 and her eggs won’t last for ever.
Plus I really do like her... So yes, I’m in a casual semi-relationship.
Or a potential thr-ouple. Or something.’

The Pathmark supermarket banner — a metropolitan New York mainstay for
decades before its demise with the A&P bankruptcy in 2015 — is being
rekindled by grocery retail cooperative Allegiance Retail Services LLC.

Allegiance said Thursday that a 49,000-square-foot Pathmark store is now
being built in central Brooklyn, N.Y., and is slated to open in late
March or early April. The store’s owner/operator is Mount Vernon,
N.Y.-based PSK Supermarkets LLC, which runs approximately a dozen stores
in metro New York primarily under the Foodtown banner.

In society today, perhaps the biggest gap we need to worry about is the
one between generations.

There is a distinct disconnect, a dearth of understanding. The term
*millennial* is one of derision used by anyone older than 32. Younger
generations struggle to trust or listen to the older ones, because they
cannot possibly understand what it is like to be young today. Meanwhile
the older groupings become more frustrated with each subsequent younger
demographic as they struggle even more to relate. It goes both ways, of
course.

The youngsters, who make their debut with Hum Chaar, talk about their
off-screen and on-screen friendship

For Anshuman Malhotra, Prit Kamani and Tushar Pandey, three of the four
actors from Rajshri Productions' Hum Chaar, their bonding began even
before they started shooting for their debut film, thanks to Mumbai's
geography! How did that happen? "Rajshri's office is at Prabhadevi and
most of us are based in the suburbs. I stay in Juhu, and Anshuman is
there almost all the time. So, when Tushar said he's in Versova, mere
dil mein laddoo phoota! Because that meant we could all share autos and
taxis!" laughs Prit, recounting their rehearsals and workshop days.

Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido's latest Instagram selfie got
over half a million likes. Even his dog has nearly 30,000 followers.

President Nicolas Maduro might have dismissed the 35-year-old as a "kid
playing politics" -- but experts say his *millennial* status could give
him an edge over the middle-aged socialist leader.

OTHERS Urvashi Butalia on diversity in the women’s movement This
weekend, Zubaan Books, the feminist publisher, and India Culture Lab
collaborate on ‘So Many Feminisms!’ Urvashi Butalia, founder and
director of Zubaan, chatted with The Hindu about the many strands of
feminist thought, and what to expect from the event. Why, we asked, is
this conclave necessary? “There are many ways in which women, and some
men, are approaching feminism and identifying as feminists,” says
Butalia. “Feminism is trying to grapple with this, understand how to
work together, how to look at things like caste, queer identities, and a
range of other issues. It makes sense to take stock, to examine the many
things happening; and speculate about what the future might look like.”

Bengaluru, Feb. 15 -- Aditya Jain did many rounds of paying guest (PG)
facilities before he zeroed in on Oyo Living's new, shared living
facility in Bengaluru's AECS Layout. He has taken up a bed in a
twin-sharing room in a four-storey building at a monthly rent of '9,000.
Jain, 27, who migrated to Bengaluru from his home town Jaipur last
November and works at privacy-centric communication startup Clevert,
says he didn't like the quality of the crammed PG rooms. "The rent [at
Oyo] is a bit on the higher side in this property, but after a day's
work, you want good sleep (sic) and a clean place. My office is just a
kilometre away and I usually walk to work. In the weekends, some of us
get together and play foosball or other indoor games in the community
area. There is also a kitchen which we can use, and I love cooking," he
said. AECS Layout in Bengaluru's eastern edge is a bustling residential
area, dotted with scores of buildings offering PG accommodation.

Treasury Wine Estates chief executive Mike Clarke says the company is
poised to acquire up to two small wineries in France along with premium
vineyards to supercharge a push into China with a portfolio of three
French-made wines, one of which will be branded Penfolds.

Mr Clarke said the fragmented French wine category makes up 40 per cent
of the total wine market in China, and the company wants to secure a
chunk with some French-sourced labels to sit alongside the hugely
successful Penfolds wines from Australia, which have been a major driver
of impressive profit growth in China.

Housing affordability could be driving the voting decisions of young
people with a new survey also showing many millennials are still
undecided about who to back at the next federal election.

The Australian *Millennial* Report 2019 [http://www.millennialfuture.co]
surveyed about 1206 Australians online aged 19-36 in January 2019 and
asked them about politics, how they got their news and what was most
important to them. It also identified a number of “personas” to show the
differences between millennials of different ages.

The early stages of the 2020 Democratic primary have been more of a
lovefest than a slugfest.

New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand welcomed Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar's
wintry announcement with a warm tweet celebrating her "Senate sisters" —
a groundbreaking group of four women that includes 2020 contenders
California's Kamala Harris and Massachusetts' Elizabeth Warren.

Liberty Shoes has been in the footwear business for ages, always looking
to diversify its current product base. The group's CEO Adesh Gupta says
the company settled on making inroads into lifestyle. In an exclusive
interview with S&A;, the CEO explains, "After a lot of research, we
finally zeroed down on perfumes because the fragrance segment currently
occupies 5 per cent share of the total lifestyle market in India giving
us a huge window for growth. The need for personal grooming has slowly
increased and inched its way into the minds of milenials as a need more
than a luxury."

A Patagonia fleece pullover may not be the first item that comes to mind
when you think of streetwear, but it should be.

At Project Las Vegas last week, WGSN trend consultant Rachel Dimit
shared how Fall ’19 streetwear trends are culling inspiration from
unlikely sources, including the outdoor market and the country club.

Simplified and often unconventional spaces, adaptability, comfort, and
an emphasis on collaboration. Today’s workplace patently combines
function with form – and furniture is taking a front seat in this
redefinition of “the office.”

The “typical” workspace is quickly being relegated to “thing of the
past” status, particularly in light of the *Millennial* generation,
which now represents a significant percentage of office workers. This
new breed of employees is more inclined toward open-concept,
collaborative work spaces, alternative and technology integrated furniture.

First-time filmmaker Ariel Kavoussi hit upon a very relatable idea when
she began working on her debut film: why not twist the trope of the
mediocre white man into something a bit more satisfying? She turned her
fantasy into reality (or at least, something close to it) in “The Poet
and the Professor,” a short film starring Kavoussi as a woman stuck in a
love triangle with two pathetic older men, played by Kevin Corrigan and
Bob Byington. The film’s title is a reference to Jean Eustache’s 1973
film “The Mother and the Whore,” and also features a love triangle as
its narrative core. By inverting the genders and centering her (deeply
flawed) character, Kavoussi has made a truly absurdist, provocative, and
contemporary feminist film.

“Female desire is not the simple, one-dimensional thing most mainstream
films have lazily pigeonholed it to be,” Kavoussi said in a statement.
Her goal with the film, she added, was to explore the “multifarious
nature of desire, pleasure and the erotic.”

For their brand new series of cheekily titled short films — all named
after already-popular offerings, from “No Country for Old Men” to “The
Unbearable Lightness of Being” — filmmakers Will Blank and Jake Bradbury
aimed for a truly minimalist approach. Each film was conceived of and
made within the space of just one day, all focusing on some uniquely
*millennial* issues.

For both Blank and Bradbury — both lauded short filmmakers with a ton of
other projects on their plates: Blank recently made the award-winning
short “Limbo,” starring Sam Elliott, and is currently working on the
Steven Spielberg-helmed reboot of “Amazing Stories,” while Bradbury has
worked with Netflix, Maxim, and CBS — getting back to their indie roots
was key.

The Public Health Agency of Canada says at least 30 Canadians who had
surgery at a clinic in Tijuana, Mexico are at risk of potentially deadly
infection.

But the agency isn't sure, because of the difficulty in responding to
health alerts in other countries.

Long before he was the man who wrote “Despacito” — one of the world’s
most ubiquitous and all-time greatest hits — he was Luis Fonsi, the
Spanish-language heartthrob with *millennial* pop charisma. He toured
with Britney, recorded with Christina and, with every album, he steadily
ascended the mainstream Billboard charts by the power of his evocative
Latin balladry.

Yet even longer before that, he was Luis Alfonso Rodríguez López-Cepero,
the bespectacled new kid at his Orlando, Florida middle school. A
transplant from San Juan, Puerto Rico, he didn’t speak much English, but
he could carry a tune; he joined the school’s choir and promptly earned
himself the nickname, “Fonsi Rodríguez,” after the Fonz from Happy Days.
(He still can’t say why that is — perhaps the hair?) By the time he was
in high school, he was busking around Orlando’s theme parks with his a
cappella group, the Big Guys, which co-starred his best friend and
future ‘NSync member, Joey Fatone.

ALMOST a third of employees in the West Midlands said they would rather
use telemedicine services than visit their GP practice.

A study of 2,000 UK workers by Willis Towers Watson found that 30 per
cent of workers in the region would rather go online and use video links
to access GP services, such as medical advice, consultations or
prescriptions.

Is it too early for this? Or is it … too late?

Roughly four years ago, when I compiled a cheat sheet of the 2016
candidates[https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/08/2016-election/384828/?utm_source=feed],
it seemed like an exercise in absurdly early coverage of the
presidential election. Yet because so many people were contemplating
running (largely on the GOP side of the ledger), it also seemed like a
useful service to voters, who might have trouble keeping track of everyone.

Ogilvy Philippines recently organized BrandCamp, a workshop for emerging
Filipino brands, which brought together small and medium enterprises
with fresh takes on products, services, and industries; a promising
audience; and a growing brand. This was an opportunity to learn about
marketing communications from one of the world's leading agencies.

'Ogilvy was founded on one man's entrepreneurial spirit, and it's
exactly the kind of spirit we want to encourage in more Filipinos,' said
Ogilvy Philippines CEO Elly Puyat. 'BrandCamp gives emerging brands an
opportunity to learn key marketing communications principles, get the
chance to consult with experts, and start to think about branding and
marketing as a long-term pursuit.'

Little about The Wonderful Company’s new wine brand is practical.
Brought from conception to market in less than a year, the JNSQ brand
recently came on the market with a line of rosé and sauvignon blanc—in
the middle of winter. The ornate packaging was inspired by vintage
luxury perfume bottles, created by a French glass designer and features
resealable glass stoppers for reusability.

Armed with the insight that preferences among *millennial* wine
drinkers, and *millennial* women in particular, had shifted toward rosé
and sauvignon blanc, marketers at The Wonderful Company—best-known for
Fiji Water andPistachios—decided to create a new wine brand: JNSQ.

2019 FEB 14 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Women's
Health Weekly -- Each year, thousands of younger women with no known
risk of breast cancer get mammograms before having breast reduction surgery.

Patients receive the exam, often at the suggestion of their doctors,
when the best recommendation says to avoid routine mammograms before
elective breast surgery unless a specific concern exists.

It seems fitting to reach back into a deceased automaker's final brand
message when trying to describe how differently today's fast-emerging
direct-to-consumer brands market their products than most of the brands
we grew up with.

D2C brands like ThirdLove (lingerie) and Dagne Dover (bags) are not your
father's marketers — not by a mile.

Who knew plaid was the hot new pattern to rock this winter? Barbara
Palvin AND Priyanka Chopra both wore it during NYFW. See the pics!

There are many *millennial* fashion trends that make total sense: neon
colors, high-waisted anything, crop tops, etc. But there’s one look that
we weren’t expecting to see (and love!) on celebrities this year. Two
very different – but equally stylish – stars donned neutral plaid looks
during New York Fashion Week; they are Priyanka Chopra and Barbara Palvin.
