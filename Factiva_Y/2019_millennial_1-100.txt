Created by local artists, the 'House of Eternal Return' is mind-blowing
in all the best ways

Santa Fe has long been a mecca for artists and art lovers. From the many
galleries lining Canyon Road to the legacy of Georgia O'Keeffe and
artisanship of the Northern Pueblo Indian tribes, New Mexico's capital
city has offered world travelers a wide and colorful artistic palette
from which to choose.

For Shaza Andersen, starting a new bank is as much a personal decision
as a financial one.

The day after the $2.1 billion-asset WashingtonFirst, the bank she
founded 15 years ago, announced it would be sold, Andersen remembers how
quiet the office was, the typical chatter among employees muted as they
processed the news.

Bret Easton Ellis is no stranger to bad publicity. Ever since his 1985
debut, “Less Than Zero,” made him a literary sensation, his violently
nihilistic fiction and his politically incorrect public persona have
earned him as much fury as acclaim. And after three decades, five
subsequent novels and a story collection, a podcast and more than a
handful of media spats, Ellis still has more to say. On April 16, he
will publish his first book in nine years — and his nonfiction debut —
an essay collection called
“White.”[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/17/books/review/bret-easton-ellis-white.html]
Not everybody is going to like it. He doesn’t care.

“I feel very loose about this,” he said. “This is kind of a book for a
Bret Easton Ellis completist.”

The signpost ahead reads “The Twilight Zone,” ushering viewers to a
realm that at once feels familiar and yet is almost entirely new.
Executive producers Jordan Peele and Simon Kinberg have reimagined Rod
Serling’s classic horror/science-fiction/fantasy series from the ‘60s
for a whole new generation.

At an event in Hollywood this year, Kinberg revealed why it was the
perfect time to bring back the show. “I think the world all of a sudden
was in desperate need of ‘The Twilight Zone,’” he said. ‘If you said
three, four years ago that like a reality star who had no political
experience will be the leader of the free world with access to the
nuclear button, you think that’s a crazy ‘Twilight Zone’ episode.”

"The client, Marga Group, was working on The Central, a big development
in Yangon [Myanmar], with residences, office space, shopping, F&B [food
and beverage], and they were looking to run some of the F&B concepts
themselves, including a food hall featuring desserts for the
*millennial* market. They gave me a double height, street-side space and
asked me to design a food courtselling local and imported desserts."

For more than a century, movies as a medium have served to reinforce a
certain view of female sexuality that served to benefit … whom? Not the
female sex, really, but men — or a male-dominated culture that wanted
women to be more receptive to their advances, on one hand, even as it
reinforced the idea that giving in too easily, or to more than one
partner, made them “sluts.” Was this deliberate indoctrination on the
part of filmmakers? That’s a question for graduate theses and
sociologists to answer, but the impact was clear in everything from the
Production Code to John Hughes movies.

UPDATE, 2nd SUNDAY AM Update 9:30AM after 8:08AM post: With chart
Disney’s Dumbo didn’t leave a big footprint with a meh $45M opening
after a $17.5M Saturday, which, next to Friday-plus previews, is +16%.
This is not one of the better openings for a tentpole-conceived live
action remake of a Disney ‘toon from a marquee director. After shelling
out $170M to make a movie based on a 78-year old Disney cornerstone
character, this can’t be celebrated as a grand slam in the wake of
Beauty and the Beast, Jungle Book, Cinderella, and Maleficent.
Sorry, Dumbo didn’t soar, but he wasn’t completely grounded either.
Disney is calling Dumbo at $45M, which is under the $50M+ start they
hoped for and the crazy $60M estimates a couple of B.O. analysts were
seeing.

As we said in the previous update, Dumbo wasn’t a case of the studio
fumbling marketing. He’s just an old, melancholy elephant, even if he
does fly, and, well, that’s not a sell-out.

'SO it returns," James Joyce wrote in Ulysses. "Think you're escaping
and run into yourself. Longest way round is the shortest way home."
Colin Farrell has been on that Joycean journey of self-discovery for as
long as he can remember.

The star of In Bruges, Intermission, Phone Booth and, now Dumbo, lives
in a mansion high in the Hollywood hills but he lives more in his heart
and in his head than within its fancy walls. With it all, Colin exhibits
the charm of a man who is open to laying himself bare emotionally,
albeit wittily. He shows regard for, and empathy with, people.

For weeks now I’ve been seeing a persistent rumor circulating in social
media: that the prophet of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints, Russell M. Nelson, is about to lift the ban on members drinking
coffee and tea.

Now before I go on the record as saying that I think this rumor is, at
best, wishful thinking on the part of people who would like to gulp down
a guilt-free frappuccino, let me out myself as an utter failure at
giving credence to other early rumors when those rumors did, in fact,
wind up bearing fruit.

It is a truth universally acknowledged that we millennials will never be
able to afford a house of our own. Perhaps it is time to put to rest the
thickening tirade of false accusations of laziness and underachieving
and gaming and overprotection, in order to realise it is really because
the price of one month’s gym membership is worth more than our entire
street put together.

Since when did fitness become the business investment of a lifetime?
When was the law passed that decreed all joggers must have £50 leggings
in ubiquitous shades of “loaded” and “loathed”, and trainers to rival
the cost of their car? Who decided that it was a shocking show of
shameless immorality to get on a bike without donning a skin-tight
pledge of allegiance to BT Home Hub? Accept the sad mortifying truth:
you are not in the Tour de France.

demonstrators on Sunday protested against alleged cheating in the
junta-ruled kingdom’s first election since a 2014 coup, a week after the
controversial poll sowed confusion over the ballot results.

A military-backed party and its main rival tied to a self-exiled
billionaire have both claimed the right to lead the government as
inconsistent tallies released by the Election Commission have raised
suspicion among voters.

It was a week of extremes for President Trump. First he raised his arms
in victory after his attorney general laid out his summary of the
Mueller report Sunday -- then he promptly sent his team to court to try
to throw out the Affordable Care Act.

Even though cries of Republicans-gutting-your-health-care were
instrumental to Democrats winning the House in last year's midterm
elections, there was the President touting "no collusion" in one breath
and in the next handing the Democrats more fresh, hot ammunition.

When Kim Kardashian wore a vintage cutaway dress by Thierry Mugler to
the Hollywood Beauty Awards last month, it was swiftly duplicated and
put to market the next day by ultrafast fashion brand Fashion Nova. The
copy was decried, but Diet Prada, a popular fashion-focused Instagram
account, went one step further: It highlighted the suspicious timing in
the photo’s metadata that seemed to prove the product was shot four days
before Kardashian wore the cutout dress in public and suggested that the
copycat version was a result of collusion with someone who had insider
knowledge.

Over the past few weeks Diet Prada has doggedly followed the social
superstar’s every look-alike outfit and vintage-inspired fashion
exploit, recently suggesting a lacy slip dress she wore was a near-copy
of a 1996 Versace look.

A major biography like First by Evan Thomas draws its power not only
from the people and events it depicts but also from the culture into
which it’s launched. The white-hot polarization in the age of Trump
makes Sandra Day O’Connor’s preference for cool civility and compromise
seem especially appealing. And this era’s struggle for women’s rights,
energized by the #TimesUp and #MeToo movements, makes this the right
time to take stock of the country club cowgirl who managed to climb
higher than any American woman had before.

On Aug. 19, 1981, President Ronald Reagan made good on a campaign
promise to appoint a woman to the Supreme Court. O’Connor got the call
and breezed through her confirmation with a 99-to-0 vote.

Although it may feel like ancient history, and remembered about as
clearly, it was just last week that Finance Minister Bill Morneau
introduced the Liberal's final, pre-election budget, a 460-page basket
of goodies titled “Investing in the Middle Class.”

A government's last budget before an election is usually its most
strategic, and effective, opportunity to not only communicate its vision
and priorities but to make the case for why it deserves another term in
office.

This week, Lloyd's reported its 2018 results, halving the aggregated
market loss of 2017 to 1bn. Recently appointed chief executive John Neal
commented "Over the last six months, we have asked hundreds of
stakeholders to tell us how we should evolve Lloyd’s to build a
collective vision for the future. A full prospectus is to be published
on 1st May that discusses the future of insurance at Lloyd’s." The day
before the results were released, Lloyd's announced a robust plan of
action to address reports of sexual harassment. The Corporation also
issued a new report highlighting that an estimated $163bn of assets are
underinsured in the world today. Experts from the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change(IPCC) will meet in Edinburgh from tomorrow to
5th April to launch their work on the Working Group III contribution to

It has been a bitter season. Britain lies divided, gripped by an
identity crisis, its future uncertain. Sectarian violence flares.
Terrorism and freak weather. There are resurgences of deadly disease,
famine, portents of worse to come. Life on this planet suddenly seems
too fragile to be borne.

We can affirm that most Utahns are sane, commonsense people who are
exhausted by the Mueller investigation. They're also tired of the
never-ending fight over SB54 and Count My Vote. We contribute to the
fatigue by exploring, one more time, the impact of these issues on our
state. Last week, Gov. Gary Herbert vetoed SB123, which gave party
delegates control over naming candidates to run in a special election to
fill a congressional vacancy. This is a continuation of the fight over
SB54 and whether all voters, or just delegates, choose candidates. Will
the governor's veto be upheld, or will the Legislature override the
governor, putting power in the hands of party delegates? Pignanelli: "My
friends, no matter how rough the road, we can and we will, never
surrender to what is right." - Dan Quayle The idiom "bad penny"
describes an unpleasant or unwanted thing which repeatedly appears at
inopportune times.

then, her Twitter handle (@MadhuraKarekar) has been flooded with

issues, including potholes, water leakages and littering, among others.

She doesn't shirk any request, solving most cases within 24 hours flat.

Some on the right say it’s wrong for Trump and his followers to fixate
on the young New York Democrat. Others are convinced she’s electoral poison

“It’s weird,” Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez mused on NBC’s Late Night with
Seth Meyers[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjLoHgvBhCI] earlier this
month. “Why are so many grown men just obsessed with this, like,
29-year-old?”

YOU know when a pair of runners are really cool? And all the cool kids
and hip bloggers have them? And then they get so cool that they become
ubiquitous and the parents of the cool kids and hip bloggers buy a kind
of less-cool Clarks version of them? And the parent says to their kid,
"Look! we can match!" and the kid rolls their eyes because no one
actually cool has worn those runners for a year now? For some reason the
news that the Central Statistics Office (CSO) is testing a question
about sexuality for the 2026 census giving options of heterosexual,
lesbian, gay or bisexual put me in mind of exactly that.

Food assistance in the United States has always had two arms: the food
bank or pantry part ("here's a five-pound bag of flour to take home")
and the soup kitchen part ("come in out of the cold and pull up a
chair"). The trouble is, that doesn't reflect how Americans are eating.

We dine out, on average, four times per week - more if you're a
*millennial*. We want quick-serve. We want grab-and-go and prepared
food. We want Grubhub and DoorDash and Uber Eats. We want to wear our
pajamas when the nice person brings us a delicious hot meal in a foam
clamshell.

Travel can jar us out of our routines, and often that's the whole point
of it. But what about the routines you'd rather not leave at home - such
as your fitness regimen? Sure, you could lie to yourself about hitting
the hotel gym or hope you'll find a jogging route in a foreign land, but
that's typically a formula for coming home five pounds heavier.

Beto and Biden, BetoandBiden, BetoBiden, Betoden. Say it five times fast
and two of the most well-known (potential) 2020 Democratic presidential
candidates morph into some kind of celebrity supercouple akin to J.Rod
and Kimye. Okay, not exactly like that, but you get the picture. For
now, they're connected.

Beto O'Rourke, the former congressman from Texas no one had ever heard
of before the midterms, and former vice president Joe Biden, whom fans
(and foes) affectionately call "Uncle Joe," are a pop culture package
deal. In December, RealClear Politics suggested their best shot is to
run together, and the Associated Press reported Biden was considering
O'Rourke as a running mate. A Biden/Beto 2020 vintage T-shirt is
available on Etsy for $19.99.

A lorry driver's daughter accused of duping Manhattan by posing as an
heiress is causing a stir with her court stylist

On day one it was a low-cut black Miu Miu dress with an eye-catching
choker. On day two she went for a diaphanous Yves Saint-Laurent blouse
with pleated Victoria Beckham slacks.

Ezra Koenig is back with a thrilling new album. In a world exclusive,
the Vampire Weekend frontman talks growing up, politics, and how he
deals with the dark times

Vampire Weekend is such a bizarre phenomenon," says the band's singer,
Ezra Koenig, laughing. He is wearing a coat that looks so much like a
dressing gown, I think he has turned up to meet me in his pyjamas. "We
started out with songs called Mansard Roof, doing college dress-up, and
it was improbable anybody would like that. I imagined people finding it
curious, but to stick with it for a decade? It's bizarre."

Dermot Desmond may be regretting his sizeable investment in diamond
mines, writes Brian Carey

Markle sparkle is probably the unlikeliest of all Dermot Desmond's
concerns. The financier last week was grappling with an accounting
scandal at Datalex, the travel software company where he is the largest
shareholder. Yet Desmond's other interests would appear to be at the
mercy of *millennial* fashion.

DANCE of DEMOCRACYPolitical parties have discovered the virtues of
campaigning via Instagram ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Memes,
short explainer videos, cartoons and parody songs - the ruling BJP and
opposition Congress are pulling no punches on the photosharing platform
to reach out to millennials, the Gen-Z and first-time voters.

In the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, Twitter and Facebook played an important
role in social media campaigns. Political parties woke up late to the
influence of Instagram. All national political parties, barring
Congress, opened their official Instagram accounts only after the 16th
general elections were over. Congress posted its first picture on the
platform in March 2014. BJP started using the platform officially in
2015, followed by Trinamool Congress in 2016 and Aam Aadmi Party in 2017.

UPSTARTS' CORNERNihar Bobba's father is a serial entrepreneur. May be
because of that, Bobba says, he was certain even while at school that he
would end up starting a venture of his own.

And that's what happened. It was 2016-17. Bobba, now 24, had just
returned to India after a consulting stint in the US, and was stumped by
the financial dichotomy in a *millennial*'s life. "One one side, we have
a highly aspirational population, and on the other, they have limited
incomes and poor savings habits," he says.

The *millennial* bride gets an ancient muse from glorious women who
belonged to royal courts and palaces of the 17 century. Everything about
that era was grand. The splendour extended to every matter of life, with
clothes getting special thought. Taking notes from erstwhile
conventions, fashion designers Shyamal and Bhumika have launched their
Summer bridal couture called Memoirs of A Maharani. The needle and
thread once again capture the sartorial elegance that was characteristic
of that period and for good reason. “In the 1600s there was very little
military activity and so the courtiers, noblemen and their ladies spent
time experimenting with style and fashion which changed the way they
thought and dressed. Garments were treated as works of art and even
inspired poetry,” says Shyamal Shodhan.

A coup leader triumphs as civilian prime minister, an alliance of
parties unite to stop him, or a parliamentary deadlock forces another
political crisis -- the outcome of Thailand's disputed election remains
undecided a week after the poll.

So what next? Here are the possible scenarios for how the election could
play out.

From Martha Washington to Melania Trump, the role of US first lady is as
old as the republic itself.

But if one of half a dozen Democrat hopefuls get their way in 2020, the
nation could soon have a first gentleman -- potentially even the husband
of America's first gay president -- move into the White House.

The first and according to insiders the “only” choice for Karisma
Kapoor's role in David Dhawan's remake of his own movie Coolie No 1 was
Alia Bhatt.

In fact, the entire project was re-formatted to suit Varun Dhawan and
Alia as the *millennial*'s Govinda and Karisma. But then, Alia is
completely immersed in her work commitments until the end of the year.
More importantly, it was felt that the Alia-Varun pair must be rendered
exclusive for the ‘Dulhaniya' series.

Shame has long been a tool used to moderate behaviour and influence
entire societies, and in North Korea the weekly ritual of self-criticism
— or saenghwal chonghwa — is practised from the cradle to the grave.

Shame moves people to do things in a number of different ways, and for
those in power seeking to influence behaviour on a mass scale, shame is
an effective tool to weaponise.

CHICAGO -- Fast-casual chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc . and
Panera Bread are tapping the fast-food playbook as they grapple for
growth with old-school stalwarts like McDonald's Corp . and Burger King .

The latest evidence? The drive-thru window, a mid-20th century
innovation, is back in the limelight as chains competing for "share of
stomach" hone in on the convenience factor.

In a recent campaign stop at an Iowa City pizza parlor, Sen. Kirsten
Gillibrand was interrupted by a woman making her way through the crowd.
"Sorry, I'm just trying to get some ranch, said Hanna Kinney, and in an
instant, an internet folk hero was born.

These days, it seems as if we're all just trying to get some ranch. The
dressing, which has long vacillated between derided symbol of American
caloric excess and nostalgic favorite, is on the upswing once again.
"Haters, it's time to come back to the ranch (dressing), proclaimed a
recent Wall Street Journal headline. A September 2018New York Times
story deemed America "Ranch Nation.

That's the highest level since 2007.

"Understanding your options and making a plan is imperative, says Billy

Muslim generations are labelled according to their watershed years, when
our emotional landscapes changed forever. For some it was 2002, others
2014. For my generation, it was 1992.

I was getting ready to go for a lunch with colleagues when the news came
that the Babri Masjid had been brought down. Within minutes, the Muslim
ghetto in which we lived was reverberating with the sounds of
“Nara-e-takbeer, Allah-o-Akbar,” or, “Our slogan is, God is great.”

* Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said Modern Monetary Theory
(MMT) should be "a larger part of the conversation" in an interview with
Insider in January.

* MMT is a big departure from conventional economic theory. It proposes
governments that control their own currency can spend freely, as they
can always create more money to pay off debts in their own currency.

When Hilton Carter bought his first plant, he didn’t start small – or easy.

No resilient cacti or solid sansevieria for him, but rather an enormous
Ficus ­lyrata, better known as the fiddle-leaf fig, the house plant that
will come to define the *millennial* fascination with greenery. “I’d
eyeballed it,” he explains, over Skype from his native Baltimore. “I
would look at design books and see fiddle-leaf figs everywhere. But for
me, it was about the particular plant itself, the shape of its leaves,
the way it looked.” So Carter brought it into his home, which was then
in New Orleans’ French Quarter – a place blessed with five
floor-to-ceiling windows – and named the plant Frank.

Commercial real estate honcho Stan Krawitz has been a bonanza for
Toronto men's dress-for-success charities. He has been culling his suit
closet recently, a collection that he had "invested in heavily," over
his three decades in business. The roster of 18 suits is now down to four.

Blame the techies. "It became absolutely obvious that showing up in
(Toronto's up-and-coming tech hub) Liberty Village in a suit and tie -
much less a dark suit and an institutional tie - was the kiss of death,"
says the vice-chair, founder and head of Canada for Savills brokerage.
"You'd get stares, and hear people asking, 'Are we being audited by the
CRA (Canadian Revenue Service)?' "

Mundane, aging buildings are increasingly being replaced with no regard
for the pleasant feelings they can conjure. Odessa Paloma Parker wonders
where we go from here

Sometimes, the simplest thing can quell what ails us. Ask any wellness
aficionado and they'll tell you that grounding – the act of putting your
bare feet in grass – can help to “nourish your soul" by connecting you
with the Earth's energy. It's deemed essential in today's hectic climate
because the act can make you feel calmer (or at least less irritated),
kind of like applying a soothing balm to something that's internally aching.

Oldsters like me remember the thrill of finding the latest issue of a
favourite design magazine in the mailbox, or the anticipation of a new
television episode from domestic doyenne Martha Stewart.

Many of those magazines are now dead, and home-related television has
turned into mostly contest-driven makeover shows or celebrity designers
taking on exotic projects that exist in a universe most viewers will
never inhabit.

JTHE times they are a-changing in the lives of the younger Royals.
Meghan's getting flak for her demanding ways with staff and her
stupendously expensive wardrobe, channelling the chillingly aloof Amal
Clooney.

Harry, thank goodness, is still the nation's favourite boy. But there
are worrying signs of an emerging preachy young prig, informing the
*millennial* generation that they should tell us oldies where to get
off, thereby rescuing the planet, while gaily jumping into helicopters
and private planes at the drop of a hat.

For wine drinkers the length and breadth of the country, Majestic Wine

when it first opened, it bridged the gap between the indies and the
supermarkets; and it did so with style, offering attractive bottles at
affordable prices.

everyone's talking about

Why? You've heard of Big Tobacco and Big Pharma, but what about Big
Austen? It's becoming increasingly clear that all the main TV channels
and possibly most Hollywood studios are controlled by a shadowy cabal of
Jane Austen obsessives who are determined to make sure that the majority
of films and TV dramas are adaptations of Austen novels. I don't know
much about them, but I imagine they wear pastel-coloured cardigans.

*Millennial* money I used digital know-how to cut her insurance, water
and energy bills, says Adam Taylor

Earlier this year my aunt was widowed. Like many others in her
situation, managing her money wisely became imperative. In the weeks
after the funeral, letters and bills bearing her husband's name began to
arrive, reminding her not only that the world was oblivious to her
bereavement, but also that she would have to deal with tasks she had
delegated to her husband for decades.

For a growing number of my friends with small children, going out for
brunch is more trouble than it's worth: it involves leaving the house,
increasingly a challenge when having to time it around naps and feeding
schedules. Avocado is still popular, but mainly because you can mash it
up easily to spoon into a toddler.

You might still consider millennials to be a generation of young things
permanently drunk on artisan cocktails and entitlement, but sadly, the
eldest among us are careering towards 40, and our personal finances need
to catch up.

Mumbai, March 30 -- People in their twenties, breathe a sigh of relief.
But only if you belong to the majority of people who haven't figured out
their lives yet. Those who know what they're doing and where their lives
are headed, you can skip this one. Nothing for you here. But for all
those millennials who have had either parents or relatives tell them
that it is time they began (to use a *millennial* word) "adulting",
scientists at Cambridge University have a neat reply. They have found
that people don't really become adults until they reach their 30s.

There are some advantages to life in the slow lane. When you could be
living next door to one of the two neighbours from hell, veteran rock
legend Jimmy Page and pop singer (“Let me entertain you”) Robbie
Williams, sometimes it’s better to live a humbler life. An existence,
perhaps, in which your biggest concern might be the local cat that wees
in your garden or the gaping holes in communal fencing allowing foxes to
deposit half eaten jars of peanut butter on your lawn.

It's a Saturday afternoon in Dublin 4 and Colin Farrell, livelier than a
whippet with a scent of fresh meat, is here to gnaw his way through
whatever gets flung into his basket. He has flown home for the premiere
of Tim Burton's live-action remake of Dumbo. Nice work. But the grind
must get him down. What's the worst aspect of the business?

"Talking about yourself," he says without pausing. "I imagine people
look at me and think: God, he loves talking about himself - because I
seem to do it so freely. I am a much more private person than I present.
I have no desire to talk about the films. I have no desire to talk about
the characters. I have no desire to talk about myself. But if I am going
to sit down and talk, then I am going to enjoy it as much as possible."

Some has gone for nose job, some for lip and some for fat-freezing.
Indian celebrity community is a live example of what wonders cosmetic
procedures can do for one. While actors like Swara Bhaskar and Anushka
Sharma were a talk of the town after they went through cosmetic
procedures, many prefer to keep it in their closet.

Billboard’ has dropped. Titled 'Call’ the song features the
collaboration of Manj Musik and Kaur B.There’s a sweet and silly tiff
between Kaur B and Manj Musik that the song features. It’s basically a
tale every *millennial* couple can relate to.Further, the track has
music by Manj, while Nindy Kaur, Herbie Sahara Bablu Sodhi have penned
the lyrics. The former two wrote the hook and the latter worked on the
verses.

Overall, the chilled yoghurts and potted desserts sector took an extra
1.4% (£35.3m) over the past year, taking its value to £2.6bn. This
growth has come solely through price increases; volumes are down 1.1%.

Total promotions have remained flat, accounting for 46.3% of value
sales. However, the mechanics are shifting towards temporary price
reductions and away from x for y volume deals.

W hen it comes to buying your first home in Australia’s most
cosmopolitan city, you’d be forgiven for thinking you’ll have to
compromise on location to meet your budget. And with Melbourne’s inner
east currently sporting the city’s highest median apartment price at
$608,088, you may have thought the best developments were out of reach
for first-home buyers.

Panera Bread are tapping the fast-food playbook as they grapple for
growth with old-school stalwarts like McDonald’s Corp . and Burger King .

The latest evidence? The drive-thru window, a mid-20th century
innovation, is back in the limelight as chains competing for “share of

The deal[https://pipeline.thedeal.com/article/14910280/index.dl],which
includes $475 million up front, is technically nothing new for the
Ewing, N.J.-based consumer giant, but the terms of the deal, which
alsocall for an up to $425 million earnout for sales milestones by 2021,
are more complex than usual for the Arm & Hammer baking soda maker.

In January 2018, things were not going well for Gisselle Hernandez,
founder of direct-to-consumer indie makeup company Glamlite. The brand,
which was founded two months prior, was having trouble finding its
footing in the competitive beauty landscape and among the Gen-Z and
younger *millennial* target consumer group.

It was then that Hernandez began designing a new product: the Pizza
Palette, an eyeshadow palette mirroring the shape of a pizza and
featuring 18 shades, like “Marinara” and “Prosciutto.” It took $100,000
to create the palette and cost three times more to manufacture and ship
compared to a standard eyeshadow palette, said Hernandez, who declined
to share the exact cost.
