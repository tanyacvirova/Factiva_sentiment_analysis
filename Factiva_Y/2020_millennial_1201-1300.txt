When Anne Fulenwider stepped down as editor in chief of Marie Claire at
the end of last year, she eschewed all the usual post editor gigs of
book writing, consulting and lifestyle web sites. Instead, she revealed
that she would be launching a venture focused on women’s health.

The career switch raised a few eyebrows in media circles, but it may not
be as left field as one would think. At Tmrw Life Sciences, a new
fertility technology company that has digitized egg and embryo freezing
using robotics and software and raised $39 million in funding last year,
scientists have tapped three women’s media and fashion veterans to help
get its message across to the consumer.

It isn't hard to imagine a Joe Biden administration in which Kamala
Harris is vice president, Michael Bloomberg is treasury secretary, Pete
Buttigieg is homeland security secretary, Tom Steyer is climate-change
czar and Andrew Yang is commerce secretary -- or, well, maybe special
envoy for math and numbers and stuff like that.

It is, on the other hand, almost impossible to imagine a Bernie Sanders
administration in which that same group of former competitors would unite.

Nedu's day begins with a stretch of hands towards his mobile device,
then a quick flip to his Instagram responds to new messages, checks out
new followers and then making a quick post about his modelling career.
The next stop is his WhatsApp, more of his messages here is to copy and
share of a call, career news and sorts.

Most times he does not bother to check the details of the messages or
read to understand therefore he reacts to his comments and posts not
because they align with his philosophy but because of the person that
made the post. Nedu's guide to social media is the typical guide of a
*millennial* and a digital being around the world.

MY phone rang at 3.40am. It was still more Friday night than Saturday
morning.

Me and the good lady were fast asleep when the low, menacing buzz of a
phone on silent vibrate trashed the bizarre dream I was having about
travelling down the River Tyne in a 1960s vintage Hillman Imp - along
with the bassist from Kajagoogoo and some really canny North Korean
border guards.

From Flipkart to Hershey's, the Baagi 3 actress, who turns 32 today, has
a motley mix of endorsement deals.

Shraddha Kapoor is surely one of the most popular names in Bollywood
today. With at least three releases this year, the hazel-eyed actress is
raring to go. Interestingly, her beauty, talent and charisma are
restricted not only to the film industry, but also trickled down to the
advertising world. Today, the Aashiqui 2 actress turns is celebrating
her 32nd birthday with a kitty full of brands. From Lakme to Lipton Tea
and from Helo to Body Shop, Kapoor has been endorsing brands across sectors.

I don't remember when I learned that you're supposed to hold your keys
between your knuckles when you walk to your car at night. Every adult
woman I've met knows this. It doesn't matter where you're from, who your
parents are, where you went to school. We all just osmotically absorb
the awareness that vigilance is compulsory and vulnerability is
inevitable. I don't know what men do when they're not training to be
parking-lot Wolverines. Maybe they just relax? Sounds like a dream.

A more authentic, softer side to men is being reflected and celebrated
on screen in ways it never used to be. Ben Dowell gets a warm, fuzzy glow

'Are we all really this ghastly?" I said to my wife. "Men I mean." We
were watching the fourth and final series of Steve Coogan and Rob
Brydon's comedy The Trip and there was a scene in which the two central
characters, who are not strangers to competitive wisecracking, cranked
the gears up a notch to a degree that was almost unbearable.

In these modern times that Charles Chaplin would like for himself, a
certain Rodrigo Cuevas has come to disrupt all, all, all, the
avant-gardes. It's hard to find a name for his performances,his music,
his aesthetics, a cocktail of things ranging from rural paraphernalia to
cabaret, through the picaresque pin up, Freddie Mercury's tight
moustache, copla, bagpipes, electronics, agropop, salt, pepper,

News | KELNER'S VIEW

Iknow I speak for many in not knowing precisely how to feel about
coronavirus. For a start, I'm not sure how worried I should be, and what
I'm supposed to be most worried about. The collapse of the world's stock
markets and a global financial crisis? Being forced to work from home
and having minimal human contact? The postponement of sporting fixtures?
Or actually contracting the virus? In fact, at this stage, that final
threat appears to be the most remote, theoretical eventuality of all.

Environmental, social and governance investing is growing, but its
sustainability remains a concern

Green stocks are likely to become the next "mega trend in equity
markets", Saxo Bank argued in a recent report. Environmental, social and
corporate governance (ESG) investing has become mainstream, but is it a
bubble in the making? That description was used earlier this year by
JPMorgan strategist Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, who warned that investors were
not paying enough attention to company fundamentals in their rush to
improve their funds' ethical credentials. Investors' increasingly rapid
embrace of all things ESG may even be a factor in the demented rally in
the shares of electric car maker Tesla, argued MacroTourist financial
blogger Kevin Muir recently.

India, March 3 -- Millennials are getting increasingly aware and
conscious of what they put inside their bodies. No wonder, new-age chefs
are experimenting and crafting menus to provide a meaningful and healthy
food experience rich in protein, fiber and planet-friendly.

Two millenial chefs Geetika Gupta and Prashant Banerjee, both Junior
Sous Chef at Vivanta Surajkund are experimenting and reinventing
traditional techniques of cooking that resonate with the "In-house
everything" trend and presenting "Farm to Table concept" by using
ancient ingredients like amaranth, millets, oats, ragi and quinoa.

Gurugram, March 3 -- Affordable and mid-segment housing priced between
Rs.45 lakh and Rs.90 lakh is the clear choice of customers in comparison
to high-end properties across major cities in the country, says a report
released by Anarock, a real estate consultancy, on Monday.

Also, a majority of the homebuyers prefer buying 2-BHK (bedroom, hall,
kitchen) flats but their number is declining, as the number of people
who prefer 3-BHK flats is now on the rise, according to the report.

affected by rising ridership of private cabs, Metros

In the city on for a conclave on Sunday, Union civil aviation minister
Hardeep Singh Puri openly claimed that there is no economic slowdown in
India. Puri stated that the slowdown in the automobile sector cannot be
considered as indicative of the overall economic condition and further

cabs and Metro rail projects.

NEW DELHI: The hero of our story has just found a good job after
graduating. He moves into a new city with the excitement of becoming
independent. He soon discovers this truth: His life is not going to be
like that of his parents. The yardsticks of success were no longer the
same.First, his work is far from distinctive. He was one among thousands
joining the firm every year. Managers determined what had to be done,
how and when. Second, he wasn’t sure there was scope to grow. Apart from
basic communicating skills, he wasn’t sure there was learning. Third, he
felt it was tough to grow personally along with the job. The hours were
long, and the social circles limited. There was not much time for books,
music, or hikes; or energy for dates and parties. The thought of
pursuing higher studies is on his mind, but he is not sure if that would
be a value add or a waste.Fourth, the money was good to begin with. But
increments are small, and rewards for performance rare.

Recently, the all-India grand finale of the Everyuth Times Fresh Face
Season 12 saw both the male and female contestants wear clothes designed
by Narendra Kumar. The renowned designer especially created clothes and
put together their looks. He believes that clothes that are chosen by
youngsters and Gen Z are statement pieces. Talking about it Narendra
said, “The clothing most *millennial* would like to wear going ahead is
not just about clothes that make you look good, but they are are
statements by themselves and the way clothes are connected to how young
people feel today. I heard a lot of them speak and it is fantastic to
know that so many of them are so accomplished at such an young age.”
Narendra’s clothes were made to suit the different body types of the
young college students who were the finale participants. “Clothes depend
on the mind-sets of the young people today.

ROAD TEST The world’s car companies are worried about a potential
existential crisis. It’s got nothing to do with technology challenges
such as electrification. Pointy-end engineering is as intuitive to
A-grade car makers as breathing is to us.

Their big problem is that, for a whole bunch of reasons, the car is no
longer the essential coming of age accessory it was in the 20th century.
Millennials, now reaching car-buying age, aren’t doing the right thing
and signing up.

Millennials are putting their lives at risk on our roads in alarming
numbers. New research from Driver Safety Australia has found young
drivers know very little about maintaining the cars they drive.

Many don’t know the basics of checking oil and coolant, replacing
windscreen wipers or checking tyre pressure.

Nico Muhly is not an obvious choice as a composer for dance, despite a
steady stream of assignments. Though his gorgeous instrumentation and
playful if rigorous structures provide fine fodder for the choreographic
imagination, the music lacks the usual dance requirement: rhythmic
drive. But for Rotunda Justin Peck's 19th ballet for New York City
Ballet since 2012 the composer amps up the failure of forward propulsion
until it takes on a fascinating rhythm of its own.

Typical of Muhly, the score combines bursts of tootling arpeggio from
the winds with a low sustained arc of notes from the brass. Imagine
sardines eddying around a whale. Fizzled notes resemble the "second
thought" that gets you to swallow the first. Muhly disallows easy
translation from note to step: pure enticement for someone with Peck's
keen musicality and ingenuity at architecture.

Almost 820,000 farms were run by people who had other primary jobs in
2018, according to the Department of Agriculture. Recreational farms
accounted for more than 40 per cent of the total, up from 38 per cent in
2012. Equally as telling: in 2012-17 only the smallest (less than 10
acres, or 4 hectares) and the largest (2,000 acres, 800ha, or bigger)
rose in number, the agency noted.

Motorcycle maker should focus harder on drawing more overseas riders

For as long as millennials have been adults, they have been unfairly
blamed for snubbing some popular favourites of the past. Consider what
has happened to beer and breakfast cereal. But in the case of
Harley-Davidson, maker of the motorcycle brand, changing *millennial*
tastes may actually be the issue.

She had returned from traveling in Asia and felt awful, so the
25-year-old woman went to her doctor’s office in Edgewater, New Jersey.
She told the staff about her flu-like symptoms and asked whether she
might have the virus sweeping through China and causing fear of a
potential pandemic.

The staff at her primary care practice took her concerns seriously.
After all, it was Jan. 23, the first U. S. case of the novel coronavirus
had been announced only days before, and everyone was anxious. A
hospital would be better equipped to diagnose and treat her, they
reasoned, so they called an ambulance to take her to Hackensack
University Medical Center.

out among 1-year changes in the state's largest hotel market tracked by
STR of Hendersonville, Tennessee.

It's incomprehensible to me that anyone would want to leave California.
Sure, we might toy with the idea of a mansion somewhere in flyover
territory, but at the end of the day, the San Fernando Valley is home.

But apparently, leaving California is a real option for many people. We
know that out-migration is increasing, and according to a Berkeley IGS
poll, nearly 80 percent of 30- to 39-year-old Californians are thinking
about leaving the state.

The Problem: According to a Department of Labor report, demand for
diesel service technicians and mechanics is expected to grow 12% from
2014 to 2024, a pace that is faster than the average for all other
occupations.

Sixty-seven thousand diesel technicians will be needed to replace
retired workers, and 75,000 new technicians must be added to meet
additional demand by 2022, the data show.

It began with the sale of the family farm. That's what David Roswell
remembers as the moment when he first began to see himself in opposition
to his family's capitalist legacy.

Though his parents objected to the decision to relinquish the property
to developers, the extended family went ahead, selling off most of the
220 acres piecemeal starting in 1998. Roswell, then only 7 years old,
showed his displeasure by shoving rocks into the tailpipes of the
bulldozers that came to dig up the pastoral expanse outside Baltimore to
make way for new construction. He remembers watching "as this gorgeous
farm that was my everything was torn up and turned into a subdivision."
He saw it, he told me, as "a decision of people in my family to value
money over the environment, over people, over family."

The *millennial* demographic is finally starting to pay off student
loans, buy houses and save money. They’re accumulating wealth and
depending on advisors to help them invest, but in typical *millennial*
fashion, their interest goes beyond the standard stocks, bonds and other
investment instruments that advisors generally recommend. Fine art is a
commodity that appeals to the demographic, so advisors need to be able
to help explain how it can be a financial asset and wealth-building
strategy – and not just something to decorate the walls of the homes
they’re finally able to buy!

PALM SPRINGS, CA – The Land Rover Defender exited the U.S. market in
1997, a year after the last Millennials were born. So this highly
desirable target demographic has never seen a new Defender or may not be
familiar with the Land Rover model that was sold in some form throughout
their birthyears of 1983 to 1996.

Land Rover hopes to change this and capture the generation’s attention
and dollars with the ’20 Defender that debuted at the ’19 Frankfurt auto
show and goes on sale this spring. “Millennials will be the biggest
premium-car buying audience in roughly five years,” says Felix
Bräutigam, Jaguar Land Rover’s chief marketing officer, in an interview
at the brand’s recent 4xFar music and adventure festival.

The Reserve Bank says it could prevent buy now, pay later providers from
stopping merchants passing on the costs of services to customers if it
considers them a "must take" payment method from the perspective of a
retailer.

The RBA, which regulates the payments system, also appears more
concerned about "no surcharge" rules applied by buy now, pay later
operators for in-store payments because the benefits of referrals are
less clear than for online sales.

Harley-Davidson is starting the week in search of a new boss, seeking
someone who can stem years of declining sales at the iconic American
motorcycle maker just as it's starting to roll out some new products.

Chief Executive Officer Matt Levatich unexpectedly stepped down Friday,
parting ways with the board after a 26-year career at Harley-Davidson —
including five years as CEO in which the company lost more than half its
market value. Board member Jochen Zeitz will fill the job for now, the
company said after the close of business Friday.

WATERLOO REGION - When they were looking to buy a home and set down
roots, Jennifer Chenosky and her young family made the move from
Etobicoke to Kitchener last July.

The 34-year-old said the region's proximity to family members in Guelph
and London, and a wider variety of more affordable housing options
compared to what they could find in the GTA, is what drew them to their
Forest Hill neighbourhood.

The National Confectioners Association (NCA) has launched a new
data-driven research report into consumer trends, shopper insights and

into the special nature and relationship of chocolate, candy, gum and
mints in the American household.

An Edinburgh native, Anne Scott caught the hospitality bug at an early
age. She says: I was eight years old. Our family got taken out for lunch
by another family and I was the youngest person at the table. I remember
looking at the beautiful curtains and the good looking waiters with
their nice jackets and ties. I remember saying ‘Oh yeah, I'm gonna do
this. This is where I'm going to work.’ I remember that moment. My mom
just remembered that I never wanted to do anything else.”

Scott realised her wish, getting her start in F&B in banqueting and
restaurants. Stints in training and HR followed before moving back into
operations as hotel manager. For the past 15 years Scott has held the
position of general manager at several properties.

starkly different backgrounds, ideologies, strengths and weaknesses. Who
the party picks could determine the country's future.

Voting began in February 2020 with an eventual winner confirmed in July
– ready to take on Mr Trump at the election on November 3.

WATERLOO REGION - When they were looking to buy a home and set down
roots, Jennifer Chenosky and her young family made the move from
Etobicoke to Kitchener last July.

The 34-year-old said the region's proximity to family members in Guelph
and London, and a wider variety of more affordable housing options
compared to what they could find in the GTA, is what drew them to their
Forest Hill neighbourhood.

Pete Buttigieg, the 38-year-old former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who
saw a meteoric rise from virtual unknown to top-tier contender and
became the first openly gay candidate to make a high-profile
presidential run, ended his campaign Sunday as he confronted the reality
that his prospects of victory had all but collapsed.

Buttigieg's decision came shortly before Super Tuesday, the biggest
primary day of the year, at a time when the Democratic race shows signs
of becoming a race between Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and former vice
president Joe Biden, with Biden occupying a centrist position that
Buttigieg had hoped to make his own.

"We're looking to buy a house ASAP," Emily said. What's the rush? The

Many people in both major parties have soured on the presidential
primary system. In 2016, the Democratic contest was riven by bitter
arguments over whether the Democratic National Committee had put a thumb
on the scale for Hillary Clinton in her race against Sen. Bernie Sanders
(I-Vt.). Meanwhile, Donald Trump's ascent revealed the inability of a
major party to prevent a celebrity non-politician from hijacking the
system and securing its nomination. (Republicans ultimately made their
peace with that outcome.) This year's Democratic primary race has hardly
impressed observers as a model of candidate selection, either: It's
featured a multibillionaire who skipped the first four states, the early
winnowing of all nonwhite candidates, shouty debates and a failure of
the party's moderate wing to settle on one person.

South Bend, Indiana, got its former mayor back and America lost its
first LGBTQ presidential candidate on Sunday when Pete Buttigieg dropped
out of the 2020
race[https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2020/03/01/pete-buttigieg-suspends-presidential-campaign-2020-nr-vpx.cnn].

The move surprised some because of both Buttigieg's strong showing in
Iowa and New Hampshire and the outsized media focus he's enjoyed over
the past year as the country got to know the first out gay candidate
vying for the highest office in American history. Pundits noted that his
bid fell victim to dwindling campaign
funds[https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/P00010298/]. It's possible that
the 38-year old ex-mayor from a city in a flyover state never expected
to go this far on the national stage. Many LGBTQ Americans, including
myself, were surprised as well, precisely because he is gay.

It’s always been one of the quickest and easiest ways to rate things: on
a scale of 1 to 10.

At a session at the Truckload Carriers Association’s annual meeting near
Orlando on March 1, Tim Hindes, the CEO of recruiting and
retention-focused StayMetrics, laid out that scale in response to how
different generations and worker classifications might respond to the
question: How grateful should you be to have your job as a truck driver?

A preservation group is accusing Mayor de Blasio of political patronage
after one of his donors was allowed to build a controversial new hotel
near Manhattan's Union Square - and now the city is pushing to limit
other new hotels from sprouting up nearby.

The city's new proposal would require hotel builders to get a special
permit for new projects in the area roughly between 14th and Ninth Sts.
and Third Ave. and University Place.

Searching for academic information beyond the enlocated Google,
interacting as in class, but virtualally making self-edited audiovisual
shorts to teach demonstrate that the use of Information and
Communication Technologies (ICTs) stages a new landscape in the
classroom and gradually changes the profile of teachers and students.
But, most importantly, it gives several advantages beyond how attractive
a device or app can be. What are the real benefits?

The Director of Virtual Education at the Universidad Privada del Valle,
Aaron Rioja, emphasizes that the use of technology in the classroom
brings several advantages in academic terms such as: time savings,
student motivation and better understanding of concepts. However, it
clarifies that this is possible as long as ICTs are accompanied by good
pedagogy. "At the end of the module and/or semester, technology will
continue to be one more medium, not an end," he adds.

Onno Bouwmeister, Global Sector Head - Private Equity at Vistra, writes
an open letter to the PE industry about the major role it could play in
driving the ESG agenda.

As the great and good gathered at the 50th World Economic Forum in
Davos, Switzerland, earlier this year, there was one dominant theme on
the agenda - the climate crisis. From a damning speech by 17-year-old
climate activist Greta Thunberg, to panels featuring the C-suite of some
of the world's largest businesses - including the likes of Coca-Cola and
Dow Chemical - issues centred on the environment and sustainability
stole all the headlines.

PHYLLIS BLUMBERG is president of a Main Line Philadelphia synagogue,
someone who has spent a lifetime practicing and contemplating Jewish
values. She thinks she’ll probably campaign for Mike Bloomberg.

But she admits her son, Noah, 27, has been trying to make the case to
her for Bernie Sanders.

If you were lucky enough to own one in the Nineties, now is the time to
dig it out again.

There's a scene in the TV series Sex and the City in which lead
character Carrie Bradshaw (played by Sarah Jessica Parker) is mugged at
gunpoint. "Give me your bag," orders the assailant. "It's a Baguette!"
she wails, before reluctantly handing over her small, purple-sequinned
purse.
