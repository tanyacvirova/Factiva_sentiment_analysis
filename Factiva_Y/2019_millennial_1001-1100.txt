SNS Web, Mar-14 In India, about 440 million are millennials, and they
form 46% of the current workforce, with 91% millennials making their own
financial decisions. Unlike their previous counterparts, millennials
have a better understanding of their responsibilities. For them,
‘standard of living’ holds a different connotation, and they are
constantly working towards fulfilling it.

The social fabric of India is at the center of a transition where people
are recalibrating their approach towards time and investments. Due to a
proclivity towards nuclear families, increase in purchasing power of
millennials and the high penetration of internet, Indians today are
becoming more ‘Leisure Conscious’ and taking a breather to spend and
focus on their own leisure.

SNS Web, Mar-14 Surely you’ve heard of the stereotypes? Of quiet and
antisocial millennials who can’t look you in the eye. Dubbed the "Me
Generation", millennials have got a bad rap for being lazy, entitled and
too engrossed with their smartphones to truly connect with those around
them — but these stereotypes may not actually be the reality.

More than 70 per cent of startup founders in India are under 35 years —
that’s the most in the world. Millennials account for over half the
country’s population. By 2020, millennials will form 50% of the global
workforce. They are the most ethnically, racially and socially diverse
generation and they have more college degrees than any previous
generations. They value independence, collaboration and integrity. Most
of all, they can't tolerate boredom; they want to be challenged by their
work and by their leaders. So what does all this mean for employers?

Arrivals from Europe to the GCC will increase 29 per cent over the
period 2018 to 2023, driven by new and direct flight routes, a growing
number of *millennial* and middle-class travellers and competitive air
fares, according to the latest data released ahead of Arabian Travel
Market (ATM) 2019, which takes place at Dubai World Trade Centre from
April 28-May 1, 2019.

According to ATM's research partner, Colliers International, as many as
8.3 million EU residents will travel to the GCC in 2023, an additional
1.9 million travellers when compared to 2018 arrival figures.

ALTHOUGH the 2019 India-Pakistan standoff may have passed its immediate
intensity, it is clear that the entire episode has left a slew of new
worries for policymakers all over the world. It is crucial that lessons
are learnt and crisis-handling procedures between the two countries put
in place. Because there is no doubt that Pakistan and India were
perilously close to war.

In a digital age, resonating with the red noise of alternative facts
fuelled by ultra-nationalisms, it was clear that the Modi regime's need
to bolster its flagging electoral ratings before an election took the
Indian act of border incursion into Pakistan's Balakot to act of war
status. The second motivation was the impulse to divert attention from
the growing insurgency in India-held Kashmir.

WHO says Fridays get all the fun? Whether its entrepreneurial clients or
*millennial* lawyers driving the change, law firms are increasingly
putting the casual in business casual.

Dechert is the latest firm to expand its definition of acceptable
workplace attire. Management at the firm announced Tuesday a new
business casual dress code that means lawyers and staff can now wear
jeans any day of the week, if they so choose.

This week I’ve been forced to face my own mortality. I’m not ill, to my
knowledge. No near-death experiences have occurred, no bright lights to
walk towards. Instead, I got an email at work asking me to supply the
name and contact information of the person I would like to receive a
payout in the event of my death.

Cheery, right? I pondered who I should put down on what, I realised, is
the closest thing to a last will and testament that I have written to
date. It was quite a reality check to face before my morning coffee.

Whether you are a Leaver or a Remainer, everyone can surely agree that
there should be more to life than Brexit. The drama of the negotiations
in Brussels — and the immediate crisis in Parliament — should not blind
us to the fact that there are other policy issues that affect people’s
lives every single day. They matter as much, if not more, as the terms
of our departure from the EU.

High up on the list of Londoners’ concerns is the acute shortage of
homes. The capital’s jobs market has been booming for decades but the
supply of new homes has not kept up. Between 2000 and 2018 London’s
population increased by more than1.5 million people and the number of
jobs increased by more than 1.2 million. In the same period just 452,000
homes were built in the capital. This is nowhere near enough.

Guelph, March 14, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Few public documents are as
universally recognized as Canada’s Food Guide. In fact, preliminary
findings of a study conducted by Dr. Sylvain Charlebois, Senior Director
at the Dalhousie University Agrifood Analytics Lab and the University of
Guelph, show that 91% of Canadians are aware of the Food Guide and 74%
know that the Government of Canada recently published a new
version.Canada’s Food Guide: Canadians’ Awareness, Understanding, and
Barriers to Adoption and Affordability is a study released jointly by
Dalhousie University and the University of Guelph. The new Food Guide is
a substantial departure from the previous version, focusing on
plant-based eating and doing away with the four food groups most
Canadians have grown up with.Are the new Food Guide recommendations
affordable?

Esther's joyously irreverent take on ageing spurred readers to share
their own witty little signs that you're heading over the hill!

WHEN, a few weeks ago, I wrote in Femail about the odd signs of ageing
that have taken me by surprise - fat earlobes, for one - I never
expected it to strike such a chord.

You’re a multimillion-dollar business with a loyal following and you’ve
just paid a top-tier agency to rebrand your business. The ‘journey’ has
lasted four months and incurred costs upwards of $250,000. You’ve been
through three rounds of stakeholder engagement, two moodboard sessions
and a four-page questionnaire in the name of a ‘perception audit’.

The day rolls around for the reveal; the boardroom is filled with key
faces. After a weak cup of tea, some small-talk and an incredibly
earnest rationale, the agency unveils a logo which appears to have been
typed out from a keyboard in a rather unspectacular sans-serif font. It
mimics the logos of at least six major corporations you can name off the
top of your head; as a matter of fact, it looks just like the agency’s
logo as well.

NEW DELHI, March 14 -- Are the sales of the cosmetic hair care industry
growing at the cost of your hair loss? According to an AC Neilson Study,
the hair care industry has a hair-raising base of '22,500 crore. While
its sales count has grown and thickened, your hair count just never did.

About 50% of men suffer from some degree of male pattern baldness by the
age of 50. Nearly 20 million women have significant hair loss at some
point in their lives. A survey reveals that as many as 75% of all women
think that balding men look less attractive and that 14% more men with
full heads of hair were selected for job interviews as compared to men
with lesser hair (Source: Hair - Everything you ever wanted to know by
Dr Akshay Batra).

Millennials aren't the only ones using dating apps. A growing number of
middle-aged Indians is swiping to find love, friendship, and everything
in between

It was Meena's son who convinced her to use Tinder to look for a
romantic partner. The 52-year-old Kolkata doctor had been separated from
her husband for almost 15 years. "I am tech challenged and didn't even
know what Tinder was," Meena recalls. Her son taught her how to swipe
left or right and 'like' potential matches. After chatting with some men
for a few months, and even meeting one, she found Alok - a divorcee in
his 50s. "Today, I'm really happy having him in my life but both of us
are clear we don't want to get married," she adds.

Chennai: The top seven Indian cities collectively saw average apartment
sizes shrink by nearly 17 per cent between 2014 and 2018. On an average
apartments have become smaller from 1390 sq ft in 2014 to 1100 sq ft in
2018.

In order to make housing projects more pocket-friendly for a higher
customer base, developers are shrinking the sizes of the apartments,
finds Anarock Property Consultants.

Builders in Calcutta have cut the average size of apartments by almost a
quarter over the past five years to fit the budget of buyers as the real
estate industry continue to face a sale slump and price freeze.

The city only trailed the Mumbai Metropolitan region among all major
cities in India to give up expansive apartments at the altar of compact
development as developers try to strike a fine balance between
aspiration and affordability, a study by Anarock Property Consultants
showed.

restaurants across 11 cities, thereby generating a total GMV worth of Rs
350 crores for the restaurant partners. Interestingly, 80% of the diners
turned out to be between the age group of 18-34 years, while Delhi
topped the charts where around 30% of the total diners enjoyed meals and
deals at the festival.“This year, GIRF has captured the imagination of

Krackjack and Monaco get a brand refresh as the company looks to carve a
wider niche in the crackers market and build its *millennial* credentials

At 50 and 75 years, Krackjack and Monaco are among the oldest brands in
the Parle pack. And for that reason alone, one would assume, unlikely
contenders for *millennial* attention. However the two brands are
leading the company’s charge into the demographic and driving Parle’s
efforts to expand its footprint in the ~5000-crore-plus market for crackers.

Bata’s image and product makeover seem to be paying off

About two years ago, Bata India reintroduced itself as a trendy
accessories brand shedding what was, by then, over a century-old image
of being the footwear choice for formal occasions. While this new
chapter in the company’s history is too recent to gauge the overall
impact of the transformation exercise, the initial response appears to
be positive as most numbers compare favourably to the preceding years.

India, March 14 -- Breaking the myth about eco-friendly materials, and
also emphasising the need for utilisation of green fabrics, FDCI's Lotus
Make-up India Fashion Week set out to give a message on sustainable fashion.

The ramp set in the green background with elements of flora and fauna,
the show featured collection by designers Rina Dhaka, Sahil Kochhar,
Shalini James and Samant Chauhan. The show reconciled sustainability
with the fashion industry, ethics and responsibility with beauty, luxury
and comfort with style and elegance, shattering the myth of sustainable
clothing by being boxy, stylishly-textured, and fashionable while highly
breathable.

The number of exchange traded fund investors in Australia has surged to
a record high in a trend tipped to continue as the industry becomes more
mainstream.

By October last year, 385,000 people were investing in ETFs, up 20 per
cent for the year, according to an annual survey released yesterday by
ETF provider BetaShares.

Outside forces corral juvenile groupthink in an effort to chip away at
the West

“You are not mature enough to tell it like it is. Even that burden, you
leave to us children. But I don’t care about being popular. I care about
climate justice and the living planet.” These are the words of Greta
Thunberg, a 15-year-old Swedish student who last year, according to CNN,
“shamed” negotiators at the UN climate summit in Katowice, Poland.

WHILE 2018 was all about Scandi-inspired minimalism and *millennial*
pink, this year we’re seeing a shift towards a busier, brighter vibe for
interiors and homewares. It’s time to experiment with a toolbox of paint
colours outside of whites and greys, opting for an impact pigment.

CORAL For a home that screams 2019, try adding hints of Pantone’s colour
of the year, living coral to the confines of your four walls. Pantone
cited living coral as a colour of carefree happiness, saying that it
“symbolises our innate need for optimism and joyful pursuits”, a feeling
that people might be craving in today’s landscape. Although it may seem
slightly more pink than orange, Pantone described living coral as “an
animated, life-affirming shade of orange, with golden undertones.”

Turns out some people really need to be more selfish. They give it all
away — their time, their support, their soul — and frequently to those
who don't deserve such valuable goods. Often, of course, those who ought
to take more for themselves, those afraid to risk being perceived as
shrill, are women who've been bred on inequality and submission.

And heavy women? If you judge by our aspirational culture, they're lucky
to have the chance to deny their needs for some loser guy.

In a recent letter (March 6), Eamonn Dundon suggests that the University
of Southern Maine should consider banning and expelling the Confucius
Institute.

The writer probably has been influenced by various statements of Sen.
Mitt Romney and other lawmakers warning about the Confucius Institutes,
even including claims that the teachers are treacherous spies, etc.

Womanist theology and how it has evolved

IN 1985, while presenting her essay "The Emergence of Black Feminist
Consciousness" to a room filled almost entirely with white theologians
at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Religion, Katie Geneva
Cannon fainted. It's little wonder she was nervous. Hers was the first
paper ever presented on womanist theology at the AAR, and it was a
daring and dangerous proposition at the time. In the theological academy
until the 1980s, as black feminist Akasha Gloria Hull notes, "all the
women were white and all the blacks were men."

They can contain anger at the market system by making pragmatic
concessions to it

In a country where “liberalism” means big government and
“neoconservatism” implies utopian derring-do, the mangling of another
abstract noun was probably due. What US politics has done to “
socialism” over recent months is no less regrettable for that.

Hiroshima, Japan, as the Unique Clothing Warehouse—an ironic name for a
manufacturer known for clothing that is in no way unique. A person can
dress sock-to-cardigan in the company’s wares without announcing herself
as a devotee of the brand. In an industry as label-oriented as fashion,
such anonymity would seem to be a detriment to success. Today, however,
Uniqlo has more than 2,000 stores in 15 countries. Its owner, Tadashi
Yanai, is the richest person in Japan. Its parent company, Fast
Retailing, is among the five largest clothing retailers in the world.

American streetwear fans interested in expanding their wardrobes can now
shop another up-and-coming global brand that’s bowing a dedicated
e-commerce website designed for the U.S. market.

INXX, the Chinese label for millennials that’s “fusing the major

Casual Friday? Try casual Monday through Friday.

As the modern U.S. workplace evolves, one thing many office managers
have in common is that they are throwing the traditional business dress
code out the window.

Millennials have been reluctant to say yes to homeownership.
Affordability, high student loan debt and tighter lending practices have
prevented many of them from jumping off the fence into the housing market.

While homeownership for millennials — the largest generation in U.S.
history — is lower than that of their parents and grandparents, they are
now hitting their prime homebuying years. They’re in their 30s, marrying
and having children — and looking to buy a new home.

Adam Cahill, the founder and CEO of agency Anagram, has had a simple
philosophy since he founded his business three years ago: Let people
work the way they want to. The company is inspired by a Swedish model of
six-hour workdays and has unlimited vacation. But Cahill wanted to do
more, and recently, inspired by the rash of news around long hours and
the effect they have on mental health, instituted an after-hours
communication ban across the company. It’s simple: No email, no Slack
during evenings and on weekends. (Barring emergencies, of course.)

“This idea that everyone has to be on all the time and can’t leave is
counterproductive. People feel pressured to be at work. That’s silly to
me,” said Cahill. “We wanted to do something specific and simple. And so
we just made it a rule.”

Last week US bank BNY Mellon informed its employees it was “pausing” a
review of its policies that allow them to work from home. But what are
the implications if HR decides to change or scrap an existing policy,
and how should they go about it? Andrea London explains.

We have all heard the terms “flexible working” and “agile working”. In
the past decade they are increasingly synonymous with the *millennial*
culture and a step towards obtaining that elusive work-life balance.

Gross class privilege, the repression of meritocracy and the hypocrisy
of supporting affirmative action are just a few of the concerns raised
by Opinion readers since Tuesday’s college admissions scandal broke. We
received more than 4,000 comments on our coverage, which included Frank
Bruni’s column, “Bribes to Get Into Yale and Stanford? What Else Is
New?[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/opinion/college-bribery-admissions.html],”
the Editorial, “Turns Out There’s a Proper Way to Buy Your Kid a College

The U.S. might be known for its consumerism, but the major challenges
facing brands today tend to be universal. Case in point: At the SXSW
festival, which officially ends Sunday, an international audience
crammed into the Australia House for a packed session on how brands can
tap into or create community.

And, the speakers said, what inspires community around a brand —
particularly among the *Millennial* and Gen Z set — is a sense of purpose.

New Delhi, March 13 -- When Shailendra Tatia interviewed for a job with
Azim Premji-funded iD Fresh Food (India) Pvt. Ltd two years ago, it was
at the startup's office-cum factory in suburban Bengaluru's Whitefield
area. Tatia landed the job and the company moved soon after to The Hive,
a 100,000 square feet (sq. ft) shared working space inside the upscale
VR Bengaluru shopping mall, making the retail
zone-cum-hangout-spot-cum-plug-and-play office into its corporate
headquarters.

"In a workplace like this, we get a lot of insight because you are
working (in the same space) with other companies. When we launch a
product, there is a ready sample of consumers, across age groups, for
feedback," said Tatia, general manager, marketing and new product
development, at iD Fresh. "Most importantly, the flexibility, culture
and open space create room for a constant exchange of ideas," he added.

Prof. Kim Ran-do talks about the top 10 trends of 2019 during his
lecture in Seoul on Tuesday. Courtesy of CICIBy Dong Sun-hwaKnowing of
the trends in advance is a key to getting ahead in life. And if you want
a clue for what this year has in store, ask Seoul National University's
Prof. Kim Ran-do, Korea's best-known consumer behavior scholar.Kim's
answer for the top 10 trends of 2019 would be “PIGGY DREAM.” You may
guess as much, this year being the lucky Year of the Golden Pig. If you
draw a blank after that, you should listen to his lecture or buttonhole
him if you can. I did both at an event hosted by the Korea CQ Forum of
the Corea Image Communication Institute (CICI), a global culture
promotion advocacy. “P” stands for “Play the concept,” Kim said,
explaining that each of 10 letters in PIGGY DREAM stands for one trend
in a phrase or sentence, while the all-captialized phrase is his way of
paying respect to the lucky animal of the Korean Zodiac.

PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — The families ensnared in the college bribery
scandal embody wealth and privilege in America: CEOs, Hollywood stars,
Wall Street millionaires. A California vineyard owner. A prominent
Manhattan lawyer.

If they're villains, they're villains made to order for a time
preoccupied with deep divisions of class, privilege and race — a time
when many regular Americans often feel they have no chance of getting
ahead in a system that's engineered in favor of the richest of the rich.

It’s dangerous to depend on the government’s promises to take care of
you in old age.

That’s because Social Security trustees recently said the program will
run out of money in a few decades. This worries workers who will be
depending on Social Security.

Millennials make up the largest cohort of homebuyers, but they may not
be living up to their potential, which could be an opportunity for
mortgage lenders to help them enter the housing market.

Mortgage companies continue pushing digital mortgage tools and offerings
to attract younger customers, and while that's important, they could be
grazing past other concepts like providing more opportunities for education.

The Buffalo Niagara region’s proximity to Canada and especially Toronto
could be a huge advantage for commercial real estate here and regional
leaders should take better advantage of that.

Spencer Levy, chairman of America’s Research Group Ltd. and CBRE senior
economic adviser, made that observation when he met March 6 with 40
development and commercial real estate executives. He told them that
areas such as Buffalo Niagara should be on the radar of international
investors.

There’s more than one raisin grower in California, but name recognition
goes to Sun-Maid Growers, a privately-owned farmer’s cooperative made up
of close to a thousand growers who farm 50,000 acres of raisin grapes in
central California. Located in the heart of the San Joaquin Valley’s
raisin producing district, Sun-Maid products are distributed throughout
the U.S. and in more than 50 countries around the world.

It’s a unique growing area because its long and dry summers are optimal
for grape production and natural sun-drying of grapes into raisins.

Two of my children were born in socialist France. They survived. In
fact, their births were great experiences: excellent medical care,
wonderful postnatal follow-up, near-zero cost. My son’s bris, in a Paris
deserted through the August exodus, was another story, but I won’t get
into that. France has one of the world’s most elaborate social
protection systems. The ratio of tax revenue to gross domestic product,
at 46.2 per cent, is the highest of all Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development countries. In the United States, that ratio
is 27.1pc.

CITY OF MEXICO (Expansion). - The gyms got in shape in 2014, when sports
chains began to position themselves in the Mexican market. Five years
later, before the consolidation of the fitness culture, these
established companies concentrate on offering specialized services and
expanding their sporting offer. "We went from being a traditional
industry to a completely innovative one. We are migrating to a more
efficient concept for our clients, in which we not only offer sports
services, we help them improve their quality of life with programs
focused on the prevention of diseases ", explains Fernando Guzmán,
commercial director of Sports World, It has 60 centers in 17 states of
the country. One of the challenges is to stay in a country where 57.6%
of the population does not perform any physical activity, according to
INEGI.

Sleep - the final frontier of a *millennial* lifestyle centred around

is not something we can do without. Yet.

Last week US bank BNY Mellon informed its employees it was reversing its
policy on allowing them to work from home. But what are the implications
if HR decides to scrap an existing policy, and how should they go about
it? Andrea London explains.

We have all heard the terms “flexible working” and “agile working”. In
the last decade they are increasingly synonymous with the *millennial*
culture and a step towards obtaining that elusive work-life balance.
