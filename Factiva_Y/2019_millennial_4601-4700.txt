PLEASANTON, Calif. — *Millennial* homebuyers are taking out larger
FHA-backed mortgage loans year-over-year, according to November data
from the Ellie Mae *Millennial* Tracker™. Twenty-six percent of all
closed loans to members of the generation in November were for FHA
loans, with an average loan size of $186,454, up from $178,862 in
November 2017 and $170,167 in November 2016. Comparatively, Conventional
loans accounted for 69 percent of closed loans made to *Millennial*
borrowers during the same period, with an average loan amount of
$211,268. Additionally, two percent of loans were for VA loans and three
percent were unspecified.

FHA loans were more likely to be used by borrowers to purchase a home
(95 percent), with just five percent of these type of loans going toward
a refinance. Among conventional loans, 88 percent were for purchases and
11 percent were for refinances.

Assuming they read newspapers!...

Well. Spotted and how! No, you aren't browsing through Yatra's insta
page. It's a front page advert in today's TOI (Mumbai), in which the
brand looks like it's trying hard to speak *Millennial* tongue. Through
this print ad, the OTA brand tries to push an acronym towards the reader
- YBOF(Yatra Big Outing Fest).

Social networking and hookup app Grindr is folding its digital magazine
as it joins countless other publishers in a thankless pivot to video.
Grindr launched the magazine, Into, about a year and a half ago as a way
to reach LGBTQ readers with a following it had already attracted with
the app. The Advocate first reported the
news.[https://www.advocate.com/business/2019/1/15/grindr-axes-staff-lgbtq-publication-mass-layoff?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=business]


“The company will be refocusing its efforts on video and as such, the
editorial and social teams were let go this morning,” a statement from
the Into team said.

Arts lovers looking for a bit of festival buzz in the cold of winter
should get on down to Factory Theatre, where the Toronto Fringe's Next
Stage Festival is playing through Sunday (heated beer tent and all).

Unlike the Fringe, which selects shows by lottery, Next Stage is
curated, this year with a particular interest in national
representation, says artistic director Lucy Eveleigh: four of the dozen
shows come from beyond the GTA. Over a packed weekend's viewing, I was
able to catch half the program.

A survey from the Empower Institute reveals retirement industry terms
employees prefer, what they want communications look like, and how they
prefer to receive them.

Employees need to understand their retirement plan options so they can
make the best decisions for their future, but the general public often
misunderstands words that are commonly used by financial providers,
employers and others in the retirement planning industry, Empower finds.

NEW YORK - A Gillette ad for men invoking the #MeToo movement is
sparking intense online backlash, with accusations that it talks down to
men and groups calling for a boycott. But Gillette says it doesn't mind
sparking a discussion. Since it debuted Monday, the Internet-only ad has
garnered nearly 19 million views on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter - a
level of buzz that any brand would covet.

The two-minute ad from Procter & Gamble's razor brand shows men and boys
engaging in bullying and sexual harassment and encourages men to "say
the right thing" and "act the right way." Taking on bullying, sexual
harassment and toxic masculinity is a big task for a razor brand. Many
critics took to social media saying it was insulting to men and laden
with stereotypes.

Boohoo’s festive sales rise might have allayed investor fears that it
was going to repeat Asos’s shock profit warning, but the
*millennial*-focused fashion brand is stoking a wider debate about the
bigger cost of fast fashion. Few fashion retailers can afford to sell
dresses for £5 a pop. The question is should they even be trying?

The rise of social media has meant fashion has become even more
disposable, with younger customers saying that once a picture of their
outfit has appeared on Instagram, or Snapchat, they don’t want to wear
it again. Previously the only dress women would boast about wearing just
once would be their wedding dress. Now, a shopper can order a dress
online and have it delivered in time for the following night out.

Although some *millennial* residents of the District and its inner
suburbs have left the area in search of affordability or job
opportunities, the majority plan to stay in the city. That's according
to a recent survey by ULI Washington, which is part of the Urban Land
Institute, a nonprofit education and research organization.

Those millennials who move out of the area appear to be quickly replaced
by young people new to Washington.

From quickie boosts of Botox and filler to surgical nips and tucks, the
youth-seeking Hollywood crowd has practically every anti-aging treatment
at its disposal. But for those who prefer to age au naturel,
insider-beloved skin tool brand Skin Gym[https://www.skingymco.com/] —
responsible for those crystal facial rollers that are all over Instagram
— is the latest to offer a needle-and-knife-free face-lift like option
in Los Angeles, just in time for awards season beauty prep.

The L.A.-based company recently opened its first, *millennial* pink-hued
retail space and "facial workout" studio, Skin
Camp[http://www.skincamp.co/], in Beverly Grove and supermodel Kaia
Gerber has already been spotted there.

The divorce court judge was frustrated. The husband, in tears. The wife,
adamant. The couple's love for each other had ended, but each professed
to love and want the dog. How would the judge decide? The husband
offered thousands of dollars to his soon-to-be-ex for the pit bull
terrier mix named Sweet Pea. The wife wouldn't accept the compensation,
and insisted the dog was hers --- a gift, in fact, from her husband.
"This was a mutt they got at the pound, and it wasn't worth money," said
family attorney Erin Levine of Oakland, California, who represented the
husband and said the judge gave her grief for not settling the dispute
out of court in the 2015 case. "There was no way we weren't going to
litigate this; they were so attached to the dog." The woman produced a
greeting card from her husband saying "This [dog] is your gift for
Christmas. I love you." Finally, the judge gave her custody of Sweet
Pea. Her husband, Levine remembered in an interview, was inconsolable.

Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer didn't do any favors for Joe Biden with
their televised response to President Donald Trump's immigration speech
last week.

Pelosi in particular has drawn praise since the mid-term election for
her skillful maneuvering to secure the House speakership and her
aggressive jousting with Trump during the government shutdown. But the
stiff and widely panned televised response from the two leaders -- an
instant target for late-night comics -- quickly reopened questions about
whether the Democrats' national leadership is too old. That's not a
helpful backdrop for Biden, 76, as he nears a decision on whether to
seek the party's presidential nomination for 2020.

E-mail security provider Zix Corp. (Nasdaq: ZIXI) is buying
cybersecurity company AppRiver from Marlin Equity Partners for $275
million. True Wind Capital is also investing $100 million in convertible
preferred equity. The target serves more than 60,000 companies, offering
e-mail and web protection services. "The acquisition helps us expand our
customer base, enhance our advanced threat protection position, and
accelerate our high-velocity go-to-market strategy through AppRiver’s
numerous and longstanding channel partnerships," says Zix CEO David
Wagner. "Email is typically the first application that gets moved to the
cloud, and this acquisition puts us squarely at the beginning of our
customers’ cloud migration." Demand for new and improved cybersecurity
offerings, in some cases spurred by well-publicized data breaches and
ransomware attacks, has created a healthy appetite for M&A with
cybersecurity-related companies. BlackBerry Ltd.

Kong, with entities such as Mofang, Nova, Ziroom and Weave, this
investment represents the first co-living platform which the firm has
backed in India. An affiliate of Warburg Pincus and Lemon Tree Hotels
Limited will hold 68 per cent and 30 per cent stake, respectively in the
JV, with the balance 2 per cent to be held by Patanjali (Patu) Keswani,
founder, chairman and managing director, Lemon Tree Hotels Limited.

MILAN — As Mario Grauso, president of Holt Renfrew, put it, men can say
goodbye to a small coat closet.

In Milan, brands showed terrific outerwear pieces that appealed to
retailers, from coats to bomber jackets, long puffers and parkas. In
sync with London’s runways, there was a shift toward tailoring, now
developed in softer and deconstructed ways. Textures were key and animal
prints were a must, as well as corduroy.

Almost a third of homebuyers would have pulled out of a property
transaction if they had known the true cost of it, a survey has found.

Research from digital conveyancing platform When You Move found 8.5
million (31 per cent) homebuyers felt they had been blindsided by the
true extent of the transaction cost, including surveys and conveyancer
fees, with 28 per cent saying they would have exited the transaction had
they been allowed to at that point.

When was the last time scrolling through Instagram made you feel better?

If you're like me, the puppy photos on your feed momentarily boost your
mood, but the parade of carefully selected and artfully edited
experiences leaves you feeling depleted. How can these people afford to
travel to New Zealand? When will it be your turn to road trip along the
Pacific Coast Highway, drinking wine on sunlit rooftops along the way?

Whiskers were so popular in the 19th century that even women wanted to
grow sideburns, a historian has revealed after finding old adverts for
grooming products.

Men began wearing fake sideburns in the early 1800s to join the
"whiskered mania" which engulfed England - and spurred a thriving market
for lotions and potions to care for facial hair.

It was the short story that captured the mood of #MeToo and became a
viral sensation, now Kristen Roupenian's first book is on the way. Does
it live up to the hype, asks Katie Law

IF YOU live or work in any of the hipper parts of south London, prepare
to be assaulted next month by the sight of bright shiny foil-covered
billboards declaring "You Know You Want This" in huge letters. They're
just a small part of one of the biggest publicity campaigns ever mounted
for a book of short stories — Kristen Roupenian's debut collection of
the same name.

CARIBBEAN chain Elegant Hotels today praised its largest shareholder,
serial entrepreneur Luke Johnson, as it revealed sales growth.

Elegant Hotels' boss Sunil Chatrani said of 12.5% shareholder Johnson
(who is grappling with an accounting scandal at his Patisserie Valerie
bakery empire): "He has been a great addition to the team and
shareholders." The AIM-listed firm, which runs seven hotels in Barbados,
said revenue rose 5% to $62.9 million (£48.9 million) in the year to
September 30.

As road transport becomes increasingly shared, connected, intelligent,
automated and electrified, it must enter a new age of systems
engineering complexity.

Much as it was with video phones, wearable technology and hover boards
from Back to the Future II, it is difficult for some to imagine that one
day we will have shared, connected, cooperative and automated vehicles.
But as technology progresses at an amazing pace, we are finding that we
are actually far too conservative in our visions.

Research points to vast differences between Millennials and Generation Z

SAN FRANCISCO and NASHVILLE, Tenn., Jan. 15, 2019 /PRNewswire/ --
Generation Z, which is comprised of today's youth and young adults, has
received little attention compared to the *Millennial* generation. Yet,
those in Generation Z are among our youngest consumers, students,
colleagues, constituents, voters, and neighbors. Being able to better
understand who they are and how they see the world can be helpful in
effectively working with, teaching, supervising, and leading them.

Whether or not you subscribe to the view that today's youth are an
entitled, smashed avocado-eating, device-obsessed group, it won't be
that long before they move from being just consumers to being investors.
And this they will do very differently from their parents and grandparents.

It seems these investors of tomorrow will have a more of a social
conscience.

Luxury cosmetics firm L'Occitane International SA agreed to buy beauty
and skincare brand Elemis for about $900 million, as the maker of
organic lotions looks to expand in the U.S. and U.K. with its biggest
deal on record.

Hong Kong-listed L'Occitane agreed to buy Elemis from Steiner Leisure
Ltd., a portfolio company of private equity firm L Catterton that
focuses on consumer investments. The deal is the latest in a spate of
acquisitions of high-end skincare brands, with demand for natural beauty
products on the rise in Asia, a trend that has also lifted cosmetics
giant L'Oreal SA.

The streaming giant is trying to corner the market in ‘elder
entertainment’ – and with shows packed with sex toys and jaw-dropping
Danny DeVito scenes, they’re having a blast doing it

The return of Grace and Frankie this week is heartening for fans, not
least those who might expect them to be dead. After all, the Netflix
series (now number five) follows the travails of two elderly
chalk-and-cheese women, who have been lumped together after they
discover their husbands were locked in a decades-long gay affair. But
this cruel assumption would be to misunderstand one of the key aspects
of modern old age – namely, that it seems to go on for ever – as well as
the power of the show, its stars, Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin, and indeed
its distributor. Age has not withered them, and they are sustained by
Netflix’s infinite variety.

In Ocasio-Cortez we see what it might look like for left to retake
control – to begin talking about what we want to talk about rather than
whatever Trump is spewing

The answer to the question “Who’s afraid of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez?”
is establishment Democrats in Congress, apparently. A recent Politico
report[https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/11/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-democrats-establisment-1093728]
says that fellow House members are worried she will “unleash a tweet at
them”, and are “afraid” of her stinging public criticisms of Democrats.

CRE 2019: Opportunities abound amidst strong demand, anticipated
repricing and strategic change

TORONTO, Jan. 15, 2019 /CNW/ - Set against the backdrop of a rapidly
increasing world population, global GDP growth, relatively strong
economies and heightened job creation, real estate markets are thriving.
Fundamentals continue to show great strength amidst restrained building
activity, strong demand and accordant rising rents. Despite political
headwinds such as trade disputes, Brexit, currency fluctuations and
interest-rate hikes, quality real estate continues to be occupied and in
demand.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 15, 2019-- 

Wibbitz, the leading online video creation company, today released the
findings of its new research How to Reach Audiences with Social Video:
From Millennials to Generation Z, revealing the difference in
preferences, habits, and consumption of video on social media between
the two most influential generations. Wibbitz surveyed more than 1,000
people between the ages of 18-22 (Generation Z) and 23-37 (Millennials),
reporting that Generation Z is watching 3.4 hours of video each day
while Millennials watch 2.5 hours. Both groups are spending more time
watching video than reading articles, but Generation Z is spending a
significant 70 percent more time on video. As Generation Z matures and
gains purchasing power, media companies, brands, and agencies must
understand how to reach the next generation of consumers through their
preferred medium--video.

If you Google the word *Millennial* you will unsurprisingly discover
around 133 million search results. Millennials - an indulgently
demanding generation - would refuse to settle for anything less, even
seldom settling down early in life, unlike their previous generations.
They have truly arrived with their rising ambitions at the cost of
failing business models, making them a spirited force to be reckoned
with! Millennials overtook Baby Boomers in 2016 as America's largest
living generation. As is evident from the graph, the *millennial*
generation is on a growth trajectory while the other older generations
like Baby Boomers would drastically shrink in numbers in the years to come.

Globally, Ernst & Young (EY) further corroborated that Millennials would
constitute 75% of the workforce by 2025. The writing is on the wall:
Millennials are going to rule the world by 2025!

It was the short story that captured the mood of #MeToo and became a

it live up to the hype, asks Katie Law

If youlive or work in any of the hipper parts of south London, prepare
to be assaulted next month by the sight of bright shiny foil-covered
billboards declaring “You Know You Want This” in huge letters. They’re
just a small part of one of the biggest publicity campaigns ever mounted
for a book of short stories — Kristen Roupenian’s debut collection of
the same name.

Last week, a Buzzfeed article called "How Millennials Became the Burnout
Generation" by Anne Helen Petersen explained why millennials do the
things we do. Or, don't do.

Petersen writes that millennials - those of us born between 1980 and the
mid-to-late-90s-to-2000ish, (nobody really agrees) - have spent our
young, dumb lives being "optimized" for success in school, work and
life, and when it turned out that the world was against us - no,
seriously: the economy, the job market, student debt, the general
perception that millennials are "spoiled, entitled, lazy and failures at
what's come to be known as 'adulting'" - we found ourselves without the
time, energy or resources to accomplish the kind of objectively simple
tasks and errands that everyone, of every previous generation, just did.

The BBC is trying to put together an alliance of European broadcasters
to stand up to the American internet giants. It is in talks with ITV and
Channel 4 to create a rival British streaming service. The Labour Party
is arguing for a digital tax to help fund public sector broadcasters,
and the EU - inevitably - is planning quotas to protect its domestic
industry. Over the last year, the rise of Netflix and Amazon Prime has

DETROIT – Nissan says it has seen the future and it is, of all things, a
sedan.

As the U.S. market continues to go bonkers for trucks – pickups, SUVs
and crossovers accounted for nearly 70% of light-vehicle sales last year
– Nissan says its forecast shows future buyers want four doors, albeit
with a higher ride height, and previews its interpretation of it with
the IMs EV elevated sports sedan concept car.

The Korean *millennial* generation minds whether they like the line of
work or not more than what it pays and less of it being permanent.

According to a survey released by local job portal provider Jobkorea on
Tuesday, 36.7 percent of 1,002 jobseekers aged from 19 to 37 responded
they were willing to accept a job offer even if the position was not
permanent and another 3.9 percent said they preferred to work as a
contract worker or freelancer. The other 59.4 percent replied they were
looking for a permanent job.

it’s essential.

Amazon boss is world's richest man ... now he's going to make ex-wife
world's richest woman, writes Sarah Caden

It all started out so gorgeously Gwyneth. Last Wednesday, in a Twitter
announcement of their separation, MacKenzie and Jeff Bezos's period of
"loving exploration" looked set to rival the aforementioned's "conscious
uncoupling" from Chris Martin. Keeping it cheesily cosy, the Bezos'
statement went on to say they would "continue (their) shared lives as
friends".

Risks are less than opportunities for FMCG companies. So thinks Milind
Sarwate, Founder and CEO of Increate Value Advisors. He spoke to
ETNow.Edited excerpts:Is there a reason to get worried about rural
demand because if tractor and car sales are slowing down, the rural
economy is losing pace and everyone is feeling the heat of an agrarian
distress in the economy. Could that start hurting FMCG sales?It would
start hurting FMCG sales although there may be still some time for that.
First, uptrading opportunities in premium products or brands will get
affected. FMCGs are pretty strong in terms of maintaining a long-term
growth rate. I do not think there will be a precipitous fall, but there
would be pressure on rural growth and you can easily see
that.Year-on-year growth numbers of most companies in terms of sales
volumes would be good. In terms of quarter-on-quarter growth, the
numbers are likely to be flat or small single digit growth.

BENGALURU: Banks are trying to make your dreams come true. Many have
over the past year created new kinds of accounts that help you see the
floating islands of Lake Titicaca, or have a destination wedding at
Jagmandir Island Palace, or get your LKG toddler into a good school.
It's a strategy that insurance companies and mutual funds have employed
before.For 36-year-old Mumbaikar Aisha Khan, the Rs 2-lakh trip to Saudi
Arabia to visit Mecca and Medina was through her ICICI Bank's iWish
account. A part-savings and part-loan product, the iWish account lets
you set goals for anything you desire.

NEW DELHI: Samsung plans to launch three handsets which will be
available exclusively online, at prices starting from less than Rs
10,000 to Rs 20,000, as part of a renewed ecommerce push on the part of
the South Korean firm to reclaim the top spot from the dominant Chinese
rival Xiaomi.The company’s new M-series of smartphones will be targeted
at ‘millennials’, who are flocking to ecommerce platforms to buy
smartphones, a customer segment that played a major role in helping
Xiaomi outpace Samsung. Millennials comprise people who reached
adulthood in the early 21st century.“The new series is designed around
India’s *millennial* consumers. We expect to double our online business.
That’s a significant jump in our online part,” said Asim Warsi, senior
vice-president, Samsung India.67519336He said that Samsung will continue

initiatives by the government, the confidence of the homebuyers has

the other hand, have also witnessed a smooth regulatory business

A former IBM sales director has sued the Armonk-based technology giant
for age discrimination, claiming she was fired as part of a pattern of
replacing older employees with millennials.

Terry Keebaugh, 57 of Alpharetta, Georgia, was fired in 2016, according
to the complaint filed Dec. 21 in federal court in White Plains, one
month before she was due to collect $573,000 in commissions. She got
$20,000 instead.

Fareed Zakarla is on vaction this week. George Will is filling in.

If Republicans have a lick of sense, they are alarmed by a recent sign
of intelligent life in the other party. The sign is the election by
Democrats in the House of Representatives of Illinois of Rep. Cheri
Bustos as chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. In
November, she won a fourth term by 24 percentage points, the largest
margin of any Democrat running in a district Donald Trump carried in
2016. Her task as chair, which is to cement the Democrats' House
majority in 2020, involves this arithmetic:

Ed Trebets was flying back from San Francisco — where a Vidal ice wine
he'd made at Madison's Debonne Vineyards had just been named best of
show at the 2014 San Francisco Chronicle Wine Competition — when he
realized he wanted to open his own winery somewhere in Northeast Ohio.

It was during that trip that Trebets, who also is director of the wine
degree program at Kent State University's Ashtabula campus and a former
high school chemistry teacher, discovered the burgeoning popularity of
urban wineries, which he thought might do well near Cleveland.
