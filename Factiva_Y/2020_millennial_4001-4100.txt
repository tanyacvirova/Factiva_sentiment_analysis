In London's Soho, queues snake around the block, getting in the way of
irritable commuters and hapless tourists.

There are pockets of Chinese visitors and a few university students
standing in the drizzle, but most are children and young teenagers,
accompanied by their parents. Everyone under 18 is dressed in dazzling
white trainers and bulky jackets with a just-bought sheen.

The beef industry is facing some incredible challenges — rising input
costs and increased debt loads, lower returns on investment, more farm
bankruptcies and families exiting the business, ongoing trade wars,
commodity markets in the tanks, increased consolidation squeezing small
producers out and less competition and less leverage to get the best
price for your calves.

I recently attended a local cattlemen’s meeting, and as I enjoyed a
roast beef dinner hosted by area agri-businesses, I wondered to myself,
“How many of these folks will still be in business in 10 years? And how
about the rural agricultural enterprises who rely on the farmers’ and
ranchers’ patronage?”

The Sumerian civilization was consolidated in the basin formed by the
Tigris and Euphrates rivers, which flow into the now called Persian
Gulf. He bequeathed to humanity writing, mathematics, medicine,
urbanism, among other decisive contributions.

In parallel, the use of weapons, the fortification, were material known
to that, plus a group of ethnicities that made the confrontation the
cause of its decline (21st century BC) After, in the umpteenth conflict,
the Amorites seized a city, Babylon, a new empire will be born.

In 2013, attendees of the Consumer Electronic Show (CES), the same
technology fair held this week in Las Vegas, experienced the debut of
the futuristic new 4K televisions, state-of-the-art technology that
despite its price and unavailability of content, eventually managed to
position itself in stores and reach a not inconsiderable number of homes
around the world.

The problem is that despite the progress of the proposal, already at the
time of its presentation, its future was threatened: Because a year
earlier, at the same technology fair, the manufacturer Sharp had
advanced what would come: the new 8K televisions and a 65-inch model a
little oversized and unthinkable for the time.

Three years ago, on a quiet, nondescript street in downtown San
Francisco, the world’s biggest farm equipment company opened an office –
not to sell tractors, but to house software engineers.

Today the folks at the John Deere Labs on 2nd street still get the
occasional confused look from curious passersby.

In 2019, it seemed that direct-to-consumer jewelry labels were just
heating up as the shoe and handbag categories were counting declines.

In October, The NPD Group said women’s fashion shoes were down 4 percent
compared with the same period a year prior. This came after an April
study by the firm noting that women’s handbag sales were down 11 percent
in the first quarter of 2019.

PLEASANTON, Calif. — The share of refinances closed by millennials
decreased in November 2019 as interest rates on 30-year loans climbed.
According to the latest Ellie Mae *Millennial* Tracker, 31% of loans
closed by millennials in November were refinances, down 3% from the
month prior. This marks the first month-over-month decrease for
refinance share since May 2019.

The refinance market slowed as the average interest rate on all 30-year
loans increased for the first time in 2019. For all loans closed by
millennials in November, the average interest rate was 3.95%, up from
3.90% in October. Key markets across the United States saw the effects
of surging interest rates as refinance share declined month-over-month
in Los Angeles (56% to 50%), Chicago (43% to 38%), Austin (32% to 26%),
Miami (28% to 22%), San Francisco (51% to 48%) and Dallas (30% to 26%).

You can likely thank (or blame) your parents for some aspects of how you
turned out. Maybe you have your mother’s eyes or your dad’s habit of
chewing with your mouth open.

India, as we know it, is transforming. It has come a long way from two
decades ago when the country's entrepreneurial ecosystem was still
nascent. Today, India is the third-largest startup ecosystem in the
world. This is just one reflection of the prismatic vibrancy India has
achieved in the past decade alone, having evolved holistically both as a
society and economy. At the centre of this development is the Indian
youth - the world's largest and equally diverse pool of highly charged,
capable, and skilled *millennial* as well as genzennial talent that can
be harnessed to yield unmatchable dividends.

However, when looked at from the perspective of the employer, the same
situation also forms the core of a major challenge for Indian
enterprises. In a highly competitive ecosystem that is rapidly
transforming not just technologically but also in terms of increasingly
progressive cultural as well as ethical values, the matter of acquiring
the top talent in the market becomes critical.

In one of the startup's early days Rentomojo's CEO Geetansh Bamania was
out doing door-to-door sales of furniture while his parents waited
patiently at his home to wish him on his birthday.

Hustle was the mantra for the online furniture and appliance rental
startup from the beginning. In another instance, a corporate B2B
customer once returned 300 bean bags due to a lack of space at his
warehouse, and the Rentomojo team had to sell all of them in a day. They
went around Powai in Mumbai and knocked on virtually every door to sell
them off to youngsters.

More than the relationship between Pope Benedict XVI and then Cardinal
Jorge Bergoglio, now known as Pope Francis, the film Los Dos Papas shows
different models of the Catholic Church and the answers it provides to
the world today, point out priests of the Locality.

The film, directed by Fernando Meirelles and available on Netflix, has

BART, a mass transit system that for years has ferried commuters to
stylish tech companies in downtown San Francisco, may finally bring its
own technology into the modern era.

Top agency brass are considering a potentially life-changing innovation
for BART trains and stations: seamless Wi-Fi. Passengers have pleaded
for a dependable network since the invention of smartphones, frustrated
by calls that drop in the Transbay Tube, and web pages that stubbornly
refuse to load.

New Delhi, Jan. 8 -- Short form video platforms like TikTok and the
stories mode on Snapchat, Instagram and Facebook have changed the way
people consume content on smartphones. Instead of the traditional
landscape mode, these platforms and modes are encouraging users to
create and view content in portrait mode.

Content in portrait mode works fine on smartphones, but when the same
content is played on TV, it fails to make the most of the screen and
disrupts the user experience with wide empty bars. "In smartphone we can
easily switch between vertical and horizontal modes. But when you play a
social media content from smartphone on a TV the experience isn't that
good," rues Jaipal Singh, associate research manager, Client Devices at IDC.

The greatest tragedy of life is the routine, that whole (and all wrong)
way of doing the same things as always as if this could bring different
results. It doesn't bring it. Ahead.I write this chronicle on Kings Day.
In Spain they are still exchanging gifts. Here no one already supports
the festive street decorations and the few Christmas trees that have not
yet gone to the box.

Oftentimes industry outlooks tend to be nothing more than an
extrapolation of whats already happening at the end of the year rolled
into next. For private aviation however, there are developments that
would suggest that 2020 will shape up much differently than 2019. Here
are some thoughts, trends and predictions for the year.

The world’s biggest tech show has, historically, had a sex problem. CES,
held annually in Las
Vegas,[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/01/08/ces-2020-10-best-new-tech-gadgets-las-vegas/]
has been criticised for years for an imbalance in male and female
speakers, sleazy exhibits and scantily dressed female performers.
[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/07/16/ces-tech-conference-bans-booth-babes-following-sexism-row/]


Curiously, it has also been reluctant to allow sexual technology, most
often that created by and for women, to exhibit at the show.

Capital of culture, coffee and creativity

Along with its position at the very bottom of the continent – only
Hobart beats it for southerly latitude and Southern Ocean chill –
Melbourne might have been purpose built to challenge accepted notions of
Australian city life. It can seem topographically bland, prone to
capricious cold and hot snaps, and, if blessed by a sandy fringed bay,
far from what you'd call a beach destination.

In light of the recent news that BP has set the target of creating five
unicorns by 2025 in an attempt to tackle the “dual challenge” of
providing more energy with fewer carbon dioxide emissions, rail and
energy recruitment specialist, Samuel Knight International, has urged
the energy giant to use this opportunity to attract more professionals
to the skill-short sector.

The oil and gas industry has historically battled with negative press
regarding climate change and also struggled to attract the number of
professionals needed due to outdated stereotypes, however as BP aims to
create new businesses which will address environmental issues, this can
be the ideal time to attract fresh new talent.

Experts share their predictions for the year and why change is the only
constant in the retail industry.

The retail ecosystem, offering buyers the comfort of having products
delivered to their doorsteps and frequent online season sales, has
turned the tables for the e-commerce sector quite significantly.
Furthermore, with the increasing affordability of smartphones and
cheaper data prices in the country, the mobile is the most obvious
channel for eCommerce companies when it comes to consumer outreach. With
mobile phones becoming 'the medium' and the availability of different
payment methods, from online to cash-on-delivery, shopping has become a
virtual experience for the *millennial* population.

As opposed to the standard New Year's resolution column, I'm going with
"What I did on my vacation?" In a nutshell, I was focused on maintaining
eye-contact with my kids instead of all of our eyeballs being transfixed
on electronics, which is, I suppose, resolution-like.

For screens, my teens now both have cellphones, then there are the video
game consoles, not to mention Netflix and the new Disney + channel. It
is so easy to be pulled toward them and entertained by them. Instead, I
focused on playing a lot of board and card games over the holidays. This
house policy also leaked over to New Year's celebrations at a friend's
condo.

We toured the city in the topline Venue Ultimate ($24,899), a model that
lacked for little in the way of creature comforts, albeit in a cabin
that uses a fair bit of hard plastic. Pricing starts at a low $17,099
for the manual-transmission Essential, and the CVT is another $1,300.
There's also the Preferred ($21,499), Trend ($22,599), and Trend Urban
Edition ($23,099) slotting below the Ultimate.

All models come with heated front seats, remote keyless entry, an
eight-inch touch-screen infotainment system with Android Auto and Apple
CarPlay, a rearview camera, and heated outside mirrors. Ponying up for
Ultimate gets you GPS navigation, BlueLink, a six-speaker sound system
with satellite radio, a heated steering wheel, a remote starter,
automatic climate control, and several extra safety features. Everything
is neatly and logically laid out on the dashboard, centre stack, and
touch screen.

Netflix's provocative hit show Sex Education is back, with female desire
top of its agenda, writes Eleanor Halls

When Sex Education first aired on Netflix in January last year, the
recurring word to describe the coming-of-age comedy drama was "surreal".
Created by then-unknown *millennial* writer Laurie Nunn, the show
starred Gillian Anderson as Jean Milburn, a free-spirited sex therapist,
alongside a bunch of first-time 20-something actors who play
15-year-olds navigating the perils of teenagedom in bucolic south Wales.

The Great Indian Wedding gets its docket for being extravagant,
over-the-top and exhaustive. But the moniker might soon be rendered
impractical for good. As young couples increasingly opt for waste-free
bungalows and minimalism over huge venues and opulence, weddings today
are getting intimate and niche. And with it, the food that we know and
queue up for at wedding counters are swiftly transforming, too.

As weddings turn into intimate affairs, couples look to design tight,
yet funky menus that reflect their personality, says Bhakti Mehta, the
owner of Bombay-based catering service The Little Food Co. "Many young
couples are looking to have their weddings at compact venues like a
bungalow with an outdoor setting. It is not restrictive of the kind of
food we do. Even if it's familiar cuisine, the idea is to make it more
authentic. People know the ingredients of every dish nowadays," she
explains.

A 20-minute shut eye to boost productivity? Flexible work policies being
the norm for young workers, deciding when they would like to sleep feels
like a huge perk, too

Sleeping on the job is no longer frowned upon in *millennial* workspaces
world over. Taking a cat nap, or power nap, is increasingly being
encouraged, after studies have shown that an energy nap boosts brain
power and productivity at work. The Japanese have even come up with a
term for strategising sleep into a busy workday: inemuri. Roughly
translated as 'being present while asleep' it's about revitalising
yourself with a post-lunch power nap to meet the rest of the day's work
commitments, and to keep at bay the general ennui that creeps in as the
day progresses. Also, taking a quick nap, say sleep experts, can help
one stay alert and increase perception power, turning that slumbering
slacker into a productivity ninja in the office.

By Kulbhushan Seth Since its invention in the early 16th century,
watches have been an intrinsic part of our daily lives. The category has
seen a transformation shift over the years with various trends that have
ruled the market, but the core offering of a watch has stood the test of
time. Fast-forward to the 20th century, watches have moved from being
merely utilitarian to offering unique features that make them a
must-have statement accessory. With rising disposable incomes of a
strong *millennial* base and the advancement of smart wearables, the
trend of watches is here to stay. The rise of casual and sports-inspired
dressing has given rise to the raving trend of athleisure. It is not
just restricted to fashion, but has spread across accessories and
primarily watches as a category. 2020 will see the athleisure trend gain
momentum and capture the sporty consumer, one who enjoys a stylish look
even in their casual attire.

According to a report in The Hindu Business Line, with more than one
million Indian tourists into Singapore for the fifth consecutive year,
India continues to be one of the key source markets for its tourism
sector. The Singapore Tourism Board is pulling out all stops to woo
India's vast majority of *millennial* travellers and adventure
seekers."2019 was generally a good year for Singapore Tourism. India
continues to be the third largest source of visitor arrivals after China
and Indonesia," said GB Srithar, Regional Director, India, Middle East
and South Asia, STB. While it received 1.44 million Indian visitors in
2018, in 2019 the country received about 1.19 million Indian visitors as

for Singapore. Lot of Indian travellers come to Singapore for cruising
and enjoy some of the leading cruise products Royal Caribbean, Genting

When Jyotsna Uttamchandani left Pune for the US to do her graduation in
Computer and Information Technology, she always knew that one day she
would come back and join the family business, Syska Group, and take it
to the next level.

But before that, she decided to gain some experience in the US itself
and, soon after graduation, received a job offer from Microsoft US where
she joined as a premier field engineer (PFE).

Litigation happens to be the most practiced area of law in Nigeria,
primarily because focus on who a practicing lawyer is has been
restricted to lawyers who go to court on frequent basis. Now, with the
influx of at least 3,000 lawyers being called to the Nigerian Bar, one
will think that the courtrooms will be overcrowded with young legal
professionals; sadly, these young lawyers do not last long in litigation
due to one reason or the other.

Personally, I encourage legal professionals to expand the frontiers of
the legal industry by engaging in other specialized areas of law. But
then, ask a lawyer on call to bar about a career path, 90 percent will
say they want to bring justice to the system through a career in
litigation. Ask the same lawyers a year into the profession, and only a

Although nothing changes drastically with the turn of a Calendar to a
New Year, certain trends do pick up momentum over others and few others
either die down or get subdued. Every industry tracks the market trends
while going into a New Year, and do assess the kind of impact those
trends will have on the business and industry in the course of time.
Travel, tourism and hospitality industry largely being discretionary
spending, a whole lot of macro and micro factors do get into the
decision of indulgence. Industry stakeholders have to have a fair
understanding of those factors so that they make the right movements at
the right time for a better business sense.

The Year 2020 would not be a cake-walk for the travel and tourism
industry. Along with the economic slowdown, the political discourse in
the country is also expected to pose challenges for the business and
industry, if the indications of the last few months are anything to be
believed.

On a recent Saturday afternoon, I stood with my 13-year-old son in a
long line stretching over the West Side Highway, cars careening below
us. He was waiting to take an entrance exam for a specialized high
school, a sacred moment, and yet I kept glancing at my phone to check
the time. I had to meet my mother to tour an apartment because my
childhood home in the East Village had burned down the week prior—a
month after my father was diagnosed with late-stage lung cancer. My
parents, who are in their 70s, were too overwhelmed to handle the
logistics of finding a sublet on their own. On that day, and just about
every day these past few months, I had to choose between caring for one
family member or another. With so many crises under way, caring for
myself hasn’t really been on the table.

When Swedish environmental advocate Greta Thunberg first stepped onto
American soil in late August after more than two weeks of travel, it
wasn’t on the carpeted floor of an airport. It was on the wooden dock of
a marina in Lower Manhattan.

Thunberg had sailed for 15 days from the U.K., pointedly choosing to
travel by water in keeping with Europe’s flight-shame movement, of which
she is a vocal proponent. And while the concept of flying less to help
combat climate change has yet to take off in the States, it’s also no
longer a distant possibility.

With the holiday season over, a picture of which retailers gained or
lost ground has begun to emerge.

And industry analysts say Target came out on top, Walmart and Lululemon
fared well, and Macy’s and Nordstrom appear to have performed better
than expected. Costco and Best Buy also fared well.

Marla Newman, newly promoted to EVP, digital sales at Meredith, has
lived one of the widest-ranging professional lives of any A-list media
exec. She started selling newspapers during college, calling on pizza
places and other local businesses in Eugene, Oregon. She then pivoted to
TV at an NBC affiliate, where she plied her craft during the glory era
of what the network humbly dubbed Must-See TV. Later, before arriving at
Meredith, she logged stints at MTV Networks, Microsoft and Fox Sports.

But it was her single excursion outside the traditional sales realm at a
Silicon Alley tech startup that let her know where her strengths,
interests and enthusiasms lied. “Every time we put the technology on a
client’s server, it blew up,” she recalls with a laugh. “I was in the
tech world calling on CTOs, which isn’t me. It was kind of my semester
abroad.”

The grotesque invasion of the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) campus
in New Delhi by a gang of hooligans hired ostensibly by political
factions can be condemned till the nation is blue in the face but not
much will happen. Whether there were 300 or 10 is moot. They were
allowed to go about their viciousness. This sordid assault clearly had
some sort of unspoken official sanction that allowed the police to stand
by indolently and let the attackers have a field day.

While the probe and the belated wringing of hands will tango tunelessly
for a few days with the low-key response from the centre to this
aberration before fading into nothingness there are other offshoots of
this black day in the Indian capital.
