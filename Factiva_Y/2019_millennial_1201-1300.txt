Dr. Priscilla Chan and husband Mark Zuckerberg have pledged 99 percent
of their fortune from Facebook Inc. to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a
limited liability company founded in 2015 that’s dedicated to
eradicating disease, improving education and reforming the criminal
justice system.

And they're putting their money where their mouths are: Bloomberg
reported in
January[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-03/mark-zuckerberg-halts-stock-sales-as-facebook-shares-tumble]
that Zuckerberg has sold more than 30 million Facebook shares, with an
estimated worth of $5.6 billion, to fund philanthropic endeavors.

Martin Margiela built a 100-million euro fashion business with few
outsiders knowing what he looks like, Rei Kawakubo is such an introvert
she skipped the receiving line at the Met Gala in her honor, and Miuccia
Prada barely peeks out from backstage at the end of her shows.

But in the age of social media and fashion as entertainment, are
designers who shun the spotlight missing out on a world of opportunity?
Is it possible anymore to simply let the product speak for itself?

Javiera Moraga is 23 years old, she studies Law and plans her meals
exhaustively. "When I go shopping, I put the menu in my head, I try to
make it as varied as possible, like vegetarian dishes two or three times
a week, always with fruit and organic vegetables, there must be a day of
animal protein, normally I do it with chicken that does not have
hormones or eggs, which must come from free chickens. " On the other
hand, his colleague Ignacio Rosales, 26, does not worry so much about
his diet: "I never plan, I have little time between university and work,
so I usually do it on the street. a week". The eating habits that
millennials follow, a group between 18 and 35 years old, are difficult
to define. It is a generation in which diversity reigns, a word that is
also served on the plate. "There are many groups of young people, it is
not very homogenous," explains Paolo Castro, president of the Chilean
Association of Nutritionists.

As "alarming" describes the Minister of Sport, Pauline Kantor, the
figures that a few weeks ago showed that 23% of Chilean school children
are obese. If overweight children are taken into account, the most
recent Nutritional Map of the National School Aid and Scholarship Board
(Junaeb) shows that 52% of students fall into this category. "If you
project them, these levels of overweight and obesity mean that many of
these children will have chronic diseases when they grow up," explains
the minister, whose portfolio is already working on a new sports plan to
reduce risk. The program - named Crecer en Movimiento - promotes work
from schools. In partnership with the Ministries of Education and
Health, which help identify schools at risk, the initiative aims to make
physical activity more present throughout the life cycle of students,
starting with pre-basic education. For this there are three pillars.

MUMBAI: Job search portal Monster.com has launched an integrated
communications campaign as the Official Supporter of #WorkLifeBalance.
The campaign will go live across India, Gulf, Singapore, Malaysia, and
the Philippines. The objective of this campaign is to raise greater
awareness around issues concerning #WorkLifeBalance in a humorous way.
The campaign is led by a series of films, conceptualised by Famous
Innovations and directed by Rajesh Krishnan (Soda Films).

Famous Innovations founder and CCO Raj Kamble commented on the campaign,
"Work-life balance is a burning issue in India's corporate culture today
and the new generation of professionals sees it as the utmost priority.
Through this campaign, we wanted to position Monster.com as a proud
supporter of Work-Life balance and therefore help the brand be seen as
one that understands what the *millennial* workforce wants. We chose to
do so in a light-hearted yet striking way."

A generation of “*millennial*” new towns needs to be built in the
commuter belt circling London to provide homes for young workers priced
off the housing ladder, a report concludes today.

It says the “pioneering spirit” of post-War planning that created new
towns such as Crawley, Bracknell and Milton Keynes needs to be rekindled
to solve the capital’s housing crisis.

When a quiet neo-Jacobean hotel adored by Winston Churchill – all creaky
floorboards and camellia bushes – announces that it is opening a £14 
million spa, that is cause for anxiety as well as excitement. Even for
those of us who enjoy a steam and sauna, the thought of guests padding
white-slippered through the tobacco-tinged billiards room in which
Churchill used to chomp on his cigars just seems wrong.

Spa extensions are a risk. Too often, ugly contemporary buildings will
mar a historic hotel’s landscapes. What was once a serene retreat can
suddenly find itself overrun with hyenic hen parties and the
his-and-hers-massage brigade (you will always spot the latter hunched
and silent at breakfast next day, catching up on their Instagram feeds).

A bank of new Peloton bikes will soon line a workout room in a Columbia
office tower — and if tenants don't want to exercise, they could always
take a sushi rolling class.

The trendy workout equipment will be the main draw in a
6,000-square-foot lobby and common space in Columbia Gateway as a
106,000-square-foot building that first opened in 1998 is being
redesigned and remade for the future.

India, March 11 -- Sara Ali Khan never fails to impress us with her
style choices and be it traditional or contemporary; the Simmba actor
always gets it right. Be it couture or affordable fashion, Sara Ali Khan
knows how to maintain the balance as the *millennial* youth icon is one
of the most followed fashionable celebrity at present. Sara has tried
everything and the elegance and attitude that comes with her blessed
genes makes her stand out among her contemporaries. Sara was recently
spotted in the capital with Karthik Aaryan on a shoot for Imtiaz Ali's
Love Aaj Kal 2. We love the chemistry but what really stood out was a

Traditionally, buying your first home is one of those milestones
associated with getting married and starting a family. But the
*millennial* generation isn't traditional; they're marrying later and
having children later than other generations. However, that's not
stopping them from becoming homeowners.

Millennials are the largest group of home buyers by generation,
representing 36 percent of them, according to the National Association
of Realtors' 2018 Home Buyers and Sellers Generational Trends Report.
While 66 percent of those *millennial* buyers are married, 15 percent
were unmarried couples, 12 percent were single women and 6 percent were
single men. Researchers at ATTOM Data Solutions, a property data
analytics company, found that nearly 18 percent of homes purchased in
the second quarter of 2018 were bought by co-buyers, which they refer to
as multiple, non-married buyers listed on the sales deed.

CHICAGO, March 11, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Fitness is a $30 billion
industry in the U.S., and as consumers invest more in their wellbeing,
media site aSweatLife dissected its readers' habits and spending with
three years of data and 1,300 responses. Overall, respondents reported
that they've decreased their average monthly fitness budget while
increasing the portion of their budget dedicated to digital fitness and
boutique classes.

aSweatLife's largely *millennial* readership shared its average monthly
fitness spend across categories (classes, training sessions, gym
membership, or fitness app subscriptions). Respondents reported an
average monthly total spend of $112.48 in 2018, down from $125.50 in
2016. See the full report here.

Everyone kept a close eye on their wallets and bags at the Mobile World
Congress after a spate of thefts at the three-day event. The executives
of one of India's three major telcos went a step further with special
concealed pouches inside jackets to hold passports and money so they
couldn't be easily stolen.

The late Lord Kumar Bhattacharya, who passed away in London earlier this
month, was a mentor to many Indian industrialists, especially in
manufacturing, persuading them to adopt best practices. Among those who
came calling toward the end was Venu Srinivasan, chairman of TVS Motor
Co, who spent about a week with him. Ratan Tata, who had sought Lord
Bhattacharya's views on the Jaguar-Land Rover acquisition and succession
planning, among other things, also visited to bid his dear friend goodbye.

NEW YORK, March 11, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- HSA administration company,
Clarity Benefit Solutions, offers tips for keeping *millennial* workers
engaged.

Millennials are categorized as those who were born between the
mid-eighties and the early 2000s, who are currently in the age range of
18-35. This is a fairly large range that approaches the workplace
differently than their older counterparts, so it is vital to keep them
engaged and interested in their jobs. Here are some tips for
accomplishing this task.

Charlie Kirk is a 25-year-old right-wing firebrand who thinks free
speech is under threat. He tells Tim Willis why he's in Britain this week

Most of our educators and legislators begin their political journeys in
their late teens. It's said that, aged 18, Jeremy Corbyn came to a
worldview that has remained unmodified. At the same age in 2012, Charlie
Kirk, a high-school contrarian from the suburbs of southwest Chicago,
had his first article published on Breitbart, a right-wing news website.
(It was about the supposed bias against supply-side economics in his set
reading.) Three months later, this well-born young man, whose father
made his money in construction, had his great insight.

Inventive podcasters are changing the way we ­consume information on audio

Sweet-smelling mist from boiling sugarcane juice seeps into dark, fudgy
pyramids of cane jaggery. When a scraping of this is spread on hot
chapatis, it makes for compulsive eating. Now consider rich, syrupy
nolen gur spilling out like lava from a quintessentially Bengali
dessert. “Gur is the vertex of health, heritage and taste,” says food
writer Vikram Doctor in the Real Food Podcast, a show curated by him on
stories of Indian food—from the everyday to the extraordinary. Doctor
takes us on a sensory trip to ancestral kitchens, exotic vegetable farms
and gourmet restaurants. We hear from modern agriculturalists, health
practitioners and heirloom aficionados about India’s gourmet secrets.
Like Doctor, other podcasters too are breaking into the new talk-radio
scene in India. These episodic series of digital audio files made
available on the internet are now being touted as “the new radio of the
*millennial* era”.

SAN FRANCISCO - Soleil Ho is here, and she doesn't want anyone to know
it. But the San Francisco Chronicle's new restaurant critic could pass
for younger than her 31 years, so when a server asks her for ID after
she orders a cocktail, she winces imperceptibly. She's not truly
anonymous - after years of posting photos on social media, never
expecting to get a job as a critic, that ship has sailed - but she
doesn't want special treatment. She's armed with fake names and new
credit cards. But getting carded is "the one thing you cannot bulls---,
because it is illegal," she said.

The server studies it and mouths the words "Ho, Soleil," and her date of
birth, but there's no recognition in her eyes.

Features | Sarah Young celebrates the no-brainer shade that goes with
absolutely everything – and is no longer seen as bland

From *millennial* pink to gen-Z yellow, some of the most prominent
colour trends to have emerged from fashion in recent years all have one
thing in common: they are bright, bold and unashamedly command the
attention of onlookers. So it may come as a surprise to learn that this
season, fashion’s must-have shade of the moment is decidedly more
understated: beige.

Some believe this is the age of millennials. But as companies across the
globe target *millennial* consumers, one retail chairman has set his
sights in the opposite direction - the over-70s. "A lot has been said
about millennials [but] I'm more interested in the perennials. I think
that's a generation that has been overlooked," said Johnny Sandelson,
chairman, Thomas Goode & Co."When we were young, people thought the
elderly were going to be dead by the age of 75. Now the focus is on
people [over 60-70 years] who feel healthy and ambitious to take up new
hobbies and new tasks."This is why Sandelson believes that the age
debate should also shift from millennials to perennials. "If you're born
now, you have a 30 per cent chance of living to a 100. So, the age
debate is really about the elderly not the youth.".

Chichén Itzá, Yucatan,
Mexico[https://sputniknews.com/images/107311/18/1073111866.jpg]

An underground treasure trove of ancient Mayan artefacts - the “cave of
the jaguar god,” - was first discovered by local farmers in 1966 under
the ancient city of Chichén Itzá, Mexico, Vice's Motherboard reported.
For unknown reasons the cave was walled off and only now archaeologists
have gained access to it, revealing hundreds of items dating back more
than 1,000 years, such as decorative plates, grinding stones, incense
holders, and figures of Balamkú, the jaguar god.

Team Trump, which is often caught by surprise -- but seldom pleasantly
-- seemed to catch a few unexpected breaks this week.

Paul Manafort, the President's former campaign chairman on his way to
prison, entered his sentencing hearing Thursday, abjectly and in a
wheelchair. He wheeled out with ... a 47-month sentence, way below what
federal guidelines called for and far less than many dumbfounded Trump
critics, and others, said he deserved. Judge T.S. Ellis' sentence "sent
terrible messages to the public about our criminal justice
system[https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/07/opinions/manafort-sentencing-opinion-honig/index.html],"
lamented Elie Honig, a former federal prosecutor.

Two of my children were born in socialist France. They survived. In
fact, their births were great experiences: excellent medical care,
wonderful postnatal follow-up, near-zero cost. My son’s bris, in a Paris
deserted through the August exodus, was another story, but I won’t get
into that.

France has one of the world’s most elaborate social protection systems.
The ratio of tax revenue to gross domestic product, at 46.2 percent, is
the highest of
all[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oecd-tax/government-tax-takes-at-record-high-with-france-in-top-spot-oecd-idUSKBN1O411Y]
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. In the
United States, that ratio is 27.1 percent. Look no further to grasp
Franco-American differences.

Beer isn’t just a drink for blokes, with more and more women opting to
down the amber ale over a glass of chardonnay.

The folk at Great Northern Brewing Co conducted their own internal
survey to find out if in fact *Millennial* women were drinking more beer
than older generations.

TikTok will change the way your social media works — even if you’re
avoiding it.

Hello, person who is, statistically speaking, a human adult aged
approximately “*millennial*” to “boomer.” The analytics suggest a high
likelihood that you’re aware there is an app named TikTok, and a
similarly high likelihood that you’re not totally sure what it’s all
about. Maybe you asked someone younger in your life, and they tried to
explain and possibly failed. Or maybe you’ve heard that this new,
extraordinarily popular video
app[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/03/technology/tiktok-a-chinese-video-app-brings-fun-back-to-social-media.html]
is “a refreshing outlier in the social media universe” that’s “genuinely
fun to use.” Maybe you even tried it, but bounced straight out, confused
and sapped.

AUSTIN, Texas - To polite applause, Howard Schultz pushed his case for
independent centrism. Nearby, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., made an
impassioned case for breaking up the country's biggest technology
companies. A few blocks away, former congressman Beto O'Rourke was
mobbed after sitting through the premiere of a documentary about his
unsuccessful 2018 Senate campaign.

In short: The 2020 circus had arrived at the hipster-techie festival
that is South by Southwest.

I should start by saying that the Magnetize Maine 2019 Summit is doing
important work. They are attempting to "stimulate the conversation" and
"transform Maine's future work environment and inspire younger workers
to remain in our great state."

This is a necessary undertaking; Maine's workforce is rapidly aging
(statistically - our individual Mainers are, of course, aging slowly and
in a stately manner, like a beautiful oak tree). Maine's deaths are
outnumbering births; I've never been good at math, but even I know those
numbers should be reversed.

The open art show ranges in quality but includes some gems.

Engine's annual "Rumpus" is an open art show. That means whatever shows
up is in. I love this kind of thing in places with a real art heartbeat.
Engine, located in downtown Biddeford, is the center of a significant
art community. So, once again, "Rumpus" is fun. Yes, it's mixed (to say
the least), but plenty of gems sparkle through, and seeing kids' art
next to professionals' can be interesting and entertaining.

Brian Chung still remembers the first time he attempted to read the Bible.

A 20-year-old college student at the University of Southern California
at the time, he'd recently converted to Christianity and was eager to
plunge into the scripture that he'd heard so much about.

Barbie turned 60 on Saturday. TheMattel fashion icon isn't nearing
retirement, however: She's being strategically reinvented to reflect
today's increasingly diverse world.

Thin, blond, white Barbie is on her way out. Physically and racially
diverse Barbie dolls are in. And, accompanied by messaging that promotes
progressive values, the diverse dolls are poised to become central to
the brand's image.

Israeli hostels are flourishing. More and more hostels are opening in
every city, offering a quite different accommodation experience than is
usually associated with hostels as a default option for low-budget
tourists. Israeli developers are expanding or opening new places, and
not just in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. The large "affordable hotel" chains,
including Selina, Meininger, and A&O, are already on the way to opening
Israeli branches.

Michael Jackson makes us uncomfortable now, so his music should, too

The song — catchy, peppy, and familiar — is the ideal soundtrack for a
credit card commercial targeting young professionals. We see them
bowling and buzzing on go-karts, smiling in a whirl of *millennial*
exuberance and gleeful consumerism.

Support-dog scam

It's bad enough when people are inconsiderate and let their little kids
run around and scream in a restaurant, but now it is getting worse, as
restaurant patrons have to put up with "service animals" and
"emotional-support animals" ("Who Let the Dogs Eat?" March 6).

Myntra announces the launch of a wide-ranging content campaign titled
'Straight Outta Street', aimed at enhancing its position as the
powerhouse and the ultimate destination for contemporary fashion. The
multi-faceted campaign on street fashion in India has just begun with
the launch of a film, which is also the fifth in the Myntra
Unforgettables series that highlights and celebrates people's passion
for fashion.

The campaign is focussed on contemporary streetwear, a popular new
phenomenon and a mindset of many a *millennial*, espoused even by
Bollywood, with the likes of Gully Boy. Hip-hop dancing, rap and street
fashion have come together to create a new identity for teenagers and
young adults across cities and towns and Myntra has captured this new
spirit through an inspiring video, shot in the heart of Mumbai.

FOR Ateneo de Manila University management graduate Vikha Louise Vargas,
learning is a lifetime thing.

When she opened Loukha Clothing, Vargas made the bold step as she didn't
have any background on designing a clothing line. But there was no
turning back for the 2015 graduate: Vargas bucked the odds to push her
clothing brand for women belonging to the members of the *millennial*
and Gen Z generations.

NO doubt, vinyl is back as a preferred medium for music fans all over
the world.

Now it begs the question: How does Original Pilipino Music-from the
albums recorded back in the 'Golden Age' of the 1960s to 1980s, all the
way up to today-fare in the market?

The people who build our homes increasingly can no longer afford them.
Even as the state elite and their academic cheering crew celebrate our
progressive boom, even the most skilled, unionized construction workers,
notes an upcoming study, cannot afford to live anywhere close to the
state’s major job centers.

In fact, notes the study, soon to be published by Chapman University,
not a single unionized construction worker can afford a median-priced
house in any of the major coastal counties, including Orange, Los
Angeles, San Mateo, San Francisco, Santa Clara, San Diego, Alameda,
Sonoma and Napa. Even with incomes averaging over $73,000 annually,
notes author and economist Dr. John Husing, most can afford
median-priced homes only in the further reaches of the Central Valley or
the Inland Empire, requiring huge commutes.

Dar es Saalam, March 10 -- As the world celebrated the International
Women's Day on Friday, companies in Tanzania have been urged to create a
sustainable culture that supports achieving a more gender balanced
society both at family level and in workplaces.

The observations were made during a panel discussion held at NMB Bank
Plc headquarters on Friday, coinciding with the annual World Women's day
commemorations.

New Delhi, March 10 -- Despite solid gains in middle and senior
management positions, women hold less than 5% of Fortune 500 CEO seats.
According to studies like The Sponsor Effect: Breaking Through the Last
Glass Ceiling, published by Harvard Business Review in 2011 and the 2018
TED talk by Morgan Stanley's managing director, Carla Harris, it isn't a
conspiracy but a surprising lack of advocacy from both men and women in
positions of influence that has lead to this situation. What makes it
complicated is that women have more mentors assigned to them than men
yet women are less likely to advance to leadership positions. The reason
for this is that while having mentors help but mentorship is not enough
to break the barriers. More than mentors, women and under-represented
communities at workplaces need sponsorship to march ahead.

Becoming a billionaire is the kind of dream most of us have — but will
probably never experience.

But for the youngest member of the Kardashian-Jenner clan it’s very much
a reality, as Kylie Jenner was crowned the youngest self-made
billionaire ever by

WOMEN have changed a lot over the generations; they’ve changed what they
wear and where they work. But new research shows they have also changed
what they drink.

The research, conducted by Cairns-based brewing company The Great
Northern, showed 69 per cent of *Millennial* women had drunk beer in the
previous four weeks, making them twice as likely to enjoy the beverage
than their Baby Boomer counterparts.

Doctor Honey:

I am a youngster of 22 years and the truth is that I have enough drag
with women. They tell me the Bad Bunny of Maipú. I do not give much ball
to the nickname. On the contrary, I am a formal boy and worried about my
studies and the snag that finances the education of my brain. For the
same reason, I am a kilometer away and at this point in my life, the
situation worries me, because I recently met a girl who offered me the
complete and uncompromising promo. Only carnal encounters to be healthy
as the stevia. But I'm afraid, Doc. My lack of experience makes me
shiver. I do not know if I can fulfill my duty.

computerized systems predicted to bring down computers and computer
networks around the world in 2000, sputniknews.com reported.

Until the 1990s, many computer programs abbreviated four-digit years as
just two digits, recognizing ‘98' as ‘1998.' Many experts believed that
on January 1, 2000, many computers would fail to operate correctly due
to being unable to recognize ‘00' as ‘2000’.

The biggest issue facing my peers is climate change. Ecological
devastation may not be the most immediate threat for most of us, most
days — though it is for many displaced by hurricanes and wildfires, or
poisoned by pollution in our communities. But it is the issue that tells
us, unequivocally, that we’re nearing the end of the path we’re on.

Nearly two-fifths of Millennials report they are considering not having
children because of climate change. On our current path, our children
and grandchildren will inherit a Philadelphia that by 2080 is as hot as
Memphis, ravaged by devastating storms like Katrina and Sandy.
Philadelphia’s working class, and the quarter of our city that lives in
poverty, will suffer first and most as prices and temperatures rise.

For Congress, the allegations of anti-Semitism directed toward Rep.
Ilhan Omar have no precedent. Yet on college campuses, in state
legislatures and in many other venues nationwide, the polarized debate
about Israel is a familiar conflict and likely to intensify in the
months and years ahead. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter Fueled
by a wave of youthful activists, including many Jews aligning with
Muslims, criticism of Israel’s policies toward the Palestinians has
grown in volume and scope, with persistent calls for boycotts and
disinvestment. Pro-Israel organizations and politicians have countered
with tough responses, and efforts to reconcile the differences have
gained little traction. Among those fearing escalation is Deborah
Lipstadt, a history professor at Emory University and author of a new
book, Antisemitism: Here and Now,” about the recent resurgence of
anti-Semitism in the United States and Europe.

DENVER, the United States, March 9 (Xinhua) -- After serving as Governor
of Colorado for eight years, John Hickenlooper aims higher. He on

We are hungry for stories, all of us, but sometimes we're too ravenous
for the same old, unhealthy meals. These narratives we tell
ourselves--about race, about sex, about gender, about money -- are too
often like fast food, in that they're over-processed, under-nourishing
and ultimately junky. We fill up on them, convincing ourselves that they
are the only food that exists.

Gender constructions are our oldest, most damaging stories. The concept
has always been in flux, and always challenged and critiqued, but still
we somehow tell ourselves -- and then tell others -- that there's only a
few acceptable ways to be a boy or a man, to be a girl or a woman, and
that there aren't any points between those poles. We need trans,
genderqueer, and otherwise gender-fluid stories, popular narratives of
memoir, autobiography and fiction, to show us new recipes for living, or
that at least remind us that these recipes have long existed and have
even tested out.

Like everyone, I came to March, and already back in Santiago, when I
walked I found several scattered scooters obstructing the passage of
pedestrians, bicycles and scooters themselves. Walking through the city
is no longer a risk-free activity. The likelihood of run over the road
is not negligible. Names such as Scoot, Limes and Mobike account for
entrepreneurs that have begun using and abusing sidewalks to develop
their activity.

Ocean City tourists will have another method this summer to remember
their beach trips in addition to key-chain telescope photos and
waterfront family portraits.

Selfie Fantasy, an interactive venue where visitors can pose for selfies
with props amid whimsical scenery, is expected to open near the
boardwalk in time to welcome summer tourists.

More young people are lacing up their walking boots. We meet a city
slicker who caught the hiking bug

There is nothing quite like stepping into the forest on a bright sunny
day, with your phone switched off and just the birds for company. Forget
mindfulness training, you can reset your mental health just by going for
a hike. While many of us know the restorative power of a good walk,
younger generations are just catching up. A recent YouGov poll revealed
that there has been a spike among 18 to 36-year-olds who are walking for
leisure – up to 50 per cent more than in previous years. “It’s easy and
free and it’s utterly addictive,” Phoebe Smith, president of the Long
Distance Walkers Association (and, at 35, part of the *millennial* gang)
agrees.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Big wealth doesn't come in monthly paychecks. It comes
when a start-up goes public, transforming hypothetical money into
extremely real money. This year -- with Uber, Lyft, Slack, Postmates,
Pinterest and Airbnb all hoping to enter the public markets -- there's
going to be a lot of it in the Bay Area.

Estimates of Uber's value on the market have been as high as $120
billion. Airbnb was most recently valued at $31 billion, with Lyft and
Pinterest around $15 billion and $12 billion. It's anyone's guess what
prices these companies actually will command once they go public, but
even conservative estimates predict hundreds of billions of dollars will
flood into town in the next year, creating thousands of new
millionaires. It's hard to imagine more money in San Francisco, but the
city's residents now need to start trying.

At some point during the winter break last month, someone covered the
playground of a public school in the Rego Park section of Queens with
swastikas and other anti-Semitic sentiments. Either poor spellers or
unfamiliar with the exact phrasing of the Nazi salute, whoever was
responsible inscribed the words ''Hail Hiter'' on the ground in chalk.

There is a place in New Jersey with rolling farmland and waterfalls,
where foxes trot and black bears lumber. Where stone buildings date to
the Revolutionary War and locals cry out in anguish at the arrival of
Dunkin' Donuts.

That place is Long Valley. A census-designated area with about 2,000
people in the municipality of Washington Township in Morris County, Long
Valley feels like it belongs in something called the Garden State.

Love seats are having a moment, and it's not down to romances. No, it's
all about lack of space, writes Kirstie McDermott MULTIPLE studies have
trumpeted the fact that the *millennial* generation is having less sex
than its predecessors. A 2018 BBC study discovered that 45pc of adults
said stress was a huge factor and in 2015, a study by Dr Jean Twenge
unpicked the fact that millennials have less sex, with fewer sexual
partners, than their parents did at the same age.

IT is common, on significant birthdays, to receive presents. But
renowned maverick Taylor Swift has chosen instead to gift us, the world,
with a piece for ELLE about the 30 things she's learned before turning
30. She appeared on the magazine cover in a voluminous yellow ruffled
dress: the international symbol for 'woman who you should now take very
seriously indeed because she is done with your s**t' since Beyonce
iconically smashed in cars with a baseball bat wearing one in her
Lemonade video of 2016.

Taylor's piece which is really a poem, an elegy, a call to arms, a
manifesto opens with the line, 'According to my birth certificate, I
turn 30 this year. It's weird because part of me still feels 18 and part
of me feels 283, but the actual age I currently am is 29'.

Enough shit talk Ciara O'Connor "God. I wish I was her," I thought with
familiar, hot envy, as I gazed at a glowing blonde Instagram-cook
holding a jar of home-made lacto-fermented cauliflower. The gorgeous
young thing gushed in the caption about her healthy gut journey how her
mental health is better, her skin brighter, her sleep deeper; but
everyone knew what she was really saying. Hers was the smug bliss of a
woman who hasn't seen below three or above five on the Bristol Stool
Chart in years. I hated her. I wanted to be her.

Wellness is basically a four-letter word now, and the coolest, most
socialmedia-friendly diets are no longer about 'strength' or 'leanness'
or whatever euphemism they use for thin; it's all about gut health.
Which means one thing. There's no way around it: the women of my
generation are obsessed with poo.

AUSTIN - To polite applause, Howard Schultz pushed his case for
independent centrism. Nearby, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) made an
impassioned case for breaking up the country's biggest technology
companies. A few blocks away, former congressman Beto O'Rourke was
mobbed after sitting through the premiere of a documentary about his
unsuccessful 2018 Senate campaign.

In short: The 2020 circus had arrived at the hipster-techie festival
that is South by Southwest.

On a recent weekday evening, 30 or so mostly white, 20-something women
still dressed in their business-casual best sat in a circle on the
second floor of a shop in Georgetown talking about death. Or more
specifically: "Would you want to know the date of your death?"

Answers were split. "The idea that we don't have control over what
happens to us is illogical to me," one says. "It makes people feel
blameless."

The lights must be low, the music deafening, the bass thumping - this is
not your grandmother's Republican mixer. No, really: Candace Owens knows
that the grandmothers of the people coming most likely vote Democratic.
Their parents probably do, too. Hell, the people who've shown up no
doubt did as well, unthinkingly, before they opened their eyes and their
ears and their minds. All the more reason for things to pop, which is
why Owens, a 29-year-old rising right-wing star and communications
director for conservative student group Turning Point USA, is agitatedly
giving directions to the crew at the Globe Theatre in downtown Los
Angeles. This is the inaugural rally of Blexit, her three-month-old
campaign to encourage African Americans (and Latinos, and other
minorities) to leave the Democratic Party - that is, mount a massive
"black exit" from the left.

They weren't exactly the most promising circumstances for a date.
Wednesday lunchtime at Poke Papa, a bustling Hawaiian restaurant in
Washington's legal district.We queued awkwardly together, making small
talk about rental prices and Amtrak trains.

They played it safe and went for the "Lomi Homie" salmon bowl, I
branched out and opted for the "K-Pop Bop", with ahi tuna and black
"forbidden" rice. Eventually we snaffled the last free table in the
room, thankfully sparing us from any more maladroit hovering.

If you are an entrepreneur in a technology business, you probably don't
wear a suit and tie to the office. If you run a company trying to get
the best out of millennials, insisting that they truss themselves up in
formal dress to come to work is probably not going to maximise your
recruitment appeal.

What is Bombay Tales about?

It is a love story set in the *millennial* background of the beautiful
city of Bombay that talks about conflicting emotions and the food and
beverage industry. The story is about the relationship between a
restaurateur and a food blogger. It is a work of fiction but definitely
has been inspired by a lot of my personal experience quirks.
