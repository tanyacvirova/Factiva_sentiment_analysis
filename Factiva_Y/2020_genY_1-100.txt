There appears to be a pandemic generosity effect. In the last
edition[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/personal-finance/household-finances/article-what-can-financially-secure-people-do-to-help-out-right-now/]
of this newsletter, I asked people who are financially secure in these
uncertain times what ideas they had to help others who are struggling. A
days-long cascade of helpful emails followed. Those with means are ready
to help those in need, if they haven’t already done so.

These ideas are presented as a kind of brainstorm. If you’re in a
position to help out, see if one or two points resonate with you. (Note:
There was some overlap in the ideas. The most commonly suggested points
are up top.)

KEEP YOUR DISTANCE AUTHORITIES are cracking down on young people who
continue to break social distancing rules and put everyone in the
community at risk.

From midnight, anyone gathering with more than one other person in NSW —
or leaving the house for anything but a “reasonable excuse” — could be
slapped with fines of up to $11,000 or six months jail time.

Gen Z are born to be digital; Gen Zers are digital natives, born between
1996 and 2010, they are studying in our higher Ed institutions now.
These students grew up not only with computers and internet access, but
also with smart phones, social media and mobile devices. It‟s time to
rethink and restructure the education system for these digital natives.
Gen X and *Gen Y* teachers, who have been using chalk & talk approach,
need to reshape curriculum and content delivery differently. Being
distracted learners, current students concentration span is low. We need
to make their learning experience rich and engaging, to empower them.

The outbreak of novel coronavirus has created an unprecedented situation
around the world, never seen in our lifetime. The shutdown is very
painful; staying at home and staying safe is the top priority. Amidst
this uncertainty and disruption Covid has brought in, there are
opportunities to initiate some positive changes in the field of education.

The COVID-19 outbreak is a personal finance debacle for people who have
lost their jobs or had their incomes cut. A recently retired reader
asked what people like himself can do to help.

Many retirees are understandably nervous right now about how the stock
market crash has affected their retirement savings. But some retirees
are fortunate enough to have pensions, annuities and reliable dividend
income. What can they and others who have the means do to help people in
financial trouble?

The media and entertainment business was thriving as we entered the new
decade in 2020 B.C. (“Before Coronavirus”).

All segments — movies, television, mobile video, music, games, esports,
immersive (VR and AR), live and experiential entertainment — expanded
over the past decade. Massively. To be sure, new platforms like
streaming and mobile cannibalized some of the earlier ones (like cable
TV) to fuel that expansion. But overall, creators and consumers benefited.

Mumbai, March 25 Variety Even as corporates are taking steps to tackle
issues like gender bias and even homophobia, ‘ageism’ or bias against a
person for their age, is becoming the new rogue at Indian workplaces,
according to a survey.

About 33 per cent of Indian employees face or have faced age-based bias
at their workplace, followed by 17 per cent who faced bias because of
their physical appearance and 15 per cent of others have faced bias on
the basis of their culture or religion, a survey by JobBuzz noted.

The proportion of young Europeans making handset purchases themselves
has grown steadily in recent years, according to a wide-ranging study of
smartphone consumption among Gen Z (born 1997-2012) and *Gen Y* (born
1981-1996) users from Kantar. In 2019, some 68 percent of smartphones
owned by Gen Z users in EU5 countries (UK, France, Germany, Spain and
Italy) were self-purchased compared to 62 percent in 2017, said Kantar,
adding that self-purchase has also increased among *Gen Y*.

To the petrol retailers who have increased the price of petrol from
around the $1.10 a litre mark to the $1.55 a litre. Under the present
circumstances, in our country, you can onlybe classed as bastards

(GCB 19/3) A leading GP has called for council to install soap
dispensers in all public toilets, oh come on pull the other leg, I have
witnessed people walking out of public toilets carrying toilet rolls
which is blatant theft, and these same scumbags will simply unscrew the
soap dispenses off the walls and steal them as well. This scumbag
behaviour would not have happened in our Baby Boomer days – we were far
more civilised than the introduction of the infamous *Gen Y* as
mentioned by KenW recently, and followed by this current GenZ who are
all sooky little greenies. Linda, retired Baby Boomer teacher.

Actress Ananya Pandey feels that star kids have an advantage as they
have easier access to people from the industry, and that she considers
"Dhadak" star Janhvi Kapoor her biggest competition.

Talking about the debate around nepotism, Ananya said: "I still agree
that we have an advantage and we get to meet people. We have easier
access to people from the industry as we have grown up around them. But
now that I've got that chance, it's unfair for me to waste it. I want to
make my father proud."

YOUNG workers are shaping up to be an employer’s dream as new research
finds they are more likely to update their skills and less likely to ask
for a pay rise.

Human resources firm Adecco’s 2020 Salary Guide finds just 22 per cent
of under-30s asked for a pay rise last year compared to a 26 per cent
workforce average.

Director, Client Solutions Group, Dell Technologies has talked
about workforce transformation and the role of technology as an enabler
in today’s workforce scenario.  Please tell us about the
multi-generational workforce and how workforce transformation can enable
and empower them The workforce of today is an interesting mix of four
different generations working together across different roles and
responsibilities. While millennials mostly enter the workforce with high
tech literacy and knowledge of the evolving technology landscape, Gen X
and baby boomers have great knowledge of the soft skills needed to
succeed in a corporate environment. They act as mentors to *Gen Y* as
they learn the nuances of innovative technologies such as VR, AR, MR, etc.

Financial planner David Field wants to help people who are approaching
retirement or already retired and worried about their finances. And why
wouldn’t they worry? Stock markets have plunged in recent weeks, and
interest rates are falling. On top of that, there’s an expectation of a
recession to come.

Mr. Field, a certified financial planner (CFP) with Papyrus Planning,
has come up with a list of six ways to reduce your financial anxiety
about retirement:

India, March 19 -- Actor Ananya Panday has blamed filmmaker Punit
Malhotra, who directed her debut film Student Of The Year 2, for her
single status. The two came together on Komal Nahta's chat show Starry
Nights *Gen Y*, where she revealed that she is currently not in a
relationship because of his protective nature towards her.

"The fact that I am single is because of Punit Malhotra. Because he
doesn't let anyone hit on me," Ananya is heard complaining in a promo
shared online by Zee Cafe. In the clip, she also tries a pick-up line on
Punit. "Do you believe in love at first sight or should I walk by
again?" she flirtatiously asks him.

to help.

Not much of a name brand selection was available when I checked Monday
morning, but that’s not the biggest issue if you’re tempted to place an
order. More important is the ethics of having someone delivering stuff
to you at a time when we’re all supposed to be isolating ourselves to
halt the spread of the coronavirus.

MUMBAI: Actor Vicky Kaushal initially felt that "a lanky guy" like him
would never be able to make it big in Bollywood, adding that he
struggled hard to build his confidence.

"Life has been wonderful, I have learned so much over the period of
time. My parents always made sure I am grounded and it's their
upbringing which has helped me reach here. While we were growing up, our
parents were very clear between necessity and luxury. Luxury was
something which Sunny (Kaushal) and I had to earn ourselves," Vicky
said, adding: "I struggled to build my confidence at first because
choosing acting as a career, appearances needs to be on point. Always
thought a lanky guy will never have a chance, but here we are."

It doesn't seem possible, but 20 years of the 21st century have passed
in a heartbeat and, in a tanguera way, the "twenty years is nothing" is
not true. Because in these two decades of the new century, there have
been extraordinary events that have changed the destiny of humanity
forever; and I doubt that I'm wrong if I claim that these changes are
gigantic and have no comparison with those of another era of the known
world.

Soma Tah The one work culture that clearly differentiates Gen X people
from *Gen Y* and Z people is the latter’s clear apathy for the 9-to-5
work culture. Internet connectivity, and the cloud and mobile-based
collaboration tools have eased their problems out to a great deal, by
enabling them to get their work done without being shackled to the
confines office spaces.  Studies have also shown that working outside
the offices makes people more social, agreeable, empathetic, and
trustworthy, and which organization would not want these qualities in
their employees? Hence, organizations made a note of that and decided to
dangle the ‘flexible work’ carrot to woo the young talents.   Workforce
collaborations are an imperative requirement in the modern-day workplace
and millennial workforce.

We have to acknowledge the short-term pain felt by long-term investors
when financial markets tank.

You can’t explain away the stress of daily stock market plunges by
telling people to keep a long-term perspective. The anxiety felt in the
current market upheaval is all the more intense because it was triggered
by a virus that is spreading quickly around the world. Stress is coming
in stereo these days.

The Co-founder and Director of Infectious Advertising shares her
learnings about the biggest challenge in front of agencies today

‘Millennials’ or *Gen Y* is the generation of people born between 1981
and 1996—the 24-40 year olds in our offices. They make up approximately
75% of the office strength and hence it is impossible to ignore them. So
let’s see what makes them tick?

The Ay Pilla number from Naga Chaitanya and Sai Pallavi's
eagerly-awaited Love Story, released a few hours ago, has taken social
media by storm for all the right reasons. The song, composed by newcomer
Pawan Ch, has been rendered by Haricharan and has a melodious musical
arrangement, which is a treat for the '*Gen Y*' audience. Many feel that
the track will be an integral part of the film.

Love Story is touted to be a romantic-drama and marks Sekhar Kammula's
return to filmmaking after a hiatus. The film has a stellar supporting
cast that includes Posani Krishna Murali and Rao Ramesh.

Generation Z in Thailand are more entrepreneurial, more concerned with
financial success and more open to diverse viewpoints than their
counterparts in Western countries, says a study by Stamina Asia, a
Bangkok-based research company.

The results of the "Meet the Zers" study found Thai Generation Z share
most of the features with their contemporaries in the West: they also
want to challenge the status quo in terms of values, environment,
technology and relationship with brands.

Trip-cancellation insurance is one of those financial products that
makes some sense but seems totally skippable. And then came coronavirus,
which is causing people to cancel trips to affected areas like Italy.

Trip cancellation is a lot like travel emergency medical insurance. It
sounds great in theory, but making claims is tricky because of
exclusions and rules in the fine print. For some help on deciphering
trip-cancellation
insurance[https://www.moneywehave.com/how-trip-cancellation-insurance-works/]
, check out a recent post by budget travel blogger Barry Choi.

The days when a relative minority of people can invest and manage their
money effectively are coming to an end, rapidly brought about by new
technologies. Alongside this, the behavior of a new generation of
investors will reshape investment in ways we can’t even currently
imagine – they are the drivers of a sea change in the wealth management
industry.

From the perspective of the banks, there has long been a vast untapped
source of opportunity among consumers of certain demographics – for
example, those commonly referred to as “mass affluent”. According to
Accenture, past attempts to target the mass-affluent market have largely
failed because of high servicing costs. There is truth to this: wealth
investing has traditionally been conducted face–to-face through a
relationship manager, and the costs of managing a portfolio manually
mean that the minimum amount needed to invest can be prohibitive for some.

Despite armchair analysts’ tired observation that business that “go woke
go broke”, employees who work at those companies want them to continue
to value their contribution to climate change and mental health, among
other issues.

A new survey of 1214 employees across a variety of industries and
generations towards the end of last year revealed employees want the
businesses they work for to be as concerned about their impact on
society as they are with how much money they make.

MUMBAI: Actress Sara Ali Khan doesnt think she grew up in a family of
stars, and says she doesn't consider herself as a star.

"My parents are actors, but I don't think I have grown up in the family
of stars. Father, for instance, has always been very particular about
education and my mother is the flagbearer of humility. She so believes
putting your head down and letting your work speak for yourself," Sara said.

We are keeping in mind the younger generation of stars; their lifestyle

A recent study by Queendom.com reveals that while perfectionistic tendencies tend to decrease with age, each generation still struggles to live up to personal and social standards. 
 

MONTREAL, March 7, 2020 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- International Women's Day
is a celebration of the societal barriers that women have fought long,
and fought hard, to break down. Simone de Beauvoir dared to challenge
the patriarchy's belief of a woman's role, and rights, in society. Frida
Kahlo spurred conversation on forbidden topics through her artwork. Mary
Church Terrel wasn't just one of the first African American women to
earn a college degree, she was also a strong advocate for women's right
to vote. In spite of the progress women have made in the fight for
equality, research from Queendom reveals that many still feel they are
not enough ... they believe that in order to be loved, respected and
accepted, they need to be better, look better, do more, be more, give more.

Thirty-five years ago, Steven Spielberg dipped his toe into TV as a

While it wasn’t a ratings phenomenon and was cancelled two years later,
his anthology series Amazing Stories became a cult hit for a dedicated

2020 MAR 13 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at
Energy Weekly News -- Utility websites significantly underperform those
of other service industries such as insurance, banking and credit cards,
when it comes overall website satisfaction. According to the J.D. Power
2020 Utility Digital Experience Study,SM released, utility mobile apps
show promise as a digital self-service solution, but the majority of
utilities still do not offer a dedicated app.

Now in its third year, the study assesses how customers interact with
their utility website and mobile app as well as with the online social,
email, chat and text functions offered by the 38 largest electric,
natural gas and water utilities in the United States.

In a newsletter last
week[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/personal-finance/household-finances/article-how-a-former-bay-street-lawyer-got-herself-deep-in-debt/]
, Vancouver lawyer Monique Shebbeare shared the story of how she ended
up deep in debt. After leaving a job on Bay Street in Toronto, Ms.
Shebbeare found herself with more than $50,000 in debt plus the mortgage
on her condo. Here’s her point-by-point look at how she became entirely
debt-free over 14 years, aside from a mortgage.

I cut my expenses: This meant making difficult decisions months after I
originally should have made them (rent out my condo, move in with
roommates). Then I learned how to think ahead. I got used to doing
without much in the way of new clothes, travel and eating out,
especially at the beginning when having enough for basic monthly
cut-back expenses was not a given.

Advocates of a proposed new hotel at Cronulla say it will enhance Monro
Park, which they claim is a transient area, frequented at night by drug
dealers.

Opponents are concerned about overshadowing and the building height and
floor space ratio being well in excess of LEP limits.

NEW ORLEANS — Benefit advisers must address the five generations that
now make up the U.S. workforce by moving beyond traditional healthcare
and other benefit strategies to meet changing expectations, experts said
on Tuesday.

As the age gap in today’s workforce is getting increasingly wide,
employers need to appeal to multiple generations, ranging from Gen Z to
baby boomers. New solutions may involve having an individualized
communication strategy; asking employees about their preferred
communication style is one key way to ease multigenerational
differences, said Francisco Oller Garcia, digital operations and
marketing specialist at BeniComp Health Solutions.

the glass ceilingHow has the hospitality industry changed over the years
in terms of inclusivity of women in leadership roles?

In an industry that used to see women being restricted to roles in the
front office, spa operations and communications, the hospitality
industry supports equal opportunity for everyone. Hotels all over are
now making diversity an integral part of their hiring strategy and are
giving out specific mandates for hiring women at senior level
management.What challenges and opportunities do you face holding the
leadership role?

Religin's declining influence forces N.C. spiritual leaders to rethink
their institutions' roles.

The 18 pews at Parker's Grove United Methodist Church were warmed by
longtime member Kenneth Brantley, and before him, his parents and
grandparents. With the sun streaming through the sanctuary windows, the
seats have a brown patina burnished by generations of worshippers.
Church organizers in the 1870s raised $650 to build this white,
weatherboard house of prayer about 20 miles north of Fayetteville on an
acre provided by Cader Parker.

Working with a multi-generational workforce offers huge opportunitiesfor
companies: Ashok Leyland CEO Millennials are becoming the majority of
the workforce, and they are soon going to take leadership roles in most
businesses. Simultaneously, companies need to hire the next generation
or Gen Z, who are truly ‘digital natives’.

Working with such a multi-generational workforce is not only exciting
and challenging, but also offers huge opportunities for companies, said
Vipin Sondhi, CEO and Managing Director, Ashok Leyland Ltd.

We need to talk more about debt, and I do not mean shaming people who
have borrowed a lot and are feeling stressed about it. What we need is
more sharing of stories about how people cope with and conquer their debts.

It’s this thought that made me want to feature Monique Shebbeare’s story
in this newsletter. Ms. Shebbeare is a 49-year-old lawyer in Vancouver
who specializes in wills, estates and fertility law. More than 15 years
ago, she was a Bay Street lawyer with big debt problems. Aside from the
mortgage on her condo, she owed $53,000 in student loans, various lines
of credit and a credit card.

Many in fashion are horrified by the idea. That doesn't mean it's wrong.

Virgil Abloh, the founder of Off-White and the men's wear designer of
Louis Vuitton, is the kind of fashion figure that seems to demand

I HAVE been following developments regarding the new Mara direction, as
announced by its chairman. While there has been some robust debate, it
was dominated by the older generation. People need to understand the
essence of Mara. Clause 6 (1) of the Mara Act clearly states that it is
the duty of Mara to promote, stimulate, facilitate and undertake
economic and social development, particularly in the rural areas. We
need our elders in the Mara Council to perform their full
responsibility. They must leave this country better for my generation.
They cannot allow us to continue struggling to find jobs or to pay
student loans, grappling every day with the economic situation due to
the selfish decisions made by them. We are not lazy. We are not
uneducated. We just lack opportunity. The people leading Mara either do
not understand the Mara Act, are incompetent or have been remiss in not
looking at the problems and issues facing 50 per cent of the demographics.

MILLENNIALS’ growing obsession with indoor jungles has some camping
overnight to secure rare expensive plants at specialist sales in a trend
that is a boon to nurseries.

Avid plant collector Dylan Blonde, a 26-year-old nurse, said a single
leaf from a variegated zanzibar gem he recently won in a competition
could fetch up to $120. Mr Blonde and his partner, keen bonsai artist
Dou Ribu, live with their two French bulldogs Abu and Willow surrounded
by hundreds of plants in their New Farm unit.

We live in a generation that is transfixed by the here and the now.
Quick fixes are increasingly becoming a way of life. The era of
Generation X (Gen X), born between 1965 to 1976, created more thought
leaders due to the longevity of one person in one particular job. Gen X
was more likely to have one career path over their lifespan, due to the
value of service, and by the time they retire, they would have amassed
knowledge in a particular profession; they naturally became subject experts.

This traditional path of service has seen a great fall in numbers in
recent years. Manuel Grenacher, a serial tech entrepreneur from
Switzerland, states 'The younger generations aren't looking for the same
rewards or financial incentives from their jobs as older generations.
Rather than wages and stability being the anchors that help retain them,
they're driven by purpose and flexibility'.

Actress Disha Patani recently became the talk of the town for all the
right reasons when Malang emerged as a commercial success and clicked
with the '*Gen Y*' audience. The film, the young star's first
collaboration with actor Aditya Roy Kapur, featured her in a glamorous
new avatar that took social media by storm.

With Malang hitting the right notes, Disha will next be seen in a
'special appearance' in Baaghi 3. The actress, earlier today (Feb 26),
shared her look from the Sajid Nadiadwala-backed movie and this has
piqued curiosity. Thereafter, the MS Dhoni star posted a short clip in
which she is seen grooving to a song titled Do You Love Me? and setting
the screen on fire. View this post on

There was a time in the 1990s and 2000s, when eating a Hershey's Kisses
chocolate would turn heads. For starters, the chocolate brand hadn't
launched in India. Second, people considered it 'out of reach',
'expensive', and something one's relatives staying abroad would bring
with them when they visited the motherland.

During the aforementioned decades, chocolate brands such as Hershey's
Kisses, Toblerone, Ferrero Rocher, and Lindt were the toast of the
chocolate segment in India; some still are. They were expensive, not
easily available, and getting our hands on them was more of a treat that
didn't come easy. A good number of us grew up seeing these brands in awe
and internalised certain aspects of them in our psyche.

Finally, some help for big city dwellers wondering if the high cost of
living is killing their personal finances.

“If your fixed expenses (housing, transportation, bills, utilities,
etc.) are more than 55 per cent of your take-home pay, you need to
rethink where or how you live,” financial planner Shannon Lee Simmons
says in recent article on when to leave a
city[https://www.lowestrates.ca/blog/lifestyle/expensive-city-how-do-you-know-when-to-go]
because it’s too expensive to live there.

New Research Outlines How Advisory Practices Can Differentiate and
Create Personalized and Fulfilling Experiences

OAKS, Pa., Feb. 24, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- The financial planning
profession is evolving from an advisor-driven and product-based approach
toward a consumer-driven model in which clients choose how and where to
receive advice. With growth over the next decade likely to be far more
difficult to achieve than during the previous 10 years, SEI (NASDAQ:
SEIC) and the Financial Planning Association(R) (FPA(R)) today unveiled
their latest research paper and second in the Innovation Imperative
series, "Advisory Firms in 2030: Growth by Specialization."

They've managed to save $1 million or more in their workplace retirement
accounts. I've written before about this trend and will continue to do
so to encourage those of you who think you can't save - but could if you
made it a priority.

daughter in an accident for which he hasn’t been able to forgive himself
and has severe bouts of hallucinations. So, when he ‘sees’ and ‘hears’
things on Sea Bird, he probably thinks it’s a figment of his
imagination. ‘It’s not real’. You, in the audience know ‘it’ is. Snap! Snap!

The mystery deepens when Prithvi actually comes face to face with the
biggest twist in the plot, a sole chance at redemption from his inner
demons and his attempt to forgive himself and finally move on. While
tying the threads and making way for Part Two, the revealing of ‘you
know what’ is perhaps the biggest dampener. ‘It’ is just not scary.

THEY are the “Wallpaper Millennials”: *Gen Y* homeowners who still don’t
have a place to call their own.

Coined by demographer Bernard Salt, the term refers to a new generation
of home buyers forced to navigate the two great home-owning power blocs
– Gen X and Baby Boomers.

Cos Have Difficulty In Seeing Brands From Point Of View Of Customer,
Says Neumeier

The second day of Star FLOW - The Change Festival, an initiative by The
Times of India - opened with the session 'The New Brand Model - Are you
creating Brands or Consumers?' by Marty Neumeier, director of CEO
Branding at Liquid Agency, redefining branding for marketers."I changed
it from being a logo, or a message or a campaign or a product to being
something else. A brand is a person's gut feeling about the product,
service or company," said Neumeier.
