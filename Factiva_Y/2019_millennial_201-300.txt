I received a phone call from a college student yesterday. He was a
freshman studying animal science and had been assigned the task of
interviewing beef industry leaders to learn about their careers and to
gain advice and insights for their own futures in
agriculture[https://www.beefmagazine.com/management/13-tips-increase-cash-flow-during-agricultural-downturn].

I took the call while driving to a FFA fundraiser where I was speaking,
and he asked me a wide variety of questions. What would you do
differently in your college years? What advice would you give to a
college student wanting to be involved in the industry? Who do you look
up to in agriculture? What motivates you in your career? Why is it so
difficult to bridge the gap between consumers and producers?

On March 26th Boris Johnson, in conversation with former editor and
columnist Charles Moore, delivered his thoughts on Brexit in a unique
event presented by The Telegraph’s Editor, Chris Evans. Here is the
transcript of the 90-minute event.

This was supposed to be a week of national jubilation. This was the week
when church bells were meant to be rung, coins struck, stamps issued,
bonfires lit to send beacons of freedom from hilltop to hilltop. This
was meant to have been the week of Brexit. And what has happened instead?

Unless you’ve been living under a rock, or somewhere off-grid, you will
probably have heard of Alexandria
Ocasio-Cortez[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/politics/who-is-alexandria-ocasio-cortez/]
. If you haven't, here are the York Notes: she is the 29-year-old, newly
sworn-in congresswoman who is already changing the face of the
Democratic Party.

Late last year Ocasio-Cortez made history in becoming the youngest woman
to be elected to the US House of Representatives, after beating her
longshot Republican opponent Anthony Pappas and winning the 14th
congressional district of New York with 78.2 per cent of the vote - a
victory which marked the inauguration of a new wave of progressive
Democrats.[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/06/27/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-28-year-old-left-winger-whose-democratic/]

Millennials face a nasty set of obstacles on their path to financial
security. From student loans and stalled wage growth to nosebleed
housing costs and care for aging parents, it’s a tough time to be
navigating the early years of adulthood.

An anonymous youngster with the troubling “ShortenedLife” nametag knows
this all too well, so he made the very *millennial* decision to ask
Reddit’s “Personal Finance” discussion
group[https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/b57n1q/im_24_and_i_feel_like_my_financial_situation_will/]
for tips on how to run a budget that leaves him broke at the end of each
month despite his $61,000 salary.

killed canned tuna and mayonnaise, but when it comes to wine and cheese,
they are willing to put their money where their mouth is -- and that
bodes well for imports.

What to wear? What to wear? It all used to be so simple for office
workers: formal suits for men and below-the-knee skirts, tailored suits
and silk blouses for women. Now, office style is a disparate mix of
denim, designer sneakers, athleisure and that one guy who still insists
on wearing a three piece suit and pocket square just because.

Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs made headlines when it announced it
was relaxing its dress code to be more "flexible." The storied firm is
the sort of place where one would have expected the suit-and-tie combo
to live out a long, healthy life. However, the company now permits
employees to "dress in a manner that is consistent with your clients'
expectations." J.P. Morgan made a similar change to its dress code about
two years ago.

Equifax partners with Mediaplanet to educate renters and landlords on the modernization of the tenant-screening process in new national campaign, 'Renting in America'. 
 

NEW YORK, March 27, 2019 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- According to
ApartmentList's 2018 National Rent Index, over 90 percent of the largest
U.S. cities have seen rent increases over the last year, with an upward
trend in *millennial* renters. However, according to the U.S. Census
Bureau, more than one-fifth of multifamily renters were delinquent in
their payments at one point or another. These topics and more on the
business of renting is covered in the new 'Renting in America' campaign,
out today by the leading independent publishing house of content
marketing campaigns, Mediaplanet, in partnership with one of the
campaign's leading partners, Equifax.

When someone threw a burger at Travis Alabanza, the trans performer
turned it into a hit show. Next goal? Playing Juliet

Trans people are said to be “obsessed with pronouns”, Travis Alabanza
tells me. “People think it’s tied to a *millennial* culture of being
‘snowflakes’.” But the writer and performer believes it comes back to
“allowing marginalised people to exist under rules and parameters: ‘You
can exist if you don’t make it hard for us, if you’re polite, if it’s
not a nuisance.’” Yes, pronouns can be hard to get used to– Alabanza
uses “they” – but it’s about effort. “Do you want to make the effort to
make someone feel more comfortable? If you don’t, then that says
something about you, not me.”

FashionPass, an online subscription apparel retailer launched in 2016,
is suing Rent the Runway.

In a lawsuit filed in California, Los Angeles-based FashionPass alleges
Rent the Runway has been engaging in “anti-competitive and monopolistic”
practices to prevent apparel brands from doing business with it.
FashionPass was cofounded in 2016 by *millennial* Instagram influencer
Brittany Johnson and is aimed at women in their 20s and 30s. The lawsuit
comes shortly after Rent the Runway
announced[https://www.chainstoreage.com/finance-0/rent-the-runway-earns-unicorn-status-with-new-valuation/]
it had had obtained a $125 million investment, bringing the company’s
total valuation to $1 billion.

Sparkling botanical beverage brand Petal has had a busy first year as
the company doubled its product line with three new flavors, underwent a
reformulation (swapping out stevia and erythritol for organic agave),
and is now primed for national distribution in the coming months, shared
CEO and founder, Candice Crane.

Botanical ingredients such as Petal's 'heroine' ingredient, rose water,
continue to be a hot trend in CPG with global sales of botanical
extracts used in food and beverage products expected to reach just over
$6bn by 2022, according to a MarketsandMarkets report.

Bangladesh, March 27 -- Almost suddenly, socialism has come to the
forefront of political discourse, on both sides of Atlantic, from the
background to which it was relegated as being irrelevant. After the fall
of Berlin wall in 1989, or to be more precise, after the dissolution of
the biggest and the most powerful socialist state in Soviet Union in
1991. Political historians and ideologues in the capitalist west gloated
at the turn of events in those momentous years, declaring the 'end of
history', meaning the worldwide entrenchment of liberal democracy after
the retreat of socialism in its bastion in eastern Europe stretching to
Soviet Russia. As a corollary to this, the unchallenged sway of
capitalism was also heralded in the celebratory outpouring of the Right.

If it saves time and money for the consumer, keep it in your marketing
spend. In Valassis’ annual coupon report, which polled 1,000 U.S.
consumers, coupons still have “continued appeal for motivating today’s
on-the-go consumers.”

As an “intelligent media delivery” platform, which serves 63,000
advertising clients across industries, Valassis aims to activate
consumers toward purchases. The company’s consumer properties include
RetailMeNot Everyday, which offers deals on consumer-packaged goods,

More than 100 consecutive months of job
gains[https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm] have contributed
to a unique employment environment, one where, for the first time in
recent memory, organizations have found themselves struggling to attract
the workforces they need to succeed. As the talent war has intensified,
more human resources managers have turned to recruiters, but with so
many staffing agencies to choose from, how can companies know which are
best suited to their searches?

The initial premise of Channel 4’s latest reality offering Mums Make
Porn
[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/mums-make-porn-episode-1-review-intergenerational-comedy-serious/]
stung me with irritation: five ordinary, middle-aged mothers from across
the UK join forces to make a porn film they’d be happy for their adult
children to watch.

But the tongue-in-cheek framing of mums making pornography
[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/sex/7-things-learnt-porn-making-film-let-kids-watch/]
as something exceptional and worthy of a three-part series on national
TV frustrated me. Plenty of mothers already work within the adult film
industry, and their lives and careers aren’t to be scorned, held up for
titillation, or otherwise mocked.

Where to stay in the Dutch capital for style and attitude

It may rank high on the list of destinations for stag and hen dos, but
Amsterdam has so much more to offer than an inebriated weekend browsing
its (in)famous coffee shops. The last few years haveseen a wave of new
hotels arriving in the city, seriously expanding the range of
interesting options to stay within – and, most encouragingly, beyond –
the well-trodden cobbled streets of its immediate historic core. Even
existing properties have been dealt a much needed jolt and upped their game.

Unlike earlier generations, for whom owning a home was a major life
goal, accessibility to experiences and a sense of community are more
important than ownership of property for millennials.

Recently, some entrepreneur friends and I were discussing an interesting
advertising campaign that called on millennials to join the British
Army. The posters had generated a lot of buzz on social media, kicking
off countless debates on stereotypes surrounding people in their 20s and
early 30s. "Me me me millennials", "binge gamers", "phone zombies",
"snow flakes", "selfie addicts" - is that how we really see the
*millennial* generation?

Seven political parties formed a coalition in Thailand on Wednesday,
vowing to thwart a military-backed proxy in a bid to end years of junta
rule following the country's first election since a 2014 coup.

A junta-aligned party and its main rival have both claimed the right to
govern the country after Sunday's vote, prompting a political standoff.

Wine grape growers in the northern San Francisco Bay area are promoting
“augmented reality.” And they’re not talking about how you might feel
after drinking several glasses of their finest.

The Sonoma County Winegrowers (SCW) want consumers to know about the
environmentally friendly practices they use in their operations. This
year, the group’s leaders are setting up a smart phone application that
will read the “augmented reality” labels being placed on wine bottles
from the region and provide production information to consumers while
they’re at the market.

MARICOPA, Ariz. -- The exurbs, the engine of the American housing
market, are back.

A decade ago, the sight of new homes under construction in Maricopa, an
enclave of tidy cul-de-sacs 35 miles from downtown Phoenix, was almost
unimaginable. Four in five homeowners were underwater, with their
outstanding mortgages worth more than their properties, according to
housing data tracker Zillow. Neighbors felt compelled to cut the hedges
and clean up garbage at empty houses.

I was having coffee with Stephen Alesch of the New York architectural
interiors powerhouse Roman and Williams the other day and he was telling
me about his work on the forthcoming NoMad hotel in London, repurposing
the old Bow Street Magistrates’ Court in Covent
Garden[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/united-kingdom/england/london/central/west-end/covent-garden/hotels/]
. “Oh, I spent a night in there a long time ago,” I told him. He
laughed. “I thought you might have done, you look the sort,” he said,
with an arched eyebrow. “Well, it was the Nineties,” I replied.

unique offering and retail experiences are crucial in turning
*millennial* travelers into duty-free buyers in the Americas. This was
the key takeaway from Tuesday morning’s conference session at the Duty
Free and Travel Retail Summit of the Americas in Orlando, presented by
research firm m1nd-set’s owner and ceo Peter Mohn and project and
business development manager Anna Marchesini.

They addressed the behavioral differences of three generations of
consumers in the Americas in travel retail—millennials, those aged
between 35 and 55, and older consumers, revealing that millennials are
much less likely to buy than older consumers.

*Millennial* Money Woes at Heart of Declining Marriage Rates? 
 

SAN FRANCISCO, March 27, 2019 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Charlie Finance, a
text-based AI chatbot radically changing the way people think and feel
about money, today released initial findings from its 2019 Money and
Dating survey. This inaugural study, conducted by Ipsos for Charlie,
surveyed single *millennial* women (defined as being between the ages of
18-40 and never married) on how finances factor into considerations of
compatibility for long-term love. The outcome could change how financial
institutions serve this new generation and affect how wealth builds for
generations.

(PRWeb) - Hotel Chicago West Loop has announced the appointment of a
new, dynamic leader. At only 31-years-old, Virginia-native Jean-Luc
Laramie is (quite possibly) the youngest hotel general manager in
Chicago. In his role at the independent, 3-year-old dual-purpose
property known for its eccentric art initiative, Laramie oversees
operations while looking to expand the hotels relationship with
*Millennial* travelers.

This is not your typical hotel, said Laramie, whos moved his way up from
bellman to GM in less than a decade. While we may not have all the bells
and whistles, we have a colorful culture that cannot be replicated. Its
exactly the sort of thing todays contemporary traveler appreciates!

A giant Singapore government-run fund has acquired a 25% stake in Dutch
hotel company citizenM, providing a cash boost to the owner and operator
of microhotels, as it ramps up a global expansion.

The sovereign-wealth fund, GIC Pte. Ltd., confirmed the investment but

billion), the lodging company said.

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.— As 21,306 coworking spaces are projected to open
by the end of 2019, Venture X® is emerging as a top-tier player by
filling an obvious gap in the exploding shared workspace category – the
middle ground between *millennial* playgrounds and stiff suit-and-tie
work environments.

“We designed our shared workspaces to feel modern and professional, a
collaborative community where you can get your work done without the
distraction of office parties or ping pong tables, but not so stuffy you
feel the need to wear a suit and tie,” said Venture X President Jason
Anderson. “We continue to grow because we fill a unique demand for warm
and welcoming office environments that meet the needs of seasoned
professionals.”

LOS ANGELES — For as much as the industry has chatted up the habits of
the *Millennial* consumer, it seems to be just as quickly turning its
attention to the next cohort — Generation Z — with Revolve Group Inc.
the latest to focus on this growing segment with the launch of shopping
site Superdown.

It’s the latest move, signaling a shift in attention by marketers, that
a company built around knowing how to speak to Millennials via the
influencer route is now turning to the consumer group loosely defined by
birth years beginning somewhere in the mid-Nineties.

Seven political parties formed a coalition in Thailand on Wednesday,
vowing to thwart a military-backed proxy in a bid to end years of junta
rule following the country's first election since a 2014 coup.

A junta-aligned party and its main rival have both claimed the right to
govern the country after Sunday's vote, prompting a political standoff.

HOUSTON, March 27, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- These days, most
adults--especially millennials--do pretty much everything on their
phones. Whether it's reserving a flight, ordering groceries for the
week, or finally scheduling that overdue doctor appointment... an easy
online booking experience is quickly becoming a must. And now,
Texas-based 3 Men Movers is adding one more thing you can do from your
phone: booking your move.

If you haven't moved in a while, most moving companies still operate
from 9 to 5 and require you to schedule your move over the phone. Seeing
this void in the market, the 3 Men Movers development team, a group of
highly talented millennials, put their heads together to create
something they would love to use themselves.

Though British Columbia should be fertile ground for the Liberals to
grow support ahead of October's general election, the party's biggest
asset in 2015 is now its biggest liability: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

That's according to Martyn Brown, a former BC Liberal - a provincial
party that has no ties to the federal one and is often aligned with
small "c" conservative values - who was chief of staff for the
province's premier during the 2000s.

expertise is still preferred over AI technology, says GlobalData

Technology is a relatively new addition within the wealth management
industry, from robo-advisors to AI-enabled chatbots. However, the need
for human financial advice will not be pushed to the side any time soon,
says GlobalData.

On Instagram, a new battle over conspiracies and scams is taking
place[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/03/26/facebook-instagram-could-hit-new-laws-do-not-do-enough-stamp/]
. In just a few clicks and within seconds, you can be taken from a world
of friends' holiday photos of South Pacific beaches and *millennial*
avocado-fuelled brunches into a disturbing Neverland of dangerous fantasy.

It takes just one click to guide your Instagram account down a rabbit
hole and into conspiracy theories. While Facebook and YouTube have
gained notoriety for allowing so-called “fake news” to spread, Instagram
is proving just as bad.

New Delhi, March 27 -- Six months ago, in a historic verdict, the
Supreme Court of India struck down Section 377, a British-era law which
criminalized same-sex relationships between consenting adults in India.

The law's demise was a cheerful conclusion of a protracted legal battle
for LGBTQ rights in India-but the fight for LGBTQ societal acceptance is
far from over.

LAST-MINUTE *MILLENNIAL* ENTRYIn the Basavanagudi area, 28-year-old
Tejasvi Surya is a boy next door. His Facebook page shows he is a biker.

Until the BJP announced his name as the party candidate for the
prestigious Bangalore South Lok Sabha constituency, not much was known
about the advocate for a lay person. The Basavanagudi resident is,
however, quite well-known in the BJP, RSS and ABVP circles. His Twitter
account has almost 63,000 followers. His fiery speech in praise of
Narendra Modi has gone viral on Twitter.

Do you dream of your children becoming a farmer or an artisan? Even if
the answer is a yes, one dreams big to become a businessman dealing in
carpets and hiring other artisans rather than becoming one himself.
However, times are changing and there's a big effort to rejuvenate the
art of carpet weaving in Rajasthan.

Carpets from Rajasthan are customarily notable for fine-quality and
hand-hitched woollen-fibers. Jaipur, Ajmer, and Bikaner are primary
places for this specialty. Jaipur has been a major center of the Mughal
rule for carpet weaving. It is believed, carpets were initially
fabricated in Rajasthan when weavers from Afghanistan started to settle
in the royal ateliers in the 17th century. Ever since, they have
flourished here, with their high-spirited colours and geometric motifs

Young adults in India have a hard time negotiating traditional roles,
while pursuing a certain autonomy in life choices Millennials —
individuals born between 1980-99 — are constantly scrutinised as
Generation Me. They are misrepresented, stereotyped, and unappreciated.
Millennials — often referred to as irresponsible and lazy young persons
— have recently received a lot of media attention in India, from
speculations about their spending habits to whether they are the most
depressed of all generations.

These individuals have grown up in a fast-changing globalised society
and, contrary to their parents and grandparents, have had to adapt with
the burgeoning demands of modern times in addition to the developmental
challenges in transition to adulthood.

ICICI Prudential AMC announced launched the ICICI Prudential Bharat
Consumption Scheme. The Scheme aims to benefit from the Indian
consumption story, considered as one of the fastest growing consumption
markets globally. The benchmark for the Scheme is Nifty India
Consumption Index and will be managed by Rajat Chandak and Dharmesh
Kakkad. The overseas investments of the scheme will be managed by
Priyanka Khandelwal."Globally, it has been observed that the moment a
country’s per capita GDP crosses $2,000*, there is a disproportionate
rise in discretionary spending and India is poised to cross this
milestone in 2019-20,” Nimesh Shah, MD & CEO, ICICI Prudential AMC, said
on the launch of the scheme. “With the largest *millennial* population
globally, India offers a growth potential for consumer markets and
retailers as *millennial* differ from previous generations by their
lifestyle choices, consumption pattern, significant need for convenience
and brand preferences,” he added.

Perth’s burgeoning co-working market was being driven by corporates
seeking project space they could dial up or down, CBRE’s Australian head
of research Bradley Speers has declared.

Mr Speers, answering a question about whether there was an “unlimited
supply of *millennial* tech entrepreneurs” at a CBRE market outlook
presentation last week, said most co-working demand was from big corporates.

When Kevin Rudd was prime minister he sometimes held doorstops outside

Sydney | Next month's Indonesian election could be closer than people
expect and will be decided on personalities rather than issues,
according to Dewi Fortuna Anwar, a former senior adviser in the
Vice-President's office.

Speaking at the Lowy Institute in Sydney on Tuesday, Ms Dewi said while
Indonesian President Joko Widodo - a pragmatic furniture
salesman-turned-politician with a solid record in improving
infrastructure - was ahead in the polls, his lead was narrowing.

BEVERLY THOMSON: Well, in Manitoba, the prime minister was promoting the
proposed new measures aimed at helping workers upgrade their skills and
training. But some critics say the measures put too much onus on the
employees. For more on this, David MacDonald, a senior economist with
the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, joins me in studio. Thank
you for coming in on this. So it was announced as good thing, more
money, skills training, it's all good, but is it all that?

Sharply, the Seattle-based menswear brand built on basics, opened a
temporary shop this week at the Refinery Hotel in New York City’s
Garment District. The 750-square-foot, street level space offers the
brand’s full range of “Made in USA” T-shirts, henleys and sweatshirts,
plus denim from Los Angeles-based S.M.N. Studio.

Hotels, it seems, are becoming a hotbed for apparel pop-ups. Denim and
basics brand, Cotton Citizen, set up shop at 11 Howard last year, while
Abercrombie & Fitch found a match in *millennial*-focused Sbe hotels
where it held co-branded events and pop-ups.

A half-dozen or more Milwaukee commercial real estate developers are
scrambling to submit responses by Friday to American Family Insurance’s
proposal request for its planned downtown Milwaukee office building.

While the company is believed to be most interested in locating west of
the Milwaukee River, it’s likely American Family will receive proposals
for other downtown locations or sites near the central business district.

RICHARD QUEST, HOST, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS: We are in the last hour of
trading on Wall Street before it all comes to an end. The gains -- good
gains -- of the day evaporated near the afternoon. But it is holding on
and if no damage is done, it will be positive on the close. Put it
together, together we understand the markets on Tuesday, the 26th of
March. Parliament is seizing control of Brexit. Tonight, you will hear
from lawmakers, businesses and voters on all sides of this debate.

One does not simply crack down on memes. A sweeping new copyright law
angers European internet users and companies as well. There is a crisis
of confidence in the cockpit, a new report shows just how little time
the pilots of the doomed Boeing 737 MAX had to react.

*HD* 	Will Priyanka Gill’s Content-Community-Commerce strategy garner
100 million MAUs for POPxo?

POPxo needs no introduction! The company led by Priyanka Gill was early
to spot an opportunity in India’s digital media space and, today, it has
potentially gathered a large community of women followers. An apparent
gap was identified by Gill way back in 2014 – when there were very few
women-focused magazines having an online presence. She placed POPxo
then, and today it is India’s largest digital community for *millennial*
women and has an unrivaled advantage in that space. Gill has to her
credit of setting the “Influencer Marketing” tone in India’s digital
world. The start is always humble “We started building and promoting
content that helped women become better in all aspects of their life, be
it fashion, beauty, work or relationships. We used social media to reach
out to our target audience and engaged with them,” initiates Priyanka
Gill, Founder & CEO of Luxeva Limited, the media-tech company behind
three of India’s biggest digital brands: POPxo, Plixxo, and Luxeva.

VANCOUVER—Though British Columbia should be fertile ground for the
Liberals to grow support ahead of October's general election, the
party's biggest asset in 2015 is now its biggest liability: Prime
Minister Justin Trudeau.

That's according to Martyn Brown, a former BC Liberal — a provincial
party that has no ties to the federal one and is often aligned with
small “c” conservative values — who was chief of staff for the
province's premier during the 2000s.

During the last decade, the Internet has evolved drastically in India,
paving its way not only to the urbanised Indians but penetrated into the
semi-urban and rural segments. Availability of internet and smartphones
at cheaper rates created an internet cult in the country, changing the
way people utilise it and making it a prominent part of our culture.
