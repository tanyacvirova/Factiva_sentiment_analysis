The FCC Technological Advisory Council heard early reports from working
groups at an online meeting Tuesday. TAC Chairman Dennis Roberson warned
the COVID-19 crisis might well not be over when the group next meets
June 9. The kind of work TAC does is more important than ever, said
Roberson, executive chairman of entigenlogicTM. Last year, TAC's work
was slowed by the prolonged federal government shutdown, Roberson said.
That was "nothing compared to what we're dealing with now, of course,"
but TAC never got started until June, he said.

iWeb, AJ Bell, Vanguard and Freetrade are our favourite Isa providers
depending on how you want to invest

The best way for an investor to get the best return is to make sure they
buy a good investment for a great price. However, all of this is
meaningless if they throw away thousands of pounds on buying the wrong
Isa. Choosing who you invest with is important as the market offers a
myriad of complex deals, charges and requirements.

majority of that number, 457,000 to be exact, tuned in on TV Land.
124,000 viewers watched on the show’s nominal Pop home, and 26,000 of
those viewers came via Logo.

Movie theaters have endured world wars, depressions and recessions, and
the advent of everything from television to streaming. But COVID-19 and
the public health crisis it has generated around the globe represent an
existential threat to the cinema business like no other.

In a matter of days with the accelerating spread of the contagion, most
of the largest cinema chains announced they were going dark for six to
12 weeks, and major studios postponed the releases of tentpole films
such as “Black Widow” and “A Quiet Place Part II.” It’s unclear what
awaits these theaters when they reemerge from the unprecedented
quarantines and how severe the economic toll of the work stoppages will be.

He may not be getting all the political support, but he's sure to be
increasing his Twitter followers. The young President of El Salvador,
Nayib Bukele, has had a hectic week after he announced a drastic plan to
address the economic consequences of the pandemic: the suspension of all
basic services payments for at least three months.

The 38-year-old Representative has personally led the coronavirus
prevention campaigns, going so far as to say on social media that the
pandemic could kill more than "seven Nazi burnt offerings together."

I am a *millennial*. I am a doctor. And I am a new mother. Amid this
COVID-19 pandemic I have heard and seen numerous stories of millennials
(1982-2004) and Gen Z (2005-) who think this disease is NBD (translation
for those not in these generations: No Big Deal).

I am here to tell you something we grew up hearing, but you need to hear
again: You Matter. Your decision matters. What you do today more than
ever before will make a difference.

a right mix of anatomy and radiology in order to promulgate deeper
medical comprehension."

From peer-to-peer IOUs to international transactions, we’ve got the best
apps covered.

Banks were slow to embrace the internet, allowing a number of
third-parties to develop tools to make transferring money between people
easy and painless. Even though banks have now made money transfers
online easier, not least through apps, international payments are still
difficult to make without a third party money transfer provider.

KEY POINTS Robinhood is looking to rebuild trust with users by offering
credits to some customers affected by recent trading outages. The
start-up also said it has fixed engineering flaws that led to those
glitches. The start-up saw multiple outages in March that caused traders
to miss out on a historic market rally. “An apology alone won’t rebuild
your trust in us. Instead, we hope our actions will,” Robinhood told
some clients in an email Monday. In this photo illustration a Robinhood

As more and more of the world falls under coronavirus shutdown, many
Americans are turning to the internet for daily needs: ordering
groceries and household necessities through delivery
services[https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/16/tech/amazon-shipping-coronavirus/index.html]
like FreshDirect, Amazon, Peapod and even restaurant wholesalers. But
not everyone knows how to access those services -- and even the people
who do have not always been able to use them, as competing orders crowd
delivery times and empty stockrooms.

New Delhi, March 25 -- Sreyoshi Maitra, head of shopper insights and
executive director, market strategy and understanding, at research firm
Ipsos India insists that Generation Z (15-25 years) is very different
from the earlier consumer cohort, the millennials. She finds Gen Z more
grounded and balanced. She backs her theory with the latest research
Ipsos has done in collaboration with Isobar, the digital agency of
Dentsu Aegis Network.

Gen Z's life choices are distinct from those of the millennials though
marketers, so far, have clubbed the two groups together. Maitra and
Isobar's chief operating officer Gopa Kumar studied these groups for
their clients, keen to understand Gen Z's preferences, motivations and
passions.

It was thought that after the expansion of coronavirus through Asia and
Europe, the next continent with the most cases would be Africa, by
proximity and in general because of the fragility of its health system.
However, the pandemic has begun to spread its tentacles across the
Americas, with the United States as the new epicenter of the Covid-19,
with 55,000 infected and more than 700 dead. What about Latin America?
In its Tuesday editorial, Spanish newspaper El País projected an
apocalyptic outlook in the region: "In the coming days and weeks, the
coronavirus will hit Latin America hard. Data and curves indicate that
the pandemic will grow at rates similar to those seen before in Asia and
Europe.

There is a difference between watching programmes with your children
that they like, and watching a show that you all enjoy equally on its
own terms. The following list is not of the best shows to plonk your
children in front of so you can read the papers in peace, but of shows
you might all get into watching together. Some are appropriate for the
youngest junior-school minds; others are ones you would only watch with
your teenage kids (the certificates given here are a guideline).
Remember, the family that watches together, stays together.

MUMBAI: With mass engaging content to the most riveting shows, Pocket
Aces, India’s leading digital entertainment company witnessed a
remarkable growth in 2019 paving the way to achieve higher benchmarks.

long-standing partnership with Dewar’s, which has been amongst the few
players in the alcohol-beverage industry to acknowledge the
unprecedented opportunity of marketing by targeting the LDA+
*millennial* audience with branded content. With both the brands aiming
to target the quality experience seekers and progressive minds of today,
this made for an ideal partnership for the two brands. Dewar's found the
perfect way to cement its double aging product proposition through
'Double Is Better' in a playful and culturally relevant manner which
helped in increasing the brand's awareness via a line up of engaging
content on Pocket Aces’ channels.

The recent addition of cookbooks by black authors to mainstream
bookstore shelves reflects the demand for South African food and cooking
culture in the country.

When South African food icon Dorah Sitole published Cooking from Cape to
Cairo: A Taste of Africa in 1999, she was excited to be a pioneer for
black chefs in South Africa. She did not expect to be one of the only
ones for years to come.

The baby boom generation - ‘boomers' - are being forced to adjust to
*millennial* living, which means demographics managers can capitalise on
the changing circumstances presented by containment, Declia's Clément
Maclou has said.

In a market update, Maclou said the Geneva-based asset manager is making
the most of the Decalia Millennials strategy, as various age groups get
used to being confined in their houses across Europe.

As the Trump administration pleads with Generation Z and millennials to
follow social distancing guidelines, it appears they are taking a page
from the Obama-era playbook as coronavirus task force members are
appearing on platforms beyond the usual network television and print
outlets to target young people.

The efforts come midway through the administration's 15-day push to slow
the spread of the novel coronavirus in the United States through social
distancing practices.

We get it. Covid-19 is delivering a smart kick in the communal backside.
No part of our lives remains untouched. We are levelled. We are
isolated, shrouded in dread, grieving for the time and the hugs of loved
ones that are lost to us for now.

It's hardly surprising if the loss is felt more keenly by older
generations. Many of these are individuals who never saw themselves as
"elderly" but now see time galloping away. Vulnerabilities are suddenly
laid bare. Lives already fraying a little round the edges, lives already
punctuated by loss and grief, lives already a little cluttered with
hospital appointments that rarely end in great news were nonetheless
lives that seemed grand, or at least manageable enough for their owners,
until stamped with the label, "elderly with underlying conditions".

NEW YORK, March 24, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- With the closing of all public
places, the nation is starved for more fresh, relatable online content.
L.A.-based comedians Megan Nager and Jordana Lilly have everyone
covered. Their up-and-coming, Jewish comedy-rap duo, B**** Mitzvah,
released their second music video and original song, "Bandwagon
Activists". B**** Mitzvah specializes in comedy through social
commentary, and Bandwagon is no exception.

The song is an expose of the *Millennial* generation's obsession with
being as "woke" and politically informed as possible. It directly
satirizes the hypocrisy behind a great deal of social activism.

There’s a hard rule in newspapers: no ads, no paper. With yesterday’s
announced closure of the independently-owned Sunraysia
Daily[https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-24/coronavirus-has-impact-on-local-newspapers/12084548]
we can see what this means amid the spread of COVID-19 -- the end of print.

The Mildura paper is the first daily paper to close in 30 years. It
won’t be the last. It’s all but impossible to see many of Australia’s
print newspapers surviving the great disruption being wrought by the
coronavirus pandemic and by the concurrent jackpot of advertising
collapse, social closing, restrictions on travel and government
vandalising of public broadcasting that threatens the infrastructure of
Australia’s media.

Whether you're looking to completely overhaul your bathroom or just
looking to make some minor adjustments, this season brings with it fresh
ideas, along with enduring layouts which will suit your needs and
design. Wesley Sinclair from Highgrove Bathrooms offers these tips.

Bright and white. It's true that white tiles are timeless and classy,
but sometimes overdone. However, with different textures and patterns to
choose from, the classic white tile can be transformed into a refreshing
design feature. Opting for a uniquely patterned white tile will reinvent
a traditional look to produce a modern, fresh and innovative style.

The much-loved *millennial* star Tiger Shroff who is best known for his
down to earth nature took to his Insta stories to give his best wishes
to his hairstylist Amit Yashwant. The actor shared a couple of pictures
with the birthday boy and penned down a heart-warming message for him.
The action hero shared pictures wherein his hairstylist can be seen
styling the actor's hair. He captioned one of the pics, "Thank you for
all your hard work bhai".Check out the pics: Meanwhile, Tiger Shroff was
last seen in Ahmed Khan's directorial 'Baaghi 3' alongside Shraddha
Kapoor. The film was earning a good business at the box office, however,
due to the outbreak of Coronavirus Pandemic, the government officials
decided to shut down theatres until further notice. This has highly
affected the collection of the film. The makers are now thinking to
re-release the film at the theatres, once everything gets back to normal.

"I've been preparing my whole life for this," Mum laughs on the phone.
She's referring to the ability she, my siblings and I have, to devour
large portions of food - on many an occasion. Not the genetic gift I
hoped for.

But she wasn't just talking about large stomachs. My mother is an
innovator in crisis. She knows how to ration, to budget and which cloth
to wash and reuse for number twos when panic shoppers have taken the
last roll.

The release on Friday of an ABC News/Ipsos poll indicating that 55
percent of Americans
[https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/poll-majority-of-americans-now-approve-of-trumps-coronavirus-management-138570]
approved of Donald Trump’s handling of the coronavirus—12 points higher
than the previous week—prompted another round of fatalistic chatter in
certain quarters of the political establishment. Shocked by Trump’s
victory in 2016, some left-leaning commentators and rank-and-file
Democrats alike have been steeling themselves for his reelection in
2020, noting that most presidents win second terms; that, at least
before the pandemic, the economy was humming along; and more recently
that, during moments of national disaster, Americans tend to rally
around the leader they have.

It was hardly  a month ago that prime minister Narendra Modi’s image
appeared to be taking  a beating what with the nation getting divided
between those pro-NRC and pro-CAA and those against the two proposed
measures to curb illegal immigrants. Marches, followed by clashes, the
anger that those participating in them demonstrated, and the
government’s I-can’t-hear-you-response to the protests made the
headlines. And a tirade of criticism against Modi and his men rained
from all sides.

Clearly, the government led by Modi appeared to be stumbling –
alienating a sizable portion of the population, especially the younger,
and possibly the pseudo secular lot. The economy was not doing well
either, with companies unable to pay back loans, banks getting sick with
undigestable assets, and overall economic growth slowing down.  The
sentiment was downright negative.

As the global coronavirus pandemic has heightened the pressure for all
industries to demonstrate corporate social responsibility, the beauty
industry is feeling intensified scrutiny.

One of the first beauty brands to announce it was closing physical
stores in the U.S. was
Glossier[https://www.glossy.co/beauty/store-closures-and-canceled-in-store-services-put-the-pressure-on-digital-beauty],
on March 12. The company made sure to simultaneously announce that it
would continue paying staff. The brand has since made the decision to
keep stores closed through April 10, with continued compensation for its
retail team through that time, according to the company. Canadian beauty
company Deciem released an announcement on Instagram on March 15 that it
would be closing all its physical locations worldwide that day: “Our
loving team will be paid for their time as normal,” a post stated.

On a cold day in early February, thousands of people crammed themselves
into the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City and spent two hours
cheering (and jeering) as 12 people played video games on a stage.

It was one of the first matches of the season for the Overwatch League —
essentially the NBA for competitive playing of the enormously popular
2015 shooter game Overwatch — between the New York Excelsior and the
Boston Uprising and it had all the hallmarks of the season opener for
any sports league: Fans decked out in their team colors and jerseys,
spirited commentators fawning over impressive plays and generous chants
of “Boston sucks.”

Runway shows are off. Stores are closed. But we still have TV.

There is no live fashion to look at now. No shows; no red carpets; not
really any street style. The cruise collections that normally take place
in far-flung destinations during May and June have been canceled.

Pia Loeb has been waking up restless at 5 a.m., her mind swirling with
questions about where her mother should live and how to keep her young
family safe from the coronavirus – although it sometimes seems like
she’s the only one of them worrying.

Until last week, her septuagenarian mother was still playing tennis in
her thrice-weekly clinic. And on the same day she was pleading with her
mother over the phone to stay put at home in her apartment in New York’s
Westchester County, Ms. Loeb found out her tween daughter, who was sent
to school to pick up her things before it shuttered and come right home,
had instead gone to the local shopping center with a group of friends.

Latin America's presidents spent the previous week implementing
isolation measures in the face of the wave of COVID-19 cases that began
to be presented massively in the region, however, The President of
Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador was internationally criticized for
failing to decree isolation measures even though the country has a
higher number of cases compared to others that did implement mandatory
quarantine.

López Obrador decreed phase 2 on Tuesday morning, which includes the
suspension of mass events and non-priority activities, as well as other
measures by the population.

The first person to use the cliché “the show must go on” did not reckon
with the coronavirus pandemic. Venues for the performing arts have gone
dark. As with the absence of professional sports, the absence of
theatre, opera, ballet and other genres only serves to emphasize what a
vital role they play in a civilized society.

The performing arts in general are a kind of palliative, fighting off
the despair that is inspired by the random malevolence of plague,
pestilence and pandemic. They are order, beauty and joy combating the
meaninglessness that the pandemic represents. Science be damned, some
might say, it is the arts that will save us.

2020 MAR 24 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at
China Weekly News -- Current study results on Science - Earth Science
have been published. According to news reporting originating in
Guangzhou, People's Republic of China, by VerticalNews journalists,
research stated, "Catastrophic events often interrupt long-term Earth
surface processes. In coastal areas, although *millennial*-scale trends
of climatic and sea-level changes determine the trajectory of
sedimentary landform evolution, storm and/or tsunami activity can cause
abrupt changes in depositional conditions that may alter the long-term
sedimentary processes."

Funders for this research include Research Grant Council of Hong Kong,
Guangdong Academy of Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of
China, Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, Science,
Technology & Innovation Commission of Guangzhou Municipality.

It isn’t stealing when people voluntarily give you something in exchange
for something else. (Youtube)By Kody Jensen

Well you didn’t make those widgets, did you? Because you employed
thousands of people and paid them less than a living wage to make those
widgets for you. You didn’t make those widgets, you sat on a couch while
thousands of people were paid modern-day slave wages. And in some cases,
(…) real modern-day slavery, depending on where you are in terms of food
production. You made that money off the backs of undocumented people,
(…) black and brown people being paid under a living wage, (…) single
mothers and all these people who are literally dying because they can’t
afford to live. And so, no one ever makes a billion dollars. You take a
billion dollars.

Blunderachievers: Typo jokes from Week 1369

"Gosh. Crafting a joke is way harder than making puns," noted one
longtime Loser with hundreds of inks to his name … who didn't get ink
this week. True enough, the challenge of Week 1369 — to tell a joke
involving a typo or misheard word — proved impossibly daunting to all
but a few Loserly efforts. In fact, some of the funnier tales turned out
to be true.

Growers of fresh-market citrus already know the last couple years have
challenged their profitability. As harvest continues across California,
growers were told by industry leaders recently that there's not much
light at the end of the tunnel.

Four of the industry's chief executives sat for an hour-long discussion
with California Citrus Mutual President Casey Creamer at CCM's recent
Citrus Showcase in Visalia. The prepared questions elicited tough
responses growers needed to hear about the state of their industry.

When Anindya Dutta and Sandeep Dalmia started Stanza Living about four
years ago, the plan was to plug what they believed was a yawning gap in
India’s student housing market. The near absence of organised players in
the space and the unabated inflow of migrant students into large cities
made a coliving platform that targeted such students just the solution
the market needed.

Dutta and Dalmia, roommates from business school at IIM Ahmedabad, got
off the ground  in April 2017 with a 100-bed facility in Delhi
University’s North Campus, which has an influx of migrant students every
year.

BETHESDA, Md., March 24, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Generali Global Assistance
(GGA), the developer of a proprietary and innovative identity and cyber
protection platform, today published a white paper titled, "Seniors &
Millennials: Uncovering the Likeness & Disparities in Today's Digital
Age", in conjunction with the Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC), a
nationally recognized non-profit organization established to support
victims of identity theft.

GGA and the ITRC polled 1,509 seniors and 1,510 millennials to gain a
better understanding of how each subset of society protects their data
in today's digital age. The whitepaper notes that while there are some
important differences between seniors and millennials, there are
oft-overlooked similarities that unite the two groups, and neither is
immune to partaking in risky digital behaviors.

In his 1977 chairman's letter to stockholders, Berkshire Hathaway CEO
Warren Buffett advised that costs in the insurance sector were expected
to rise. One reason he offered was "social inflation," which he
described as "a broadening definition by society and juries of what is
covered by insurance policies." Then, in the mid-1980s, as asbestos
suits proliferated, a top insurance executive bemoaned the then-current
climate and commented, "The underlying and most dramatic cause of this
insurance crisis is the wave of social inflation that has all but
engulfed our system of jurisprudence ... The mood of society is to seek
a culprit for all of life's mishaps and to look to the insurance
companies with the deep pockets to reward victims."

With the second decade of this century the times historically marked by
philosophers begin: millenarian times. They made their entrance in the
cruellest and most brutal way we could imagine: a microscopic organism
(science still debates whether one can consider a living being) needed
only 100 days to bring the whole planet to his knees, without
distinction of race, money or ideologies. He put us all, without
exception, on the same level of fragility and death.

Is it Mandinga's thing or wise nature?

For her outstanding career as a storyteller, the Zacatecan Amparo Dávila
was awarded the Jorge Ibarg-engesoitia Prize for Literature, awarded by
the University of Guanajuato, and which was to be delivered in the
context of her book fair, postponed due to the contingency by Covid-19.

At the age of 92, Dávila is recognized, according to the jury, "for the
broad prestige as dean of the Mexican tale, because any list of names of
classical storytellers in Mexico includes it in an obligatory way:
indisputably her proposal is a contribution to the universe of the
literary genre, producing an essential work in Mexican literature and
undoubted echoes in fantasy storytelling in the Spanish language, inside
and outside Mexico".

I'm hosting my own virtual dinner party

Last Saturday, I attended a dinner party in Homer Simpson slippers. It's
been a fantasy of mine for years and didn't disappoint. Rather than be
distracted by my throbbing high-heeled feet, I was able to immerse
myself almost fully in the other guests' conversation. Almost, because I
couldn't help wondering what they were wearing on their feet.

Harshad Daswani, founder of The Beach Company, on playing with
accessories for your business look. My first suit I was 14 years old and
it was a family wedding. It was exciting as everyone was buying clothes.
My first suit was from Raymond and the process of the master tailor
taking measurements was very amusing. From then to now I have many
suits, but not that many styles. They are mostly all classic. But I like
playing with shades of grey and blue in my fabric choices. Not an
everyday affair In the *millennial* work era, suits have become
redundant. But I enjoy wearing my sports jackets or blazers to work
meetings or business travels, always over a white shirt. I have moved
from the western jacket /shirt suits to more Indian dressing for social
affairs. My shopping haunt All my suits are now from Zegna. I find their
cuts and styling very smart. An extra touch Pocket squares are my
favourite accessories for the suit. Pair it with… My Tod’s Gommino loafers.

“Whadda you mean they’re closing the pub? It’s the only place left you
can nick toilet paper from!” It was 19 hours after Scott Morrison had
announced a real-life Pub With No Beer (And No Customers) and the news
had reached the tradies two doors down.

The rest of their exasperated response about no 3pm knock-off brews is
rather unprintable. As was mine when I discovered on day one of working
from home that my neighbours were using these unprecedented times to
renovate.
