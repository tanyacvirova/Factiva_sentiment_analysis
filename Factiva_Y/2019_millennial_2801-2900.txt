The advertisements that appear on the websites you use each day
certainly look legitimate, but some of them may actually expose your
computer to malware. You've seen them — we all have. If you click on
them, you end up with a fill form that requests your personal email
address or a pop-up that asks you to spin a wheel for the chance to win
some fictional prize.

The "bad ads" are known in the media industry as "malvertisements," and
a Baltimore adtech startup called Clean Creative is focused specifically
on protecting internet publishers and users from them.

*HD* 	‘Boomerang’ Review: BET’s Chill Sequel Series Is Less Outrageous,
More Nuanced Than Its Charming Predecessor

Eddie Murphy’s 1992 romantic comedy “Boomerang” begat BET’s new sequel
series, which doesn’t share its predecessor’s outrageous brand of humor.
Instead, the new “Boomerang” is the epitome of *Millennial* cool —
stylish and ambitious, but not willing to be defined in any traditional way.

In the original film, womanizing ad exec Marcus Graham (Eddie Murphy)
has the tables turned on him by his co-worker Jacqueline (Robin Givens),
who then becomes his superior. Eventually, he falls for the talented
artist Angela (Halle Berry). At the time, the film was a revelation of
representation — depicting black excellence in a hilarious, heightened
environment and boasting a killer supporting cast, including Martin
Lawrence, David Alan Grier, Grace Jones, John Witherspoon, Eartha Kitt,
and Chris Rock.

Walmart is big in almost every way-4,755 stores, 1.5 million employees
and $380 billion in revenue in the U.S. alone. But one part of the
world's largest retailer remains minuscule.

"We have a tiny ad business," Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon told
investors in October. "It could be bigger."

Ashcroft Cache Creek Journal -- The Better Business Bureau (BBB) serving
Mainland B.C. has not yet released its list of the Top 10 scams of 2018,
but Karla Davis, manager of community and public relations for the BBB
serving Mainland B.C., says she would not be surprised to see the Canada
Revenue Agency (CRA) scam make the list once more (it was number six in
2017). And as British Columbians head into the heart of tax season, they
should brace not only for the scam to ramp up, but for scammers to
become more sophisticated.

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is once again under fire
this Oscar season after announcing February 11 the four categories that
will be cut from airing during the live broadcast on ABC: Best
Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Live Action Short, and Best Makeup
and Hairstyling. The initiative was first announced last summer on the
same day the Academy tried and failed to introduce the Best Popular Film
Oscar, but outrage over the decision has hit a fever pitch now that the
cut categories are confirmed. Guillermo del Toro, winner of Best
Director and Best Picture for “The Shape of Water” last year, led the
charge on social media.

“If I may: I would not presume to suggest what categories to cut during
the Oscars show but – Cinematography and Editing are at the very heart
of our craft,” del Toro wrote on Twitter. “They are not inherited from a
theatrical tradition or a literary tradition: they are cinema itself.”

EXCLUSIVE: Everyone has been back from Sundance long enough that sinuses
are returning to normal and the high-altitude respiratory distress is a
distant memory. But deals keep dropping for festival films. Hulu has
just acquired U.S. rights to the Liza Mandelup-directed documentary
Jawline, which won the Special Jury Prize for Emerging Filmmaker at
Sundance. The film premiered there in the U.S. Documentary competition.

It becomes the second Sundance docu deal for Hulu, which paid $2 million
for The Untitled Amazing Johnathan Documentary.

Perhaps the last thing one would expect, in a film that, among other
things, playfully weighs the artistic expressiveness of cinema against
that of literature, is for the film to come down pretty definitively on
the side of the written word. But that is just one of the mischiefs that
Peter Parlow’s 76-minute lower-than-lo-fi “The Plagiarists” works on us
— and with such conviction that even the convention of attributing the
film solely to its director feels wrong here. Filmmaker and artist James
N. Kienitz Wilkins vies for authorship too, credited as co-writer of the
springy, self-aware script (with Robin Schavoir), as well as DP,
producer, and editor. Wilfully student-video amateurish in form, but
impishly sophisticated in content, a gleeful cultural curiosity fairly
crackles off “The Plagiarists,” and it is highly contagious.

MUMBAI: Mars Wrigley Confectionery India today launched a new variant of
its much loved chocolate brand SNICKERS(R). The all new SNICKERS(R)
ALMONDS offers a base of nougat and crushed almonds, topped with a layer
of diced almond mixed with caramel and enrobed with chocolate.

Traditionally associated with boosting brain power, Almonds have always
been a favourite of every Indian home. SNICKERS(R) ALMOND builds on this
and highlights that hunger leads to forgetfulness which further leads to
all kinds of irresponsible behavior. Therefore for every hungry brain
SNICKERS(R) ALMOND is the answer.

You have until March 1 to put money into a registered retirement savings
plan and get a refund on your 2018 income taxes.

I'm a believer. After opening an RRSP in my 20s, I made regular
contributions and learned how to invest in the stock market with a
financial adviser at one of Canada's bank-owned brokerages.

LOU DOBBS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good evening, everybody. The
bipartisan border security conference committee has finally reached an
agreement. It is a pitiable product, even by the low standards of the
indolent and incompetent Senators and Congressmen devoting no more than
two workdays to their sad effort. Whatever the shortcomings of this deal
and there are many, it is what Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer intended
it to be.

An insult to President Trump and the American people. The purported
agreement, we still have not seen it is a bill that will not only rankle
the White House, the American people, it makes a mockery of the word
compromise. Given the President just about 25percent of the money he
demanded for construction of the border wall. He asked for 5.7 billion.
The committee coming up with 1.37 billion. Yes. That is 26percent of Mr.
Trump's asked.

THE Karebosi stadium in Makassar united Sandiaga Salahuddin Uno and the
Sabyan Gambus group on one stage for the first time on Saturday three
weeks ago. In front of thousands of people attending the ‘Grand
Get-Together with a Million Stars’ event, the running mate of
presidential candidate Prabowo Subianto praised the group’s lead
vocalist Khoirunnisa.

Sandiaga said he was touched by Khoirunnisa’s songs, such as Deen
Assalam, which has over 200 million YouTube views. “This goes across
ethnicity, people and religions. I am moved to hear the lyrics in
Sabyan’s beautiful voice,” Sandiaga said.

Nearly a year after a gunman massacred 17 students and staffers at a
Parkland, Florida, high school, the political landscape on guns has shifted.

Dozens of lawmakers endorsed by the gun-safety group Everytown for Gun
Safety now hold seats in the US House -- many part of a freshman wave
that helped Democrats seize control of the chamber in November's midterm
elections. More than 20 states have passed some form of gun regulation
in the last year, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun
Violence. And a growing number of companies are risking customer
backlash to link their brands to the gun-safety movement.

LONDON: "And is there anything you’d like to ask us?"

It is that dreaded moment near the end of a job interview when, having
more or less kept your composure for the previous half hour, you are
invited to turn the tables and come up with an insightful, pertinent
question.

Thanks to the U.S. trade war[https://www.benzinga.com/topic/trade-war]
with China, emerging market investors haven't fared well over the past
year. Fortunately, Colliers International recently compiled a list of 10
local emerging industrial markets within the U.S.

The 10 metro markets on the Colliers list will provide the most economic
opportunity for both residents and investors in 2019, according to James
Breeze, the firm's national director of industrial research.

1708 ET - While policymakers in Washington debate the benefits of
running higher deficits, the national debt hit a milestone Monday: gross
US national debt hit $22T, the Treasury Department says. Last year's tax
overhaul and government-spending deal, combined with rising interest
rates, forced the government to ramp up borrowing in 2018. The
Congressional Budget Office expects annual deficits to top $1T starting
in 2022, and said debt will average 4.4% of GDP over the next
decade--almost unheard of during a period of sturdy economic growth and
low unemployment. The upshot: expect to keep hitting these annual
milestones for the foreseeable future. (kate.davidson@wsj.com)

The latest Market Talks covering Equities. Published exclusively on Dow
Jones Newswires throughout the day.

1456 ET - Lithium company Livent says that over the last couple of
months existing Chinese customers declined to sign contracts for lithium
hydroxide, a material used in electric vehicle batteries, at volumes and
prices they verbally agreed to weeks before. CEO Paul Graves attributes
the cold feet to uncertainty generated by a potential revamp of Chinese
government incentives for electric vehicles. Customers wanted lower
prices, with some abruptly halting talks after seeking discounts, he
says. Macro-economic factors also played a role in the shift in
sentiment, according to Graves. China's economy has been slowing amid a
trade fight with the US. Shares fall 5.6%. (micah.maidenberg@wsj.com,

There is no battle more lonely and one-sided than the one where an
individual customer pursues a complaint against a mega-corporation like
a bank, telecom company or airlines.

You have to find the right place to begin the complaint process and then
navigate it through a system that is often designed to make you give up
and go away. If your complaint is dismissed, you’ve got to find a way to
escalate the matter.

It's no longer just a *millennial* eating fad - the older generation is
jumping on the bandwagon, too, discovers Lucy Holden

It's getting harder to escape veganism. Time was when plant-only diets
were for young, idealistic world-changers. But, thanks to the popularity
of initiatives such as Veganuary, there's a new breed of meat and dairy
dodgers: vegan OAPs.

1304 ET - Vivendi's Universal Music Group is acquiring independent label
distributor and services company Ingrooves Music Group. A minority
investor in the company since 2006, the world's largest music company
will buy the remainder--some 80%--in a bid to strengthen its position in
the independent market. Ingrooves's 2% US market share, which was
already counted toward Universal's overall share, will now belong fully
to UMG, which says it will form a strategic partnership between its
Caroline International independent music and distribution company and
Ingrooves. Terms weren't disclosed; industry trade magazine Billboard
last year reported shareholders were asking for around $100M. Growing
and holding market share has become increasingly important for labels as
streaming has grown to become the industry's main source of revenue.

13:00 ET - Seeking to capture a larger share of the business-travel
market, HotelTonight goes head-to-head with Expedia and Booking Holdings
units by launching multiroom booking. The move would help San
Francisco-based HotelTonight expand beyond its largely *millennial*
customer base, who scout for last-minute deals, typically in urban
business districts. Airbnb has held talks to acquire HotelTonight as
part of a bid to bolster offerings and make itself more attractive to
investors ahead of an eventual IPO, WSJ has reported, citing people
familiar with the matter. (aisha.al-muslim@wsj.com; @aishaalmuslim)

YouTube and its stars do not escape the arrows of Cupid, some youtubers
usually share their privacy to such a degree that their relationships
are almost part of the content they upload to their channels and
official accounts.

Celebrities from the *millennial* world such as Yuya, Beto Pasillas, Pao
Poulain, Sergio Castrejon and Gabriel Montiel ('Werevertumorro') are
just some of the vloggers who will not be in solitude on February 14th.

While urban streetwear brands have yet to make a big comeback, they have
popped up on a few runways. For his spring 2019 show, Kerby Jean-Raymond
of Pyer Moss worked with Fubu and Cross Colours, and for its spring 2019
show, Études, which is based in Paris, partnered with Karl Kani on a
capsule.

Kani, who started his line in 1989 and still sells it, is one of the few
urban streetwear designers who has appealed to a new customer by
partnering with other brands. Earlier this year he released his second
collection with PrettyLittleThing, the affordable retailer that’s part
of the Manchester, England-based Boohoo.com plc and targets *Millennial*
women. And now he’s doing something more high-end with Études.

their commitment to financial minimalism . The approach involves
decluttering accounts, obligations and balance sheets.

Women are forging a new way of working, designed to suit them. From a
*millennial* members' club to a guerrilla cyber support network, Phoebe
Luckhurst speaks to the CEOs creating a more equal future for everybody

ONCE upon a time, "boys' club" operated as a noun; now it functions more
like a slur. In these new times — times of #MeToo and a pantomime
villain of a pussy-grabbing President — the term conjures a sense of
exclusivity and purchased privilege. It suggests status quo, not forward
motion; it calls to mind a subtext of misogyny — like a stag do, but in
suits. Time's up on alpha culture.

By David Escobar Galindo, writer Salvadorans have all the accumulated
conditions to be builders of destiny. The only thing that is required is
that we strip ourselves of all the artifices that surround us to be free
in the effort to be better every day. What is perceived in relation to
what is happening in this field is that politics is exposed to a
challenge that presents very peculiar characteristics, which derive both
from the conditions of the environment and from the aspirations to
improve them. In this sense, they are making themselves feel some
factors that should not be left aside under any argument or excuse. One
of those factors is the frustration that has been permeating the
citizen's spirit in what corresponds to the performance of politics and
politicians; another is the need to adapt to the changes brought about
by the globalizing dynamics; and one more is the evolution of
responsibility as inexcusable computer element.

The latest Market Talks covering Equities. Published exclusively on Dow
Jones Newswires throughout the day.

0803 ET - Just Eat investors have plenty to look forward to in 2019, but
the market is too pessimistic about the U.K. online food-delivery
company, UBS says. The company's current share price means the market is
attributing little value to its assets outside of the U.K. and Canada,
which seems excessively conservative given that its stake in Brazil's
iFood alone could be worth as much as GBP750 million, UBS says. A
potential sale of Latin American assets would deliver value, the bank
says. In the meantime, Just Eat is feeling the pain of its investment in
delivery services, the bank says. (adria.calatayudvaello@dowjones.com)

1213 GMT - Kering shares trade higher after falling in opening trade,
and Citi analyst Thomas Chauvet credits a reassuring conference call
after 2018 results for this course reversal. Management comments that
trends were in line with 4Q at Gucci and that demand from China and the
U.S. remains strong should relieve investors, Citi says. "Over the past
year, investors' concerns have emerged on how the Gucci brand would
evolve from a potentially repetitive style and stay relevant in a highly
competitive environment, in particular to the *millennial* consumers,"
Citi says. Kering trades 3% higher at EUR464.30.

Rosina Bosco and her then-husband were like many couples she saw on
Facebook.They regularly posted photos on vacations, at concerts and of
the activities they did together.Her social media feeds were always
bombarded with images of friends getting together and having families.
"All you see on social media is weddings and babies," she said.So when
it came to updating her profiles after her divorce, it was "incredibly
painful." "All of a sudden I have to basically shed half of my world,"
said Bosco, 34. "Five years of our relationship was up on Facebook.
Like, what are you supposed to do?"

A friend came over one day to go through it. "She would say a name, and
I would say, 'yes,' and she would de-friend them," Bosco said. For
photos, the task became too challenging, so she created a new profile.

Gold seems to be out of favor, but that's only compared to the U.S. dollar.

Over the past two decades, the commodity has actually seen a widespread,
strong, and sustained value appreciation around the globe against 72
currencies, according to Ross Norman, CEO of London-based bullion broker
Sharps Pixley. That basket of currencies includes developed countries
such as Canada, Australia, and Japan, as well as emerging markets
including Brazil, India, and Iran. "Using the dollar gold price, as most
of us do, has disguised what is actually quite a powerful bull market,"
Norman wrote in a note last week.

[STANDFIRST] She may be a relative newcomer to the small screen but Emma
Appleton, 27, shines in the title role for post-wartime spy thriller,
Traitors. She tells Gemma Dunn more about her character Feef, who having
joined the Civil Service in 1945, agrees to spy on her own government on
behalf of the Americans.

HOW WOULD YOU SUMMARISE TRAITORS - AND YOUR ROLE?

The world is facing unprecedented "environmental breakdown" which could
threaten the stability of societies, a report from a think tank warns.

Climate change and damage to land, soil, air, water and animal
populations are happening at such a scale and pace that the window to
prevent catastrophe is closing, the report from the Institute for Public
Policy Research (IPPR) said.

...or proof today's top models are clones of the originals

WHEN pictures of Carla Bruni from her modelling heyday were juxtaposed
with those of Bella Hadid on Instagram last week, the striking likeness
left many social media users adjusting their screens in disbelief. Carla
has joked she has a 'hidden daughter', while Bella posted a picture of a
younger Carla in tribute. But the supermodel similarities do not end
with Carla and Bella. Here, ANTONIA HOYLE presents the catwalk queens

One of the most controversial films ever made has been approved for
release in the UK despite featuring self-harm, suicide and burning of
churches by members of a satanic black metal band.

Official film classifiers in the UK
[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/06/21/films-sexual-violence-will-get-18-ratings-metoo-backlash/]
and US are understood to have been so concerned about the release of
Lords of Chaos that it was reviewed at the highest levels and suicide
prevention experts were consulted before it was approved for an 18
certificate.

2.5 to 7.4 per 100,000 in a decade.

The growing prevalence of the disease among younger Scots comes at a
time when overall incidence is falling. In the decade to 2016 – the most
recent year for which data is available – there was a 15 per cent
decline in the total number of bowel cancer diagnoses in Scotland, to 3,700.

India, Feb. 12 -- Thomas Cook (India) has witnessed a significant demand
for Valentine's Day- upwards of 27%. The company's data highlights that
while demand for romantic destinations such as France, Switzerland,
Italy, Bali, Langkawi (Malaysia), Mauritius and Maldives continues to
grow, it is non-standard destinations, such as Korea, Japan, Fiji,
Reunion Island, Morocco, Tunisia, Hungary, Czech Republic, Greece and
South Africa that are seeing significant interest. From an India
perspective, destinations like Dharmshala, Manali, Kerala, Goa,
Dalhousie and Udaipur feature as favourites.

This year, Valentine's Day has seen significant uptake from India's
*millennial* segment and DINK/SINK (Double/Single Income No Kids)
couples; millennials leading with a 47% contribution to Thomas Cook
India's booking pie.

Raphael Samuel's beard is clearly fake. In one photograph, his eyes are
covered with what looks like a little girl's little bra. On his Facebook
page, quixotically named Nihilanand, he has posts with in-your-face
statements like Your parents had you instead of a toy or a dog, and You
owe them nothing.

One irate post demands - Why should I suffer? Why must I be stuck in
traffic? Why must I work? Why must I face wars? Why must I feel pain or
depression? Why should I do anything when I don't want to? Many
questions, one answer: Someone had you for their "pleasure".

when it comes to working with women and more specifically, women who
have just been through a life altering event—divorce.

In two months, Indonesians will elect their next president, choosing
between the incumbent, President Joko Widodo, and ex-general Prabowo
Subianto[https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/2182689/indonesian-presidential-candidates-prabowo-subianto-and].
This is a rerun of the 2014 election, when Widodo, who quit his position
as Jakarta's governor, defeated the same rival by a 6 per cent margin.
In today's Indonesia, with its complex democracy, diverse population and
the world's largest Muslim population, this is not a mere routine at
five-year intervals. Larger issues loom over this political contest,
which might determine the country's future.

April's election will be the largest since Indonesia began the process
of democratisation in 1998, with both the presidential and legislative
polls being held at the same time across the country. What is at stake
and why?

Middle-aged Chinese travellers were the country's biggest spenders
abroad during the recent Lunar New Year holiday, as these older tourists
led the use of mobile payments to go shopping overseas, according to an
Alipay study.

That finding, drawn from the more than 40 markets where Alipay is
accepted, covered two groups who used the popular mobile payments
platform: those born in the period 1960 to 1969 and 1970 to 1979.

Indian users are willing to pay more for features, like confidentiality
and safety, only when they are looking for long-term commitment and not
for casual dating

'Swipe left' and 'swipe right' have become an integral part of
*millennial* vocabulary, thanks to the dating app Tinder. You swipe
right on someone's photo if you would consider meeting them to see if
there is some real chemistry, and swipe left if you are not interested.

With more than 30 states allowing the medicinal use of marijuana and 10
allowing fully recreational, it’s no surprise that employers are
scrambling for ways to adapt to changing regulations. Coupled with the
opioid epidemic, the intricacies of an effective drug testing program
and policy can vary based on the industry and state.

The answer might be as simple as a no-tolerance policy for some
employers, but for others the legalities are difficult to navigate.

SAN FRANCISCO — Technology start-ups worth $1 billion, once as rare as
unicorns, are now plentiful enough and old enough that there’s a new
generation behind them — one that looks very different.

Silicon Valley’s current crop of highly valued tech start-ups, which
include now-household names like Uber and Airbnb, all benefited from the
spread of smartphones and cheap cloud computing. Many of these companies
built global empires by simply taking existing businesses — like taxis,
food delivery and hotels — and making them mobile. Some of the start-ups
became giants: Uber, for instance, may reach a $120
billion[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/07/technology/uber-ipo.html]

YouTube is undeniably the world’s biggest video-sharing platform today.
Everyone is free to join, free to express whatever they want, free to
communicate with anyone - and earn money at the same time. According to
a report by digital media research company Nielsen Koreanclick in June
last year, around 25 million people - that’s half the total population
in Korea - access YouTube through their mobile phones every month.

This also explains why already-established celebrities are heading
toward the platform themselves. From K-pop stars to comedians and actors
of different ages, a number of Korean celebrities have opened their own
YouTube channels recently to engage in active communication with their
fans. Unlike in television, where they are stage-managed to behave in a
certain way, celebrities on YouTube are free to share their talent
without anyone’s permission, while receiving direct feedback from their
viewers. Through YouTube, many celebrities are now enjoying a new heyday.

After years of rolling snake eyes five of Atlantic City’s 12 casinos
were shuttered between 2009 and 2016 the mid-2018 arrival of two new
properties, the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Atlantic City, and the Ocean
Resort Casino, was welcome news. But a combination of changing
demographics, casinos opening in neighboring states Pennsylvania and New
York, and the recent legalization of online gaming, mean that casinos
have to evolve if they want to stay relevant.

Traffic as an indicator

The #MeToo movement catapulted the issues of sexual harassment and
assault into Americans' collective consciousness and forced the public
to reckon with the sexual power dynamics that have long permeated
certain industries and personal interactions.

But while the alleged sexual misconduct of film producer Harvey
Weinstein and others in niches like entertainment and politics have been
thrust into the limelight, the financial advice industry has largely
escaped a public reckoning in the #MeToo era.

*HD* 	Study says older homeowners are preventing millennials from buying
houses. But is that right?

Are senior homeowners preventing millennials from buying houses? Could
the decisions of millions of older owners to "age in place" rather than
sell their homes explain why millennials are lagging behind in
homeownership?

A provocative new study from federally chartered mortgage investor
Freddie Mac suggests the answer may be yes.

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is desperately trying to
reverse a downward ratings trend for its annual Oscars telecast. That
means going for big-name hosts like The Rock (who reportedly couldn’t
take the gig) and Kevin Hart (who accepted and then bowed out amid
controversy). It means implementing a half-baked “popular film” Oscar
that was laughed out of the building by the group’s own membership. And
it means promising a swiftly-paced three-hour telecast, whatever the
consequences.

Those consequences, it was revealed in August, included the nixing of
certain Oscar presentations from the live show, relegating them to
slimmed-down moments to be aired later in the program. Only no one knew
which categories those would be, leading to widespread anxiety (judging
by a number of artisans Variety spoke to at the annual Oscar Nominees
Luncheon last week) and a general sense of waiting for the shoe to drop.

New York County Judge Joel H. Cohen has ordered Fyre Festival founder
Billy McFarland to pay back nearly $3 million to a sponsor of the event.
A default judgement was handed out in favor of defrauded investor EHL
Funding after McFarland “failed to appear, answer or otherwise move in
this action.”

McFarland has been ordered to pay back the nearly $3 million loan plus
the contractually stipulated 30 percent interest. EHL Funding is also
requesting that McFarland reimburse its attorney fees.
