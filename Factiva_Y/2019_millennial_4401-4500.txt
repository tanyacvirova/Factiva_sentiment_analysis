Larry Fink, the investment manager who oversees nearly $6 trillion at
BlackRock, set off a yearlong conversation among business leaders and
policymakers last January when he wrote a letter to chief executives
declaring that companies needed to do more than make profits.

Mr. Fink wrote that it was crucial that businesses also made “a positive
contribution to society” — and that he planned to hold them to account.

Every year, in late December, as the solstices approach — winter or
summer, depending on your hemisphere — the
design-trends-for-the-next-year articles appear, as if to beat the new
year deadline. This false urgency exaggerates their significance: these
aren’t catastrophic, black-swan events (wholly unpredictable — until
they happen!) but slow processes already in motion. These “trends” are
tendentious and exist only in the eye of the observer. They are a form
of navel gazing, a year-end meditation when we pause to be
communitarian, and give thanks. And to indulge our need to see our
biases confirmed (I told you so).

With those warnings, here’s what we saw in the Deep Design of
trends-for-2019, and a speculative interpretation thereof. Call it a
trend of trends.

Americans are increasingly laying off the booze, prompting the world’s
biggest brewers and liquor companies to push beyond their traditional
fare and roll out teas, energy drinks and non-alcoholic spirits.

New data shows that US alcohol volumes dropped 0.8 per cent last year,
slightly steeper than the 0.7 per cent decline in 2017. Beer was worst
hit, with volumes down 1.5 per cent in 2018, compared with a 1.1 per
cent decline in 2017, while growth in wine and spirits slowed, according
to data compiled for The Wall Street Journal by industry tracker IWSR.

Quelle horreur! Fifty-year-old Gallic literary prince declares women his
own age too old to bother with. "The body of a 25-year-old woman is
extraordinary,"

announces Yann Moix. "The body of a woman of 50 is not extraordinary at
all." Cue outrage, derision and, oh, lots of publicity as he launches a
new book.

Fellow millennials, deny it all you want: we're all suckers for a good
trend.

From avocado toast and brunching, to Uber Eats and a penchant for blush
pink interiors, I'm sure even the most hipster of deniers have at least
jumped on one *millennial* bandwagon at some point in their lives.

We praise our literature, television shows and politicans for being
relatable - but why should we want to see ourselves everywhere we look.

In 2007, Jonah Peretti, the co-founder and chief executive of BuzzFeed,
wrote a manifesto about what could make something go viral, years before
anyone knew what "going viral" meant. He detailed this method of content
delivery as a "form of pop conceptual art" that should represent the
"simplest form of the idea" - something anyone could understand. Any
small cabal of aesthetes could declare some artwork a success, but for
Peretti, what mattered most was how many eyeballs it eventually
received. "If people don't share the work with their friends," he wrote,
"it is a failure regardless of the creator, the critics or the other
elites."

The city of Atlanta issued $5.6 billion in construction permits last
year, a record that reflects its historic period of job and population
growth.

"It's quite extraordinary," said Steve Brock, president of Brock Built
homes, one of the city's top home-builders.

The tech executive on surviving disruption, politics as combat and
taking on Netflix

The first thing I notice about Meg Whitman is her hands. The former head
of legacy tech giant Hewlett-Packard, the chief executive who took eBay
from a start-up to a multi­billion-dollar ecommerce giant, and the
one-time Republican candidate for governor of California comes across at
first meeting just as you’d expect — confident, cool and in control.
Classic blonde bob and conservative jewellery: check. Hyper-focused yet
friendly: check. Firmly on her talking points: check, check, check.

Though the subject matter is similar to the artist’s previous albums,
musically her latest feels very different

This third album is a marked breach with Leyla McCalla’s first two,
2013’s Vari-Colored Songs (a celebration of the Harlem Renaissance’s
poet-in-chief, Langston Hughes) and 2016’s acclaimed A Day for the
Hunter, A Day for the Prey, which majored on Haitian folk music. Not so
much in terms of content — Capitalist Blues still contains songs in
Creole and engages with the African-American experience — but musically.
McCalla’s signature plucked and bowed cello, which she still plays in
concert, is absent, and the musical setting owes much more to the rowdy
band environment of her current hometown, New Orleans.

Holding his jacket in one hand to diffuse the sunlight streaming through
the windows of Gram & Dun, he focuses his cracked iPhone on a plate of
cornmeal-fried catfish, with scratch-made cheesy corn filling a mini
cast-iron skillet to the side.

The image he’s about to capture has all the elements of
a captivating Instagram post. It’s a perfectly imperfect assemblage, a
few brunch menus strewn across the table, and behind the lens, there’s
Kasim Hardaway, a self-described marketing guru, food stylist and Kansas
City influencer.

Archival news report: A multistage rocket with a fuel more powerful than
anything the West has in stock puts its final stage into a
round-the-world orbit. Two things are astonishing about Sputnik 2: its
weight, more than half a ton; and its live passenger, a dog. Laika's
elliptical orbit varies from 100 to 1,000 miles above the Earth's
surface, where observatories listen eagerly for the coded radio signals
which tell the space scientists how Laika is standing up to her lonely
journey. These signals give information on the brain, respiration and
pulse of the first living being to leave Earth for outer space.

BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink said the $5.9tn fund manager will
pressure company bosses on diversity, long-term pay and bonuses and the
environment this year, in his annual letter to chief executives.

He also returned to a favourite theme: a call for companies to take more
responsibility for ensuring their workers have a good standard of living
in retirement.

Following the biggest fourth-quarter worldwide subscriber gain ever and
some controversy around increased prices in the U.S., Netflix looks to
keep its momentum going into 2019.

From Jan. 18 through March, the streaming site will release 10 original
films, including action-packed thrillers, a post-apocalyptic sci-fi,
quirky comedies, inspirational dramas, an artistic horror movie and a
viral documentary.

It is perhaps only fitting that two documentaries about the disastrous
Fyre Festival, one of the most high-profile fraudulent failures in
history, would arrive during the same week — a fitting cap on a
tragicomedy of errors that, as both films outline in excruciating
detail, unfolded like a slow-motion plane crash in the spring of 2017.
Far from the luxury accommodations and celebrity-chef-prepared meals
promised by its chief producers — entrepreneur Billy McFarland and
rapper Ja Rule — and the multiple “influencers” who were paid to promote
it, concertgoers were met with flimsy tents, boxed lunches, near-total
disorganization, a cancelled concert and long waits for flights to
return to the mainland.

Not long ago, I found myself in the south of Greenland, in a tidy
cottage at the edge of a fjord, in the company of four scientists. We
were talking about sea-level rise when one of the younger scientists
asked whether I could settle a debate: Should we keep developing nuclear
power? He thought we should. I said that I didn’t have a strong opinion,
but it seemed like a good way to produce electricity without emitting
greenhouse gases. A lot of economists seemed to think it would be
essential to fighting climate change.

The most senior scientist in the room, who had spent his life studying
the fragility of Earth’s climate, cut in. You can’t be serious, he said.
We’d learn to deal with climate change in time. But nuclear power made
nuclear waste—and that was the worst, most poisonous stuff on the planet.

Retirees relocate for lots of different reasons, from the weather to
proximity to grandchildren. Moving from a pricey part of the country to
one with low housing prices could also lower your expenses and make your
retirement savings last longer. But as you consider the cost of living
in potential retirement destinations, don't overlook the impact of state
taxes on your bottom line.

Where does your state fit in? We've ranked all 50 states, plus the
District of Columbia, based on how they tax retirees.

Last week I decided to give myself a treat. I did my hair, applied my
make-up, put on a cute outfit, and ventured out in to the city to have a
very hot date — with myself.

My first stop was a chic restaurant, a Melbourne institution known for
delicious food, hot coffee, and crisp wines. I politely requested a
table for one, but the maître d’ looked at me as though I’d requested
space on the dining floor for my pet antelope.

BUDGET accommodations platform RedDoorz targets to triple the number of
its rooms and properties within the year, as demand for the service
continues to increase with revenues from the local hospitality industry
expected to grow to $663 million in 2019.

RedDoorz COO Rishabh Singhi said his group aims to add 150 properties to
its existing 100 properties, which translates to about 7,500 rooms in
total from only 2,500 rooms today. The company essentially partners with
property owners to convert their existing rooms to standardized RedDoorz
branded rooms.

Ontario Place's landmark Cinesphere dome and futuristic pods appear
threatened by the bulldozer under Premier Doug Ford's plan to redevelop
the shuttered, once-beloved waterfront park.

The government is not, apparently, ruling out a waterfront casino, giant
Ferris wheel or megamall and hotel, attractions Ford pitched for
Toronto's downtown waterfront while he was on city council from 2010 to
2014.

Kamal Haasan’s Indian hit screens in 1996.

Roughly 22 years ago, Senapathy called IPS officer Krishnaswamy from
Hong Kong and told him that "Indian will be back", and finally it is.
Director Shankar announced recently that the shooting for Indian 2 will
begin from today. So, I decided to revisit the 1996 film Indian.

Adriano Castillo is an outstanding actor in our country, but most people
do not know him by name. And is that his nickname " Compadre Moncho ",
due to his character in the series "Los Venegas", ended up making him a
very popular television face at the country level.

And this time the outstanding performer made news, to reveal the fight
he had to give against TVN to pay him the repetitions of the series in
the last years of broadcast. Castillo said he battled for six years with
the executives of the channel to pay him a figure close to 200 million
pesos , which finally reached only a quarter of the value.

Jan 18 (Reuters) - U.S. online luxury reseller The RealReal Inc is
talking to investment banks about the possibility of an initial public
offering (IPO) later this year, people familiar with the matter said on
Friday.

The company - which specializes in online secondhand luxury apparel and
goods - has sent out a request for proposals to prospective advisors and
underwriters to manage the listing this year, said the sources, who
asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak
publicly.

It's a provocative question, but I feel compelled to ask: 40 years
later, which song holds up better: The Sex Pistol's "Anarchy in the
U.K." or Toto's "Africa"?

Yes, I know, hardcore music fans find the mere existence of Toto enough
to send them reaching for an Ativan as they adjust their torn punk
T-shirts, grunge flannels or EDM booty shorts.

We've heard of the ketogenic ("keto") diet, fermented foods, non-dairy
milks and plant proteins, but what do they all have in common? They are
some of the hottest food and nutrition trends to look for in 2019,
according to dietitians surveyed in the 7th annual Pollock
Communications and Today's Dietitian "What's Trending in Nutrition"
survey. With 1,342 registered dietitian nutritionists (RDNs) responding,
the survey divulges what leading RDNs predict consumers are thinking and
eating. While fermented foods hold steady as the #1 superfood for 2018
and 2019, some surprising newcomers have made the list, including beets,
blueberries and non-dairy milks. And in a shocking switch, RDNs predict
that a "healthy" label will begin to surpass cost and taste when it
comes to consumer purchase drivers. A not-so-surprising trend dietitians
report is the rise of keto as the most popular consumer diet, ousting
clean eating from last year's top spot, with intermittent fasting making
its debut as #2.

I recently participated in a WSHU NPR radio broadcast discussing the
*millennial* economy with men and women of the generation that will
influence events for years to come.

These millennials want jobs that match their skills and salary
requirements and are mobile enough, with information available on the
internet, that they can relocate to where those jobs are. Yet one
worried that while information sharing and having more information
available on social media is a good thing, knowing if the information is
correct opens the door for disinformation sharing.

In the 1990s, glossy magazines and supermodels were the trendsetters in
beauty and fashion. Young women emulated — or at least aspired to
emulate — the clothing and color cosmetics looks dominating the runways.
There were few other choices.

Food, drug and mass channels echoed this mantra. They offered a handful
of dominant cosmetic brands supported by mega ad campaigns featuring the
same looks and supermodels. This left little room for smaller players,
who normally lacked the funds to support top talent and big ad budgets.

job before that, my first job out of college, lasted exactly 18 months

advice on how to frame why I am looking for a new job already? I don't
want to be viewed as a job hopper.

The fine art of photography

Sebastian Smee is an award-winning art critic, but his review of the
exhibit "Ansel Adams in Our Time" at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts,
"Ansel Adams in context: An updated American landscape" [Dec. 30, Arts &
Style], showed a surprising lack of understanding of photography.

In many ways, Max is a typical 14-year-old. He eschews soft music in
favour of rock and heavy metal, likes to wear hoodies, giggles when he's
nervous and has a flair for drawing animals. He can be opinionated and
sarcastic one moment, shy and withdrawn the next.

His insecurities, however, run deeper than run-of-the-mill teenaged angst.

Coca-Cola is adding a pair of new flavors to its revitalized Diet Coke
brand.

The Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO) on Wednesday introduced Blueberry Acai and
Strawberry Guava to its expanded list of flavors for the zero-calorie
drink. The move comes one year after the Atlanta-based beverage giant
launched a "brand
rejuvenation"[https://www.bizjournals.com/triad/news/2018/01/10/coca-cola-re-brands-diet-coke-adds-four-new-bold.html]
for the soda with four flavors, new packaging and more contemporary
marketing.

Turns out that investors have limited interest in losing money — even if
an asset manager offers to do it for them for free.

But to Fidelity Investments, the first-ever purveyor of zero-fee funds,
the declining investor interest in the products’ first few months may
not matter much.

Technology has revolutio1nized businesses, providing real-time
intelligence and changing how we govern and make decisions. Cognitive
technologies like predictive analytics have mixed innovative and smart
ways of working to deliver value and results. Traditional tasks are
being greatly improved, for instance, credit analysis, transaction
processing, target marketing and fraud detection have significantly
altered. The modern Internal Audit function has to keep up with the
pace. In fact, it has to position itself ahead of the pack because it is
a key stakeholder in ensuring that complete and accurate information is
relayed to the board.

Less a comedy and more a contest to see who can make the most 1980s
jokes, Showtime's "Black Monday" would be better if it would just slow down.

Unfortunately, one of the show's running gags involves the unlimited
mounds of Bolivian marching powder that fuels a group of rogue Wall
Street traders, so slowing down is just not part of the plan. It's one
snort after another, and not nearly enough of them are the laughing kind.

According to news originating from Sao Paulo, Brazil, by NewsRx

Earth's magnetic dipole over recent millennia is accompanied by the
increasing prominence of the geomagnetic South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA),
which spreads over the South Atlantic Ocean and South America. The
longevity of this feature at *millennial* timescales is elusive because
of the scarcity of continuous geomagnetic data for the region."

The 27-year-old author of Normal People is the best novelist of her
generation. James Marriott meets her in Dublin to discuss *millennial*
slurs and why the death of the novel wouldn’t be the end of the world

Talking to Sally Rooney makes you feel clever. These are some of the
topics we get through over an hour and a half: power in romantic
relationships; the ethics of free speech; the history of theology; the
economic consequences of the 2008 financial crash; Twitter memes; the
death of the novel; Brexit; Trump; Korean crime dramas; and private
education. In an interview with an American magazine she speculated on
the matter of whether frogfish are genetically related to chameleons.
“Mmm, interesting,” I interject uselessly as she lucidly analyses the
consequences of the resurgence of the far right in Europe. She’s kind
enough to make me feel as if I’m equally responsible for this conversation.

For one of the fastest-growing sectors of the global travel industry,
there is no pork on the hotel dinner menus. There are flights with no
alcohol on the drink carts, resorts with separate swimming pools for men
and women, and daily itineraries with built-in break times for the five
daily calls to prayer.

Since 2016, the number of Muslim travelers has grown nearly 30 percent,
and a recent joint study by Mastercard and Crescent
Rating[https://www.crescentrating.com/reports/mastercard-crescentrating-global-muslim-travel-index-gmti-2018.html],
a research group that tracks halal-friendly travel, projects that over
the next decade that sector’s contribution to the global economy will
jump to $300 billion from $180 billion. With a population that is
disproportionately young, educated and upwardly mobile, they are one of
the fastest-growing demographics on the global tourism scene.

It may be close to some of the state’s biggest theme parks, but Tampa
has a refreshingly cosmopolitan vibe that’s a world away from Disney

Not everyone appreciates Tampa’s hip side, or even notices it. They
might use the city as a base for nearby Busch Gardens, or as a place to
stay while exploring Orlando’s theme parks, around an hour away.

A Gillette advertisement depicting sexism in boardrooms, backyards and
on street corners is the latest in a wave of socially conscious
promotions to crop up in the wake of the Me Too era, and a message that
is likely to find a receptive audience in Canada - particularly among women.

The U.S.-based shaving company's "the best men can be" advertisement was
released this week and features scenes meant to make consumers rethink
the idea of associating masculinity with being tough or misreading
women, but has been criticized for insulting men and co-opting a social
message to sell razors.

For kids who grew up chasing the elusive thief, Carmen Sandiego was an
icon in every sense of the word-she was an impeccably dressed, fearless
world traveller, who even taught them a few things along the way. The
season one of Carmen Sandiego animated reboot is streaming on Netflix
and it is starting from today 18 January.

The animated reboot, produced by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and DHX
Media, will see the master criminal pulling off epic adventures and
evading laws with her crew. The series is based on the property which
became popular in 1985 with an educational computer game Where in the
World Is Carmen Sandiego, which also created multiple titles, an
animated series (1994-99) and a live-action kids' quiz show.

Is this the best an ad can get? If the goal is to put a mature,
high-function, low-sizzle brand front and center of the culturally
relevant news cycle on a given day, the answer seems a boisterous yes.

Earlier this week, Gillette pulled out all the stops for its foray into
woke marketing, releasing the #MeToo-inspired video that applies a
variation of its 30-year old tagline, “The best a man can get” to
counter the devastating and more insidious manifestations and fallout
from “toxic masculinity.”

skin-care line with a personalization bent — that was developed in-house
by a team of five working across Unilever’s London and Englewood Cliffs,

The stock market was trading at record highs and British fashion site
Farfetch had just whetted investors’ appetite for stocks at the
intersection of fashion and tech, garnering $8 billion valuation out of
the gate.

When Continental Office decided to open a new downtown studio in 2017,
the thinking behind its design was all about millennials. CEO Ira
Sharfin knew how challenging it was to find and retain top talent and
the new studio was conceived to give employees the flexibility to work
when and how they wanted.

A little more than a year later, the firm can say it hit a home run.

Americans are increasingly laying off the booze, prompting big brewers
and liquor companies to push beyond their traditional fare and roll out
teas, energy drinks and nonalcoholic spirits.

New data show that U.S. alcohol volumes fell 0.8% last year, steeper
than the 0.7% decline in 2017. Beer was worst hit, with volumes down
1.5% in 2018, compared with a 1.1% decline in 2017, while growth in wine
and spirits slowed, according to data compiled for The Wall Street
Journal by industry tracker IWSR.

A new book titled Buharinomics is ready to be released. The book whose
foreword was written by Reno Omokri explores and critically analyses the
leadership style and stewardship of President Muhammadu Buhari and how
he has nearly irredeemably reversed the democratic and economic gains
recorded in Nigeria since 1999.

The book written by Martins O. Itua examines President Buhari’s
electoral promises and covenant with Nigerians which he categorically
denied after winning elections by claiming that he knew nothing about
it. The book goes further to explain how President Buhari’s body
language and de-marketing of Nigeria did incalculable damage to Nigeria
at home and abroad.

Spells: 21st-Century Occult Poetry argues that poems are spells.

Is there something inherently magical about poetry? Spells: 21st-Century
Occult Poetry argues forcefully in the affirmative. Yes, there is power
in the naming of things. Yes, the rhythms and repetitions of poetry are
akin to incantations.

When is the right time to have a baby?

There’s something extra special about the holiday season when you’re a
parent, watching your kids excitedly open presents and enjoy quality
time with extended family. But, of course, that’s just half the story.
On the other side of that coin is the financial stress of having to buy
those gifts and coordinate travel to meet that extended family.

COMIC OLGA KOCH TELLS ASHLEY DAVIES WHY HER DEBUT SHOW SOUNDS LIKE A
SOVIET SPY SCANDAL

UNLESS you're a close observer of new talent on the UK comedy scene, you
might not have heard of Olga Koch. But it's likely you soon will have.
The super-smart, Russianborn 25-year-old was nominated for Best Newcomer
at the last Edinburgh Comedy Awards, and is now touring her unusual, and
very funny, debut show, Fight - about 'my family history and how it
mirrors the last 30 to 40 years of Russian history,' she says.

Indian mythology is replete with stories about the miraculous healing
properties of Ganga water, which gave cripples and lepers glimpses of
hope, if not in this life, then certainly the next. A report for the
Epidemiological Society of London noted that during the late nineteenth
century, lepers were thrown into the river in the hope that their
bodies, even in death, would be scrupulously cleaned of the contagion.

In one of the many legends surrounding the famous weaver, songwriter,
and mystic Kabir recorded in the Sikh sacred text of the Adi Granth,
Kabir’s son Kamal met a man with leprosy about to drown himself in the
River Ganga. Kamal asked him to desist from this act. He then took some
Ganga water into his palm, blew on it, and sprinkled it on the leper.
Within an instant the disease disappeared.

examining important trends in data privacy and cybersecurity during the
new year. Our previous entries were on political advertising,
cryptocurrency, emerging threats, state law trends, comparing the GDPR
with COPPA, and energy and security.

HIPAA was signed into law on August 21, 1996, over 22 years ago. As a 22
year-old, HIPAA is no longer a child, but not quite a full-fledged
adult. And, as a 22 year-old, it could be considered a part of the
*Millennial* generation. As we look to the year ahead for HIPAA, what
can its status as a *Millennial* tell us about what is to come?

Selling razor blades is a cut-throat business. In this day and age, you
need a way to stand out. Perhaps this was the thinking behind Gillette's
new advertising campaign, launched to an unwavering barrage of hostility
online.

The 90-second TV
ad[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/gillette-advert-tells-men-not-perfect-no-wonder-many-angry/]
plays on current themes of MeToo and toxic masculinity and urges men to
truly "be the best" they can be, a bid to breathe new life into
Gillette's decades-old slogan.

This week, I negotiated planes, trains and automobiles across Italy in
the noble name of men’s fashion (spare a thought, won’t you?) with two
large suitcases, two pieces of hand luggage and one shopping bag from
the spoils of a Prada discount outlet.

In the aftermath, streamlining my personal paraphernalia and adopting a
minimalist approach to bags, shoes and tailoring has become an urgent
priority.

A few millennials were left scratching their heads at a comment this
week by Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich, who said at a public
forum that he would oppose tearing down affordable housing to favor
"millennials."

After saying he wanted to preserve housing for low-income people in
Montgomery, Elrich (D) added: "So I am going to be dead-set opposed to
anybody who proposes knocking down existing affordable housing to build
housing for millennials. You know, people making sixty, $80,000."

15, 98min ****

A giddy cocktail of schadenfreude and open-mouthed horror drives this
enthralling documentary, showing on Netflix but not in cinemas, about
the infamous Fyre music festival in the Bahamas in 2017. Fyre promised
glamour and delivered chaos, and the director Chris Smith (American
Movie) weaves together a wealth of material (promotional footage, vlogs,
socialmedia posts) to anatomise a disaster. Smith also focuses on the
organiser, Billy McFarland, who styles himself as a tech entrepreneur,
but seems mostly concerned with exploiting the vulnerability of
millennials. "We're selling a pipe dream to your average loser!" he
announces as he shoots dubious promos involving bikini-clad supermodels,
including Emily Ratajkowski and Bella Hadid.

Rolex never thought that their biggest competition will be a technology
giant - Apple. Smartwatches by Cupertino, California-based company have
become the biggest threat to the legendary Swiss watchmaker. When the

forcing the businesses to be on tenterhooks, can luxury behemoths ignore

aromas of nuts, bruised apple and juniper are drawing the connoisseurs

Move over red, white or rosé. Orange wine commands the oomph factor in
the *millennial* age. Cherished for being deep amber in hue, orange wine
is neither made of oranges nor is it a mimosa cocktail or any other
concoction of sparkling wine and orange juice. It is actually a
refinement of white wine trying to lure in the hipster crowd.
