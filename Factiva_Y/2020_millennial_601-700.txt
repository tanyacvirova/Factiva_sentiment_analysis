As the fight against the novel coronavirus pandemic
[https://cnn.com/specials/asia/coronavirus-outbreak-intl-hnk]intensifies, celebrities
are using their platform to urge fans to help curb the spread of the
virus by practicing social
distancing[https://cnn.com/2020/03/15/politics/trump-administration-coronavirus-social-distancing/index.html].

On Sunday, Hollywood star-turned-politician Arnold Schwarzenegger
casually fed his pet donkey and miniature pony in his kitchen as he
asked people to consider the safety of those who, like him, are at a
higher risk from the effects of the virus.

In a scene early in "Quiz," a limited series premiering on AMC in May,
two middle-aged men sit in an empty pub, whispering in hushed tones like
spies on a covert mission.

Their eyes dart around nervously, even though it's the middle of the day
and the pub is empty.

Seyfarth Synopsis: In Rusis, et al. v. Int'l Bus. Machines Corp., No. 18
Civ. 8434, 2020 WL 1151322, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 10, 2020), the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of New York recently declined
to conditionally certify a nationwide collective action brought against
IBM on behalf of all employees over the age of 40, and in the process
cast doubt of the availability of nationwide collective actions as a
whole in this context. The Court ultimately found that the plaintiffs
had failed to demonstrate the existence of any glue that bound the
putative collective class together. The ruling is an important guidepost
for employers facing these types of lawsuit.

Earlier this week, 21-year-old Dubliner Chloe McDonnell tweeted a
request to her fellow Tinderers: "Dear boys on Tinder, I don't want to
talk about
coronavirus[https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-updates-cases-fears-deaths-us-latest-2020-03-15/].
It's not a good conversation starter or an appropriate chat-up line."
She shared one such pick-up line a guy sent her: "Have you got
coronavirus? Because I can't stop looking achoo!"

"If I want to get to know a guy that's not what I want to be talking
about," she said.

Three months after Lehman Brothers shut its doors in September 2008,
Kate McGaughey got a call from the company she worked at doing legal
research on oil-and-gas leases. She was being laid off.

With no savings after only five months in her first job after college,
she had to take on four part-time positions and sell her bicycle, laptop
and musical instruments to keep a roof over her head. She used to joke
that her liberal-arts education had gotten her a bachelor's in unemployment.

SINGAPORE - An actress in a goldfish costume shakes her head. In front
of her, on the same level, audience members are seated on chairs or a
sofa in a shophouse attic in Little India.

This is a scene from a performance of Fika & Fishy, a show that is about
a goldfish and a pet dog, yet not quite for kids, which ended its run
early this month.

As you shake off those winter doldrums, put away the snow boots and
prepare to deep clean the house, you can add a new technique: spring
cleaning your financial house.

It's so easy for us to put our financial lives on autopilot and fail to
evaluate the ways we're spending and the products we're using. So, once
a year you should set the practice of running a financial audit to
determine which products and services you no longer use or could switch
to get a better rate.

Millennials are more loyal to specific brands than any other category of
shoppers, a new survey shows, debunking the stereotype on shopping in
this age set.

With the increased usage of smartphones and internet-supported devices,
the Millennials’ needs and expectations have been a nightmare to
businesses as they seek ways of attracting customers in this demographic.

Making $54,000 a year working two jobs, 23-year-old Margaux wrote in to
*Millennial* Money to shed light on the actual struggles some
millennials are facing.

"Something I've noticed from this column is that most people have
heavily subsidized rent or help from parents, a partner, or a
significantly high income (at least enough to only work one job)," she
writes. "I don't really have much of any of this and think I'd offer a
realistic view of how money is spent for a lot of young Torontonians."

Last night on television

The makers of Belgravia (ITV) are keen to assure us that their new
Sunday night show is nothing like Downton Abbey, but writer Julian
Fellowes isn't daft. What do we find in episode one but a Dowager
Duchess demanding: "What is this newfangled tea?" It felt like a knowing
wink in our direction and also a little note of reassurance: this is a
safe space for Downton fans.

Millennials face an ethical conundrum. On the one hand, they express a
desire to travel more than previous generations. At the same time,
though, they also are more passionate about the environment.

Those two things don't always go well together.

*HD* 	Millennials & Money (A Special Report) --- When Their Money Isn't
Where Their Mouths Are: Millennials say they care about certain causes.
But they aren't investing that way.

Millennials may be more passionate about environmental and
social-justice causes than previous generations, but those values have
yet to make a significant impact on how they invest.

Part of the disconnect, according to a survey conducted in September
2019 for The Wall Street Journal by MarketCast, is that many millennials
simply aren't familiar with socially responsible investing or don't want
to commit to it until they become more financially literate.

The 11th Democratic presidential debate of the 2020 campaign, hosted by
CNN and Univision, had only two candidates, lasted two hours and often
devolved into lengthy debates about the voting records of two men who
spent decades in Congress. Here are six claims that caught our
attention. This fact check was written with my colleagues Salvador Rizzo
and Meg Kelly. Our practice is not to award Pinocchios in debate roundups.

"This was about saving the banks. And jobs. And those banks paid it
back! Bernie voted against the bailout to the automobile industry too."

Just over 10 years ago this unassuming terrain was largely made up of
marsh, farm fields, a commercial water slide, billboards and the varied
homes of several hundred people, mostly Indigenous, scattered around the
causeway to the Tsawwassen ferry terminal.

Today the land is ground zero for the world's biggest transnational

“How many world leaders, for how many decades, have seen and known what
is coming but have decided that it is more politically expedient to keep
it behind closed doors?” thundered Chlöe Swarbrick, the *millennial* MP,
on the impact of climate change, in New Zealand Parliament. “My
generation and the generations after me do not have that luxury. In
2050, I will be 56 years old. Yet, right now, the average age of this
52nd Parliament is 49 years.” She was heckled by Todd Muller, an older
MP. “OK boomer,” Swarbrick retorted, and continued with her speech.

Lady Gaga, Miley Cyrus and Taylor Swift are among the chorus of
celebrities urging fans to take coronavirus seriously as they detail
their own experiences in self-isolation.

And Younger actress and singer Hilary Duff has offered up perhaps the
most blunt coronavirus advice, telling her 14.7m followers via Instagram
Stories: “To all you young *millennial* a**holes who keep going out and
partying, GO. HOME. Stop killing old people, please.”

In times of panic and market free fall, in an era where corruption
pervades and killings persist, a spark of light and a glimpse of new
hope comes from our men and women in uniform, our police force. It is
ironically one of the last offices in government where we, the
citizenry, can expect change or pin our safety and well-being despite
its long standing motto "to serve and to protect."

In 2019, the specter of ninja cops
(https://www.bworldonline.com/ninjas[https://www.bworldonline.com/ninjas]-
in-our-midst) became the cause for fresh and untainted leadership in our
Philippine National Police (PNP). A deep restructuring was quietly
undertaken. A new unit, christened as the Integrity Monitoring and
Enforcement Group (IMEG), was activated.

ARE you looking for ways to shave your expenses? Try renting instead of
buying. The rental economy has quickly become popular online, with
Australians selling and borrowing everything from the wacky to the
practical to save and earn extra cash.

It also benefits the environment, as reusing items reduces the need for
more products to be made.

The much-loved young actress of Bollywood Alia Bhatt has turned a year
older today. The actress has taken off for a quick road trip with her
sister Shaheen Bhatt and her friends to ring in her birthday. Last

She also penned down a heartening note for her darling daughter. "Happy
Birthday my baby girl ! To me this is how you will always feel. A sweet
little baby that I need to look after and make sure your life is going
as per plan. Of course these days I am not required to look after you
much and that’s as it should be. But once a mother as they say ....

Janhvi Kapoor is undeniably the much-loved actress of the *millennial*
brigade. The starlet who rose to fame for her stint in 'Dhadak' is an
active social media user. She often keeps treating her fans with her
stunning pictures and videos on Instagram. Recently, the young actress
was captured singing the Shah Rukh Khan's popular track 'Bholi si surat'
from 'Dil To Pagal Hai'.A while ago, we stumbled upon a video wherein
Janhvi was seen happily crooning 'Bholi si surat' as she was standing on
a moving walkway at an airport. The actress looked all chirpy and
cheerful as got captured in the lenses. Check out the video: Meanwhile,
on the work front, Janhvi will be next seen in a biopic titled 'Gunjan
Saxena: The Kargil Girl', 'RoohiAfza' with co-starring Rajkummar Rao,
Karan Johar's multi-starrer period drama 'Takht' and Colin D'Cunha's
'Dostana 2' with Kartik Aaryan and Lakshya.

India, March 16 -- He's been referred to as the '*millennial* Hugh
Hefner,' perhaps because 22-year-old Padmanabh (Pacho) Singh, the
polo-playing scion of the erstwhile ruling family of Jaipur, has earned
the reputation of hosting India's most glamorous parties at his fairy
tale palace in Jaipur, to which he occasionally shows up in a stylish
velvet bathrobe, much like Hefner was known to do, at his Playboy
Mansion. Referred to as 'Jaipur Massive', the occasions are seen to have
once again galvanised the international jet set and put 'Jaipoh' back on
the glam-map, something only achieved by his great grandmother, Gayatri
Devi, who had been toasted all her life by European monarchy, Hollywood
stars and cafe society alike, thus enhancing the Pink City's mystique.

While executives and companies vested in traditional media have a spotty
record in terms of creating video programming for mobile phones, Jeffrey
Katzenberg thinks he has simple entertainment physics working in his
favor with Quibi, the streaming platform featuring short-form video
targeted to mobile devices, launching April 6.

“One thing that's happened to me in 45 years of being in Hollywood and
in this industry is, I've never seen an instance where real quality
entertainment hasn't found an audience,” Katzenberg told B+C. “Whether
we find it on the first day or 10th day or 200th day, if you make it and
it's good, they will come.”

I'm not a touchy-feely person, I hate traveling and large crowds and I
always carry hand sanitizer in my purse. So I guess I'm already pretty
prepared for the coronavirus.

When I was a kid I used to spend a fair amount of time drawing up
emergency escape routes and various disaster preparedness plans for fun.
(I was a weird 7-year-old.) But for this particular emerging issue, my
mom has taken the prep lead. She stocked up the pantry and called a
family meeting (including teleconferencing for members of the family who
are at a distance) to make sure we all had plans for what we would do if
we had to self-quarantine or if our workplaces shut down for a while.
We've all stocked up on our medications. Our family mascot (a knit Baby
Yoda doll) is in the center of the kitchen table, along with a bottle of
hand sanitizer, assisting with morale.

I t is staggering to see infants or toddlers to be precise using cell
phones in more or less in every family globally. Parents are at times
flabbergasted observing their kids using technology far better than
them. Rather, parents seek knowledge from their kids regarding the use
of information technology. Teenagers teach the use of technology to
their parents almost everywhere. One may be astonished to see how these
kids have learned and from where have they learned all this prevailing
globally. Well, it is simply the exposure and the ever-changing trends
being demonstrated by the forms of media and other technology means,
which are rapidly adopted by the youngsters. They are the inheritors of
technology. Two terms are being widely used these days when it comes to
technology: inheritors (kids), migrators (parents or the older people).
The kids of today have inherited the technology by default.

in an exclusive extract from his debut book, Style's columnist shares
his musings on modern life. Strap in

I'M SO IN LOVE WITH MY PHONE, it's like I'm having a secret affair
behind my husband's back. A tryst of constant liaisons. Flirty messages.
Mischievous pictures. Illicit typing. It's moreish, too, the thrill of
the vibrating notification in my pocket. I can feel its pulse against my
leg. I slip away to the bathroom to check my updates privately. The
gratification is instant: I am understood, I am loved, I am adored.

pride the moment her sibling rival stormed into No 10

In June 2019, it was clear that the country — the 160,000-strong Tory

Boris can stop Boris now."

Taiwanese model Ni Feiya looks like many of his contemporaries by day.
But at night, he dresses up like a woman, wears make-up and performs as
a drag queen. His "double life" defines his identity and social
interactions.

His portrait, which was taken at his house in Taiwan, is part of Chinese
photographer Luo Yang's latest series, "Youth". Although there isn't a
"behind the scenes" story to each picture, Yang says she tends to
photograph subjects who have interesting backgrounds, and whose images
exude their complex and diverse stories.

High school was a turbulent time in many people's lives. Outside of the
challenging classes preparing us for college, this was also the time we
were developing both physically and personally. As such, most of us can
recall high school as an emotional rollercoaster ride full of our first
ups and downs.

That is the thesis of Agsunta's latest release, 'Feels Trip'. The album
consists of six original songs and is produced by DNA Music. It is a
heartfelt and genuine album that perfectly captures those raging,
hormone filled emotions of our teen years.

the many ways that they create

<th>A ngela and Leen Albaka have dreamed of America since they were
little girls. Daughters of a liberal-minded couple in Damascus, they
spent their summers learning English and imagined attending college in
the United States. Angela planned to be an engineer. Leen, five years
her junior, had already fashioned herself into an American preteen,
skateboarding, playing electric guitar, speaking with a flawless accent,
and using *Millennial* slang. Then, like millions of Syrians, the civil
war turned them into refugees, and their family ended up in a cramped
apartment in Istanbul. Their next move was obvious: They went to a
United Nations office and applied for resettlement, hoping to be
selected by the U.S.

Suddenly it hit me, waking up on New Year’s Day: the 2020s is when I
become a proper grown up, turning 35 with a baby on the way. Yes, this
is the decade when millennials become middle-aged.

Ambitious millennials have so far been changing the world of work —
seeking purposeful employment, chopping and changing careers, wanting
greater flexibility for leisurely pursuits. Time out for travelling
between, even while, working. Setting up shop in record numbers.

is an animal print jacket that he recently leased at Recloset, a Chilean

garments for the day to day.The business is new in the country, but less

Art is a reflection of his time. It reveals the interests and concerns
of society, the time in which it is lived and its problems. In the same
way, the art market has shown itself to be sensitive to its economic
environment and proof of this is that trends that modify it begin to
emerge. In it, women and millennials continue to gain relevance and are
already starting to change it.

As for the global economy, 2019 was a difficult year in the art market.
Global sales fell 5 percent to $64.1 billion, returning to 2017 levels,
with falls in the three major markets: the United States, the United
Kingdom, and China, totaling 82 percent of the value of the industry's
total sales, according to the The Art Market 2020 by Art Basel and UBS.

TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - The ‘M’ in M Bloc stands for many things; Music,
Meals, and Movies, amongst others, communicate the excitement in M Bloc
Space. As a house of vibrant gigs and creative culture, M Bloc stands
out in its facade. Upon entering the premises, visitors will be greeted
by the eye-catching broadway sign adorning the lobby and a cluster of
jubilant groups of friends clearly excited in their disposition to be at
M Bloc.

Chatter and laughter fill the space at M Bloc. As millennials would
enjoy their daily afternoon sweet iced coffee along with a healthy dose
of the setting sun, vibrance is a quality M Bloc has in abundance. When
night comes, these groups of millennials would usually then shuffle
their way to the Live House, to enjoy the night’s entertainment.

New Delhi, March 15 -- Ashwin Suresh's career was on a trajectory many
Indian families aspire to-an MS in engineering from the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign followed by an investment banking job with
Citi in New York. "I was living the Wall Street life and the markets
were doing really well-in the beginning," recalls Suresh. Then came the
crash of 2008.

Unlike many others, he kept his job. But there wasn't much work and he
started attending evening classes to rekindle a side project from his
college days: film study. He earned a diploma in film-making from the
New York Film Academy. "In the process, I discovered that to me it was
much more exciting as a career than finance."

September 2019, M Bloc remains steadfast in their no-parking and
cashless policies. Aided with their vintage fifties aesthetic, M Bloc
encapsulates the modern *millennial* playground.

Aside from their authentic values, music is a huge part of M Bloc’s
‘soul’ because music in M Bloc, undoubtedly takes center stage. The
broadway sign at the lobby illuminates with the musical acts set to
perform throughout the month. With the live house purposefully built as
the pinnacle of a visitor’s journey, M Bloc pays homage to Blok M’s long
and illustrious history with the Jakarta music scene.

Estate appraiser Julie Hall advises downsizing clients not to take it
personally when their adult kids don’t want their furniture and other
possessions. But when Hall asked her 23-year-old daughter what she might
want from the four-bedroom family home, the younger woman mentioned just
three items.

“And I said, ‘Out of this whole house? Honey, we have nice things!’”
says Hall, author of several books, including “How to Clean Out Your
Parents’ Estate in 30 Days or Less.” “I started to sound like my clients.”

There were no protesters or picketers. Just roughly 1,800 people -
couples on date nights, clusters of young men, boomer parents with their
*millennial* kids - lined up on a downtown Washington, D.C., block,
eager to watch Louis C.K. tell jokes.

Inside the Warner Theatre last Sunday, some in the sold-out crowd
chanted his name, as if to summon him, and they stood on their feet when
C.K. materialized. "I love you, Louie!" shouted a guy, who at 8:30 p.m.
already had too much to drink.

India, March 15 -- Alia Bhatt is one of the best actors that Bollywood
has seen lately, the actor is a complete chameleon and blends into any
role that she portrays. From the bratty, sheltered Shanaya with her
enviable designer wardrobe (along with a song and dance about said
brands) in her debut Student of the Year to the simple, feisty gully
girl Safeena in her jeans, kurti and headscarf in Gully Boy, the
*millennial* can pull anything off with equal finesse. The Kalank actor
turns 27 today, and she rang in her birthday on Sunday along with sister
Shaheen Bhatt and best friend Akanksha Ranjan Kapoor.

Instagram-inspired enthusiasts are making their interior-design dreams
real -- only 12 times smaller.

The kitchen that Jessica Coffee designed checked all the trendy boxes:
white Shaker cabinets, a subway-tile backsplash, wide oak-plank floors
and an open-concept floor plan, with views into the living room's
shiplap walls. The photographs she posted on her Instagram page evoked
enthusiastic comments from followers, who gushed about high-end details
like the water filler above the stove.

There was a time, not so long ago, when a respectable high-school
graduation opened doors to a career of some kind. That has allchanged.
In fact, a university degree or college qualifications no longer
guarantee anything.

According to a recent CBC News report, recent university or college
graduates are finding a post-secondary education is not an automatic
promise of stable employment.

As I write this, it's been eight days since I last stepped into the
office. Like thousands of other workers in California, I've been doing
my job (and staying put) at home to avoid spreading or catching
covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.

This isn't my first outbreak: Seventeen years ago, I self-quarantined in
my Hong Kong apartment for three weeks to avoid the epidemic of severe
acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS.

President Nayib Bukele on Saturday issued a harsh warning to the rest of
the world's leaders about the COVID-19 pandemic, which he called for
"extreme" action in the coming hours.

As usual, the president of El Salvador appealed to his Twitter account
to post a message thread with his diagnosis about what might happen with
the expansion of the coronavirus in case it is not acted on time.
However, the small Central American country has no confirmed cases,
although the government was one of the first to close the borders and
decree the red alert.

India, March 15 -- Alia Bhatt is the greatest actress working in Hindi
films today, and she doesn't even know it. She might even be among the
greatest contemporary actors in Hindi cinema, period, regardless of
gender, but imagine telling her that.

The thing about Alia, who turns 27 on March 15, is that she's perhaps
the most naturally gifted performer we have right now. Unlike the scores
of her contemporaries, who can't help but remind everyone of that
three-month residency they did at the Lee Strasberg institute, Alia
needs neither education nor pretentious anecdotes to prove her
credentials. Her powers are formidable, and luckily for both her and her
audience, unlikely to ever diminish.

“I’m so sorry, if I could get in the kitchen and cook it myself, I
would,” says our penitent waitress as the wait for our meals ticks over
to the hour mark.

We’re at Andonis Cafe and Bar at Yeerongpilly, in Brisbane’s south-west,
and despite its unlikely position in an industrial estate opposite a
gym, the place is more chockers than an Ikea flatpack.

India, March 15 -- I have to say, he was not impressed, initially," says
Padma Vibhushan, Hariprasad Chaurasia, reminiscing about the time when
he landed a job at All India Radio in Cuttack. The 'he' here, is his
father, a strict disciplinarian, who wanted his son to become a pehelwan
(wrestler). The legendary flautist, once, used to sit on the sidelines
of an akhada waiting for his turn. His mind, however, wandered somewhere
else. "When I reached Cuttack and started working, only then did he
breathe a sigh of relief," he says, laughing.

Bernie Sanders seems certain to fail in his second attempt to win the
Democratic nomination. But his followers are here to stay. By Ed Luce

Just over a century ago, American socialism hit its high-water mark.
Some might consider that combination of words "American socialism" to be
an oxymoron. But the US allergy to socialism can be exaggerated. In the
local elections of 1917, the Socialist Party of America took a third of
the council seats in Chicago, a quarter in New York and large chunks
across the industrial Midwest. Millions subscribed to socialistnewspapers.

Although the new cool leafy colour might seem like a modern colour
option, it's easily incorporated into traditional décor schemes,too.
Here are a few ways to useit. For a more casual, country look, add the
new green with warmer neutral colours like caramel, rust orbrown.

If painting your walls green, keep trims white orwood.

Society The family structure we've held up as the cultural ideal for the
past half century has been a catastrophe for many. It's time to figure
out better ways to live together, writes David Brooks.

It's the story of our times: the family, once a dense cluster of many
siblings and extended kin, has fragmented into smaller and more fragile
forms. The initial result of that fragmentation, the nuclear family,
didn't seem so bad. But then, because the nuclear family is so brittle,
the fragmentation continued.

to be. There’s what we might term a solo sex scene in the first 10
minutes, with Gemma (Thalissa Teixeira) watching porn while waiting for
boyfriend Kieran (Gary Carr) to get home. They get a new lodger who
turns out to be attractive in a cool French way, and as this has been
billed as a controversial drama about polyamory, well, they’re going to
be at it like *millennial* rabbits before the episode is out, right?

But what we got was something unexpected: a quite lovely study of
relationships and all the messiness that real life entails, disarming in
its moments of sweetness. There was one lyrical scene, in which the
camera tracked Gemma and Kieran as they walked through the flat, that
played out like a piece of modern dance.

Remember the old joke about the American general giving evidence to a

Blue might be the colour of the year in 2020, but green remains a
perennial decorating favourite. Green, in all its glorious variations,
is one of the mostseen colours in nature and that makes it easier to
work with when decorating. Just look to the natural world for
inspiration on the many shades of green and how to use them in your
decor. In the desert, for instance, greens tend to be cooler grey-based;
in lush, tropical climates, green has a warmer, yellow base. This year,
the tone of green that's popular is a cooler, greyer green, best
described as olive or aloe green. Whether decorating with this popular
colour as an overall or as an accent, it's easy to go green with this
colour trend by following my "sage" advice.

Pamela CarranzaAt the beginning of the month it was learned that Bad
Bunny had managed to outperform The Catalan Rosalía when it came to
Spotify views. The "Bad Rabbit" album broke a record on Spotify Spain.
"YHLQMDLG" thus achieved more than 5.3 million reproductions and stole
prominence from the reign of "The Evil Wants" of Rosalía."YHLQMDLG",
that is, ("I Do What Gives Me The Win"), became his long-awaited second
album, without imagining that it was going to sweep into the industry.
Even the multiple censorship has not managed to stop the success of the
trapero that was 26 years old on Tuesday.For many in the trap, reggaeton
or perreo, this young *millennial* is the boss.

Greek-born bilingual poet, novelist, and teacher Stratis Haviaras passed
away on March 3 at the age of 85. In honor of this gifted writer, The
National Herald takes a look back at his life and work.

Haviaras’ parents were refugees from Asia Minor who settled in Nea Kios,
Argos, near Nafplio in the Peloponnese, when it was founded in 1927. As
a child, Haviaras lived through the horrors of World War II. When he was
9 years old, the Nazis executed his father, Christos, for his
participation in the resistance, and his mother, Georgia Hatzikyriakos,
was sent to a concentration camp in Germany. Subsequently, the family
home was demolished by the occupying forces.

Entrepreneur Brittny Robins is scaling up her simplified approach to
cosmetics through a partnership with the country's oldest department
store. As Caitlin Agnew writes, she's part of a group of Canadian women
disrupting the self-care industry for the better

Traditionally, beauty companies often take a prescriptive approach to
product development and marketing, telling their customers how they
should look. But that's a formula that *millennial* cosmetic
entrepreneurs and customers alike have flipped on its head, creating the
expectation that beauty brands should listen to consumers and offer them
what they want.

My parents knew the true value of thrift. That's why I'm not cheering
the £1trillion...

BRITAIN is borrowing again. Big time. Remember the old joke about the
American general giving evidence to a congressional committee about
spending on armaments? 'You spend a million here ... a million there ...
pretty soon you're talking real money.' It was funny then because a
million really was a lot of money (I said it was an old joke) but then
it changed. And the million was replaced with a billion. And now that's
been replaced, too. We're talking trillions now.

Urban *millennial* Marianna Hunt ditches her cards and discovers
first-hand the cost of surviving on notes and coins

Britain's high streets are fast turning into cash deserts, as bank
branches close their doors and switch off hole-inthe-wall machines.
Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor, was due to announce a solution to the cash
crisis in the Budget. However, as coronavirus took centre stage, access
to cash was reduced to a vague pledge that the Government would
introduce laws to "meet the changing needs of cash users".

She told the *Millennial* Love podcast: "The threshold of bulls**t has
always been way more than I would put up with now. One of my exes was
texting people in a way that wasn't fair and I kept forgiving that
because of what they would say to change my mind. And I think that's why
a lot of my songs are quite angry and savage, because I finally binned

Richard Spencer discovers the dark arts that propelled Prince Mohammed
bin Salman towards the Saudi throne Book of the week

MBS The Rise to Power of Mohammed bin Salman by Ben Hubbard William
Collins, 384pp; £20 Two acts of brilliant opportunism have shaped the
Trump administration's relationship with Saudi Arabia, but they were not
the work of Donald Trump. The first took place in the hours after King
Abdullah of Saudi Arabia died at the age of 90 in January 2015. While
his ageing brothers gathered to pay respects, clasping each others'
hands, a young nephew was gathering a different crowd of advisers.
Prince Mohammed bin Salman known as MBS is in some ways a creature of
his tribe, the Al Saud. He is no less mercurial and is prone to
disappearing from view for long periods as he indulges his favoured
pursuits, in his case videogaming and sailing on his giant yacht. But he
knows how to grasp a bull by the horns.

The trend of nurturing succulents is gaining popularity, thanks to their
easy-tohandle nature. And green décor enthusiasts, especially
millennials, are pursuing it as a hobby

Surabhi Kamat was in a fix; having worked late over the week to complete
a project, she had to put in time on the weekend too and had barely
spent time at home. An avid gardener, Kamat's house was a green room.
But an increasingly hectic work schedule meant less time to tend to her
garden. That's when succulents caught her fancy."When on holiday in
Malaysia, I fell in love with the succulents at a nursery and bought a
few all the way back to India. Since then, it has been an art project of
sorts, and an alternative to satisfy my green thumb itch without having
to worry about neglecting them," says the 27-year-old PR professional
who sports several terrariums as décor pieces to brighten up her home.

Developer, policy advisor and industry leader, Dr Niranjan Hiranandani
has been serving the Indian real estate in various capacities for over
four decades. As co-founder and MD, Hiranandani Group, and national
president of two key industry associations-NAREDCO and ASSOCHAM, he has
seen the industry transform from nascent stages to its current
tech-driven, buyer-centric avatar. On the occasion of his 70birthday, he
sheds light on what it will take to usher in the next phase of growthThe
one thing that has not changed is the demand for industry status - we
are regulated but not yet given the status. Ease of doing business has
improved because a proactive government is coming up with new policies,
and these are certainly some of the positive changes. The Indian economy
has made a paradigm shift over the decades, and this is reflected in
real estate.
