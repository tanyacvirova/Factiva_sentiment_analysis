*HD* 	The Big Number: Millennials to overtake boomers in 2019 as largest
U.S. population group

Sometime this year, the *millennial* generation — those born from 1981
to 1996 — will overtake baby boomers as the largest adult population
group in the United States, according to government data analyzed by the
Pew Research Center. The number of millennials is projected to reach
73 million, aided in part by immigration, while the boomer population,
born from 1946 to 1964, is expected to decline to 72 million this year
as members die off. Boomers (the only generation officially given a name
by the Census Bureau) peaked in size at nearly 79 million in 1999.

The aging of such a large group will continue to put pressure on the
U.S. health-care system and Medicare costs. According to the Census
Bureau, by 2030, when "all baby boomers will be older than age 65," 1 in
5 U.S. residents will be of retirement age. Gen Xers — a smaller group
sandwiched between millennials and boomers and now mostly in middle age
— will finally outnumber boomers in 2028.

At a time when the average person compulsively records, shares, and
archives images and video of the mundane trivialities they experience in
their day-to-day lives, it can be hard — emotionally, if not
intellectually — to accept that most of our species’ defining moments
have been lost like tears in the rain. The world has access to more
footage of an adorable panda being startled by a sneeze than it does of
the entire Roman Empire, and that’s just the way things are.

Before there was Communitech, or the glass-clad Google building, or the
tall condo towers that signified an economic renaissance in downtown
Kitchener, Cory Bluhm was thinking about David Foot's 1996 book, "Boom,
Bust & Echo."

The book predicted how the children of baby boomers - their "echo" -
would become a force to be reckoned with. They would become a population
bulge almost as significant as their parents

Less than a year after launching its first campaign from then-new agency
partner Havas, Carl’s Jr. has again placed its creative advertising
business in review.

A spokesperson for parent company CKE, which owns Carl’s Jr. and sister
brand Hardee’s in addition to the Green Burrito and Red Burrito
restaurants, positioned the review as an attempt to establish more
distinct identities for the two burger chains.

With a wellness-themed lineup of matcha, rose, turmeric and
charcoal-flavored beverages, Instagram star and *millennial* cult
favorite Dirty Lemon has sold more than 2 million bottles in three years
and snagged upwards of 100,000 customers, with 90 percent of its orders
processed via text message.

It’s little wonder that the startup refers to itself as a tech company,
especially with its latest endeavor: The Drug Store, a cashierless
retail concept that functions like a walk-in vending machine. For VIPs,
there’s a SoHo House-style experience attached, with special events,
custom cocktails, product sampling and film screenings. The permanent
brick-and-mobile venue in New York’s Tribeca neighborhood, opened last
fall, is just the beginning, said Zak Normandin, Dirty Lemon’s founder
and CEO. Next: A second store in Manhattan, at Hudson Yards, along with
Los Angeles and Miami locations.

It’s over. After 12 years of daily contact, I am finished with Facebook.
It's not easy. We had a long meaningful connection — my avatar had more
than 1200 virtual friends from every stage of my life.

Thousands of tiny takes and status updates from two-dimensional
acquaintances had nearly replaced physical, personal contact. And those
digital updates, links and images carried surprising emotional value.
For instance, though my mother died four years ago at 90, I’ve still
wished her happy birthday each year on her dormant Facebook page.

India, Jan. 25 -- The apple hasn't fallen too far from the tree. Indians
pretty much put on the plate what earlier generations did but in
different quantities and combinations. We still eat with the memories of
our past, a time when there was no conception that food essentials -
flour, sugars, salt and water - could be processed and would come out of
a packet.

Growing up in Delhi in the '40s, food writer Madhur Jaffrey in her book
Climbing the Mango Trees, recalls tables laid out in utter fearlessness
and abandon at her home: breakfasts of three kinds of eggs and bacon;
lunches of deep-fried phulkas and bitter gourd stuffed with fennel - all
made fresh in the home kitchen. Dinners of 'English food' (soup and
toast) and 'Indian food' (rogan josh, meatball curry and chapatis with
dollops of ghee). This was a world still innocent of the power of
margarine on the table as food and as idea.

Let’s be honest, a documentary showing the distress of thousands of

be the feelgood movie of the year.

With the data Statistics Canada has access to these days, it must be
like porn for geeks. For instance, a new StatCan study links people's
census data with their federal tax files to figure out how well or badly
recent generations of Canadian labour-market participants have done
according to their level of education. No more asking people what their
income was last year. You link right to their tax form to find out down
to the last penny (or nickel, since we don't have pennies anymore).

We asked several experts to consider how the future of aviation might be
shaped by huge forces transforming the world today

We know what has already happened, say, in the past decade – or at least
we think we do. What’s coming in the future – the next decade, for
example – we obviously can’t know. But to make best guesses is human
nature, not to mention the underpinnings of corporate management and the
consultancy industry. How we make those best guesses, though, is fraught
with uncertainty. Armed with data and experience of the past, we tend to
extrapolate and typically describe a future that – comfortingly – is
very much like the past.

The Weather Channel is a locomotive in Entertainment Studios’ portfolio
of businesses generating sizable cash-flow profit, enlarging entrée to
advertisers because of its heft and, in what is often unappreciated by
outsiders, serving as a media-technology engine.

To keep the Weather Channel cable network relevant in an era when
information is readily available online and via personal devices, the
linear basic cable network jazzes up its presentation with flashy media
tech. Weather Channel serves up immersive mixed reality and augmented
reality — layering digital images into real-world presentations as in
in-studio weather telecasts.

For black millennials, there are arguably no five words more defining of
our generation than these, from Notorious B.I.G's 1994 hit "Juicy": "It
was all a dream." Biggie's rhymes promised black kids and teens of the
'90s that one day, we'd be able to give a collective middle finger to
the naysayers — the teachers, the police, the politicians — who told us
that our dreams should be limited.

"Juicy" told a tale of black upward mobility — "Don't let 'em hold you
down/Reach for the stars" — and we relished its optimism. That our own
success and happiness would exceed those of our parents seemed a
foregone conclusion. But while hip-hop did, as Biggie predicted, "take
it this far" — becoming the most consumed musical genre in the nation —
the black millennials who were its most loyal fans have encountered a
much tougher road.

2019 FEB 2 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at
Marketing Weekly News -- Valassis, a leader in activating consumers
through intelligent media delivery, released new research financial
institutions can utilize to attract and maintain satisfied customers.
With today's dynamic consumers having access to in-person, online and
mobile app banking options, marketing campaigns centered on what banking
customers value is more important than ever.

Based on data from more than 1,700 respondents, Valassis found that 30
percent of consumers don't feel much loyalty to their bank and can be
readily influenced to switch. In fact, nearly 10 percent of consumers
plan to switch in the next year, with this number nearly doubling among
millennials at 19 percent, and even higher for *millennial* parents,
with 26 percent planning to switch banks in the next year. This presents
a prime opportunity for banks to attract these on-the-fence customers
and inspire loyalty.

2019 FEB 1 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Science
Letter -- Investigators publish new report on Science - Quaternary
Science. According to news reporting originating from Minneapolis,
Minnesota, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, "We review the
current generation of large-scale, *millennial*-length temperature
reconstructions derived from tree rings and highlight areas of agreement
and disagreement among these state-of-the-art paleotemperature
estimates. Although thousands of tree ring-width chronologies are now
available from temperate and boreal forest sites across the Northern
Hemisphere, only a small fraction of those records are suited as proxies
for surface temperature."

Italy, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, "In the DEEP core from
the Lake Ohrid ICDP drilling project, the carbon isotope composition of
bulk organic matter (delta C-13(TOC)) over the last 516 ka shows a
negative correlation with total organic carbon (TOC) and total inorganic
carbon (TIC). This relationship is marked by periods of lower delta
C-13(TOC) values corresponding to higher TIC and TOC."

Financial supporters for this research include Deutsche
Forschungsgemeinschaft, Universitat zu Koln, British Geological Survey,
Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Consiglio Nazionale
delle Ricerche, ICDP, German Ministry of Higher Education and Research,
FYROM.

2019 FEB 2 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at
Investment Weekly News -- Eave, Inc., a digital mortgage startup,
announced findings from its Homebuyer Sentiments Survey, revealing
Americans' biggest barriers to homeownership and what they are willing
to sacrifice to make buying a home possible. In tandem, Eave also
announced and expansion of its mortgage suite, to financing for home
values beginning at $32,000 and up to $20 million for California and
Colorado homebuyers.

Conducted by Atomik Research, the findings confirm Americans are still
in a dark place when it comes to home buying and financing. Despite a
decade having passed since the housing market crash, neither time nor
new service offerings have made a difference. More than a quarter (26
percent) of respondents don't trust big banks since the housing crash of
2008, and close to a third (32 percent) say they have no familiarity at
all of the available mortgage lending options.

French TV. It's sort of a catch-all term for anglophone Canadians for
the channels they skip over when they're deciding what to watch on
cable. Many because they just don't understand the language, or at least
have trouble following conversations in it, or don't get its cultural
references. Others have preconceived notions that television produced
for the local Quebec market is of poor quality compared to the
critically acclaimed dramas coming out of the United States.

Quebec TV series won't ever have the budgets of U.S. network dramas or
bigger cable shows, but as the quality of television has improved
internationally, so too have homegrown series, with more gripping
writing, more spectacular cinematography, more realistic acting and more
breathtaking direction.

When consumers get the sniffles, they have many questions besides
whether it’s a cold or allergies, and whether they should take time off
work. More and more, people also want to know which over-the-counter
products are available, what they contain and which symptoms the
medicines can relieve. If a child is sick, consumers worry about the
correct dosage to administer, and whether the products are safe.

The Consumer Healthcare Products Association, citing Nielsen numbers,
reported that U.S. consumers spent more than $34.3 billion on OTC
medicines at retail in 2017, up from $33.6 billion in 2016. Cough-cold
products are a large category, as people spent more than $8.6 billion on
upper respiratory products in 2017. Also, people spent more than $4.1
billion on OTC internal analgesics, or pain relief products, in 2017.

LONDON — Beige may not be a shade that gets hearts thumping, but
Riccardo Tisci has embraced it with gusto, using it as inspiration for
his first ad campaign for Burberry, a multigenerational, multicultural
collaboration.

The campaign, which broke Thursday on the brand’s social media outlets,
channels the same quiet confidence and refinement of Tisci’s spring
collection for the British label. Photographed in places including
London and Spain, images range from the cinematic to the painterly, with
touches of chiaroscuro and dramatic backdrops.

Tired of being stuck in traffic, driving on congested and unsafe roads,
and incessant pollution, millennials are increasingly opting for smarter
vehicles and transportation frameworks.

If there is one word that defines the post-2000 generations, it would
have to be "smart". From smartphones to almost every other device and
its "smarter" variant, the word has come to define products, services,
and ideas that have reached a certain level of perfection in terms of
utility, design and performance. The *millennial* generation prefers
everything that is quick, cost-effective, and sustainable over the long
term. That is why the adjective "smart" is spilling over from describing
hi-tech gadgets to summarising the transformation happening in
conventional domains such as transportation.

Mumbai: Hindustani Classical Music is an integral part of our culture
and been preserved for years together. In this *millennial* age, we
discover the underground culture of Hindustani hip-hop and we can't
thank Zoya Akhtar director Gully Boy starring Ranveer Singh and Alia
Bhatt for making this culture mainstream.

The film-makers, actors launched the Jukebox yesterday with much pomp
and much expected craziness. A fluorescent attired Ranveer Singh took
the audience on a trip like never before with rapping, who was soon
joined on stage with young rapping talents of India. The audience went
into frenzy when Ranveer started singing Apna Time Ayega live on stage.

A radio fan recalls the vintage years in a Bill Bryson-style informal
history, says Clive Davis

The title of Charlie Connelly’s book evokes an era when everyone knew
that the word “wireless” referred to the hefty Bakelite box on the
sideboard. In the days when radios had valves and the names of stations
etched on the tuning dial, Hilversum was one of the exotic places that
could arouse wistful thoughts in the minds of many a listener.

DOOMSDAY preachers who loudly touted the January Blood Moon a harbinger
of the apocalypse have been proven wrong, according to a biblical
prophecy expert.

The Blood Moon eclipse peaked in the morning hours of Monday, January
21, here in the UK. For a period of 62 minutes starting just before 5am
GMT, the Full Moon turned an ominous red colour in the Earth’s shadow.
Some Christian conspiracy theorists saw this as a prophetic fulfilment
of biblical prophecy. The Blood Moon was dubbed a “harbinger of the
Apocalypse”, a “prophetic sign for America” and “evidence of Jesus
Christ’s Second Coming”.

Colorado-based subsidiary, Great-West Life & Annuity Insurance Company
(GWL&A), has struck a deal to unload its individual life insurance and
annuity business to Protective Life Insurance Company, the primary
subsidiary of Protective Life Corporation. The deal is subject to
regulatory approval.

Jeanene Jobst, senior counsel at Turner Broadcasting in Atlanta, was at
work when a phone call sent her into a panic.

The babysitter who was scheduled to pick up her young daughter at her
school bus stop was canceling at the last minute. With just 10 minutes
until drop-off, it was physically impossible for Jobst to get there in
time to ensure her 7-year-old, Madison, wasn't left on the side of the
road—alone.

As Senator Kamala Harris becomes the latest to declare a run for the
presidency, Democrats are heading for a primary of 'the women and the
woke'. Philip Delves Broughton sizes up the candidates vying for the top job

TWO years after Hillary Clinton fell short in her bid to become
America's first woman president, four of the seven declared candidates
for the Democratic presidential nomination of 2020 are now women, all
confident that Donald Trump is there for the taking.

INSTAGRAM is the QVC for the *millennial* generation, someone wise once
observed. And my, it has become a shopping channel. No wonder the
Competitions and Markets Authority has demanded that influencers now
declare their influence by putting #sponsored tags on the end of their
posts, or face a fine or even prison.

Rita Ora, Ellie Goulding and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, right, are among
those who've been named by the CMA as committing to hashtagging their
posts that extol freebies. Instagram influencers can earn tens of
thousands for a promotion, and indeed the #sponsored tag is now having
an unusual effect: influencers who aren't even paid are now attaching it
to their posts to make it look like they might be worth the money.

In an office on the 19th floor of One M&T Plaza in Buffalo, René Jones
keeps a collection of photographs on a side table. There’s a picture of
his father in a military uniform. There are images of his daughters as
they’ve grown over the years. And there’s a photo of his longtime
mentor, the late Robert Wilmers, leading his very first annual
shareholders meeting.

Jones, 54, was appointed chairman and CEO of Buffalo-based M&T Bank
shortly after Wilmers’ death on Dec. 16, 2017. He has one of those
enviable cityscape views that come with having an office in one of
Buffalo’s tallest buildings. His office looks out at the East Side, a
maze of streets and buildings and landmarks that stretch far into the
distance. On his desk there’s a small magnifying glass and, like his
predecessor, a handful of sharpened pencils, sitting neatly in a row.

The transformation taking place in manufacturing is undeniable. From the
biggest global manufacturers to the smallest specialty parts-makers, the
way products are designed and built is morphing as digitization
continues to bring a dizzying array of new technologies to factory floors.

As companies integrate tools ranging from robots, internet-connected
sensors and wearable tech to mobile devices and real-time data analytics
into their work environments, the roles human workers play are also
evolving.

Republic Day marks the day when the Constitution of India came into
effect. So as India gears up to celebrate the 70th Republic Day on
January 26, brands get creative and roll out campaigns that champion
social causes, patriotism and could well tug even at the most cynical
heartstrings. From Videocon to ixigo, these ad campaigns capture the
essence of patriotism, pride and the day's historic significance just right.

Whenyou walk past a Patisserie Valerie don’t your eyes devour the
strawberry tarts? An indulgence too far? No more than the sugar-coated
creativity of the accounting at the company which, now discovered, has
led Luke Johnson’s chain to collapse into administration and a third of
its shops closing. And with it goes a little slice of European culture
in our midst.

We Brits think our own cream buns as something on a saucy Brighton
postcard — “naughty but nice”. It was the European patissier who turned
them into an art form. The glistening apples, sponges, mountains of
buttercream and whipped cream were an expression of civilised cafés and
the lilt of Strauss, of opera houses and stately parties.

Why Diane is a big deal: Now in its 50th year, Hispanic- and woman-owned
Arroyo Process Equipment distributes and services industrial supplies
such as pumps, mixers and other equipment used in manufacturing. The
Tampa company has locations in Bartow, Jacksonville, Miami and the
Dominican Republic and has long represented industrial manufacturers
throughout North America. Diane’s father, Cuban immigrant Frank Arroyo
Sr., started the company in 1968. She joined the family business at 21
answering phones and was soon helping to automate computer systems. She
ran a machine shop at 25, and endured a lot of challenges. It hasn’t
always been easy to work with her dad. It took him time to gain
confidence in her, and in 2004, their issues were so acute, she left the
business for a short time. When it began to falter, she and her dad
worked out their differences and she returned. Eight years later, he had
a stroke, and her role as CEO evolved and she has built the business since.

Walmart is tackling a problem that extends not just across the food,
drug and mass retail arena but also other industry sectors: not enough
truck drivers.

The retail giant said yesterday that it plans to hire “hundreds more”
truck drivers to its fleet this year after adding over 1,400 in 2018, a
gain of about 500 from the previous year. To that end, the company has
launched new onboarding events that include assessments, mentorships and
speedier hiring.

As she prepares to hand her job over to a robot, DW's Kate Ferguson
makes the case for reforming Germany's social security system to better
suit the new recruit.

In Germany, the chances of your job being taken by a robot are higher
than in other advanced economies. Researchers attribute this to the
dominance of industries like car manufacturing and mechanical
engineering, which don't require much of a human touch.

India, Jan. 25 -- High-pitched animated voices, laughter and chattering
keep emanating from the first-floor home of the Rodrigues family thereby
providing a lively and boyish aura to the building and immediate
neighbourhood. Being Republic Day, Dominic Rodrigues, an energetic
14-year old student at one of Mumbai's well known schools has invited
his friends to come and spend the day-long holiday at his home playing
videogames.

Dominic is passionate about videogames since it brings him immense joy.
Hence, when his parents were considering purchase of a new television -
they took Dominic's suggestions and purchased a television with special
suitability for playing video games. The parents might put time bound
restrictions and conditions on Dominic as to the quantum of time spent
playing videogames but they still consider his inputs while taking
purchase decisions.

This article contains spoilers for the Netflix series ''You.''

Netflix's first hit new show of 2019 isn't new at all: The first season
of ''You,'' a witty thriller that problematizes both social media and
our affection for a man who will do anything to get the girl, began on
Lifetime last September. But despite turning up on critics' year-end Top
10 lists, the show made minimal impact on a packed TV landscape.

To borrow an idiom from the extremely online, late Godard is a mood.
Inscrutable, stubborn and pessimistic; preoccupied with historical
traumas, dead writers and old movies; and yet, in spite of what looks
like nostalgia and sounds like fatigue, unmistakably -- defiantly --
present, alive and engaged.

That said, I don't think I'm alone among Jean-Luc Godard completists in
finding that my admiration (or tolerance) for a given film depends a lot
on my own mood at the time of viewing. For the past 20 years or so, the
movies themselves have been consistent in their themes, attitudes and
rhythms, but sometimes I'm unable to shake myself out of my sunny,
shallow, American mental habits and succumb to the master's gloomy
Gallic wit and intellectual intransigence.

PARIS -- A new couture collection was not the only unveiling
masterminded by Giorgio Armani this week. On Friday, the Italian fashion
designer -- who was on the 2018 Forbes list of the world's billionaires
-- was scheduled to announce plans to redevelop his Giorgio Armani
boutique at 760 Madison Avenue in New York City, creating not just a new
flagship but, above it, the interiors for 19 new luxury apartments.

It will give fresh meaning to the phrase ''living above the shop.''

Amazon's first original scripted comedy series from India — Four More
Shots Please!, out now on Prime Video globally — is about the lives of
as many *millennial* women as there are tequila drinks in the title. To
some, that might feel reminiscent of Lena Dunham's comedy-drama Girls,
though most of the leads here tilt towards the latter half of their
twenties and early thirties, with the age differences spanning nearly a
decade between the quartet. Four More Shots Please! is also a lot more
glamorous — all of them live in Mumbai's posh southern district, as
opposed to the gritty Brooklyn, New York of Dunham's show — which makes
it more akin to Girls' spiritual predecessor, Sex and the City.
Naturally, its closest homegrown equivalent is last year's Veere Di
Wedding, which also centred on four glamorous women.

Backstreet's back, as the Boys release DNA, their ninth album and first

JOE JACKSON — FOOL Jackson is a singer and composer whose output has
never followed a conventional course. At first he was lumped into the
New Wave — along with Elvis Costello but, as with the latter, he was
always more. Too lyrically observational and musically adventurous for
the mainstream, he's continued to go his own way.

I have a fairly stable relationship. She is wearing a seven with me, she

It is all too easy to be cynical about the Oscars, to argue that the big

reaction to his nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his turn in Can

Features | A strange form of nostalgia has taken over pop music, as
artists from The 1975 to Charli XCX reminisce about times they were too
young to have lived through. By Ed Power

The latest sell-out tour by pop extroverts The 1975 is so retro that
it's a surprise concertgoers aren't handed complimentary Rubik's Cubes
on their way in. The state-of-the-art set is bathed in a fuzzy lava lamp
glow that by turns recalls the opening credits of Rainbow and U2's Zoo
TV tour.

You're in the company of the vast majority of Americans if you do not
know who Pete Buttigieg is. He is the mayor of South Bend, Ind., and he
announced on Wednesday that he is forming a presidential exploratory
committee. The Post reports, "The *millennial* profile is only one of
the attributes Buttigieg brings to the race: He is a former Rhodes
scholar and Afghanistan veteran, a native Midwesterner who is gay. (He
and his husband, Chasten Glezman, were married last summer.)" So yes, we
have another first in the 2020 field — the first openly gay man with a
spouse. (That his sexual orientation drew so little notice speaks well
of a country that has gotten past fighting over gay marriage.)

His introductory video was appealing if not earthshaking:

Mumbai, Jan. 25 -- With two out of three Indians under 30 years, venture
capital funds are increasingly turning to startups that are tapping the
large population of *millennial* consumers, multiple investors said. A
recent report by private equity firm KKR said the Asian *millennial* is
expected to reshape the global consumer market, since the continent has
more than six times as many millennials as in the US and Europe
combined. This will have far-ranging implications in healthcare,
wellness, leisure, financial services and entertainment, the report
said. "We are interested in businesses that target customers who have
shown a willingness to try new things," said Sandeep Murthy, founder and
managing partner at Lightbox Ventures. "Millennials have repeatedly
demonstrated their comfort with technology and openness to new products
and services.

Many emporiums in Asia want to give brick-and-mortar shopping a new kind
of glory

Shhh. Do you hear that? It's the sound of wind whistling through the
abandoned malls of America as the Cassandras of contemporary retail cry
their doom through corridors lined by fronds of lonely greenery: the end
of a way of shopping, and all that.

At the tender age of 18, Therese Malvar has already made remarkable
inroads in her career, portraying roles somehow considered atypical and
fearless.

Unknown to many, this girl who played lesbian in her debut film "Ang
Huling Cha-Cha Ni Anita," wanted to become a nun. Note that she was
named after one, St. Therese Martin.

Singh and Ishan Bansal, Groww sells direct mutual funds through its
platform and plans to roll out other investment products including
stocks soon.

As a self-described political conservative, Reagan Larson might seem to
be a natural fit for the Republican Party. The 19-year-old college
student from South Dakota grew up in a Catholic household that objected
to same-sex marriage, and she remains firmly opposed to abortion.

But in many ways, that is where the ideological similarities end. Ms.
Larson, a dual major in biology and Spanish at Gustavus Adolphus College
in St. Peter, Minn., does not oppose the legalization of marriage
equality. She views climate change as undeniable, believes “immigrants
make our country richer,” and disagrees with her parents on the need for
a border wall.

BuzzFeed is planning to lay off about 15 per cent of its workforce, as
the company seeks to reorient itself in a shifting digital-media landscape.

The cuts could affect about 250 jobs. The firm, among the most
high-profile digital-native publishers, also is looking to realign its
resources to invest more in promising areas of the business such as
content licensing and e-commerce.

Joanna Bassett is an associate at law firm Taylor Wessing

In the 1970s, a new home typically consisted of 83.3m² of floor space.
Nearly 50 years later, a study by LABC Warranty found that in 2018 new
homes built since 2010 measured 67.8m², a decrease of 18.6%. Within the
cities, new-build flats are often far smaller. But when did such
shrinkage become inevitable? Is it the result of the condensed
occupational demands of the *millennial*, or could it be that we are
merely shoehorning our lives into the only spaces left to us by our
predecessors?

Good day. With market regulators on furlough like the rest of
Washington's bureacracy, venture-backed companies are finding creative
ways to break into the IPO market.

Gossamer Bio Inc. said in a filing Wednesday afternoon that it would go
public by letting its registration become automatically effective "as a
result of the shutdown of the federal government." If all goes according
to plan, the company will be able to sell shares to investors in 20
calendar days. New Fortress Energy LLC is set to also attempt using this
workaround, the WSJ reports.

Dogfish Head Craft Brewery, known for beers made with exotic ingredients
that often boast high alcohol levels, is on a health kick.

The Milton, Delaware-based brewer will soon release Slightly Mighty IPA,
a low-alcohol ale (4 percent ABV) with only 95 calories and 3. 6 grams
of carbohydrates, a profile rivaling that of post-workout favorite
Michelob Ultra (95 calories, 2. 6 grams of carbs).

‘Millennials fear surveillance institutions such as Google and Facebook
— but also see them as tempting employers’

When Edward Snowden agreed to speak at Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne
University by video link from Moscow last month, students snapped up the
500 places in the amphitheatre in three minutes. There were 7,000 people
on the waiting list. “We’d never seen that before,” says Patrick Weil, a
French political scientist who is on Snowden’s legal team.

The rich are getting richer, and younger.

A survey of U.S. investors with $25 million or more finds their average
age dropped by 11 years since 2014, to 47. These fabulously rich
Americans, whose ranks have more than doubled since the depths of the
Great Recession, are younger than less wealthy millionaires. The average
age of those with at least a mere $1 million is 62, a number that hasn't
budged in years.
