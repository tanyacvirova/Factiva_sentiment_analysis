The *millennial* former mayor of a midsize city has far surpassed
expectations in the 2020 race. He doesn't get fired up. Can he fire up
people in Iowa?

OTTUMWA, Iowa -- No presidential campaign is spared its awkward moments:
overlong hugs from supporters, groaners about the Iowa weather, white
lies about the caliber of the local cuisine.

Do you earn £70k+? Live to travel? Dress for Instagram... but can't
afford a flat?

After the Boomers, the Yuppies, the Sloanes, the Dinkys (dual income no
kids yet), the Oinks (one income no kids) and the hipsters - for such
has been the pocket history of demographic nicknames since the 1980s -
come the Henrys. Not Hooray Henry and his toff mates, but Henry the
acronym: high earner, not rich yet.

When I heard the sad news this week that Nicholas Parsons had died, I
did what any self-respecting *millennial* wRould and went on social
media. After all, what is 21st century grief, if not communal? As I
posted my own #RIP and sat back to watch the tributes roll in, something
quickly became clear. Those mourning the loss of Radio 4's comedy
ringmaster weren't merely his panel show comrades, or even baby boomers.
My peers were falling over themselves to admit to being Just a Minute
devotees.

So, I wasn't in the least bit surprised to read that the first full set
of audience figures for the BBC Sounds app, which launched in October
2018, have revealed that young listeners are enjoying old radio
programmes. Among the under-35s demographic, The Archers is the second
most requested show - in a top 10 that includes Desert Island Discs, I'm
Sorry I Haven't a Clue and In Our Time, chaired by 80-year-old Melvyn Bragg.

IRST, an apology. For there being no column here today.

FI did try. This being the first of February (ie no longer January, ie
the first day of the new Brexited epoch), I thought I had it in the bag.
Of all the things I could write about (Veganuary, dry January, even
Januhairy, anyone?), the issue of us no longer being members of the
European Union was surely head and shoulders above the rest. A total
breeze. Surely it would all but write itself? I have no idea what else
is to be found in today's magazine, but given how vociferous I've been
on the subject of Brexit over the past 800 years (well, it has seemed
that long, hasn't it?), to not mark the occasion felt wrong, and on
several levels.

Here is something small but big that happened this week and speaks of a
generation gap within journalism. I write from the perspective of having
worked the overnight shift at CBS News when I started out, choosing
stories off the wires to lead hourly newscasts. I was young, and I
sometimes got it wrong in terms of news judgment.

Last Sunday, when Kobe Bryant died, when word was just spreading, a
political reporter for the Washington Post tweeted a link to a Daily
Beast report from 2016 detailing a charge of sexual assault against
Bryant. The 2003 case was settled out of court; it looked ugly and
seemed believable in the broad outlines. The Post reporter apparently
wanted people to remember that Bryant's was not a blameless life and
that the abuse of women is real.

We're the fifth highest users of ATMs in the EU but with banks selling
them off, the 'Pass Machine's' days look numbered, writes John Meagher

Church-gate charity collections have been a feature of Sunday mornings
in this country for as long as anyone can remember. Since time
immemorial, people shuffling out of Mass have rooted around in their
pockets for loose change for the good-cause buckets held by volunteers.

Scottish Conservatives need a bold vision, the leadership frontrunner
Jackson Carlaw tells Kenny Farquharson

As a comfortably upholstered middleaged man of florid complexion,
Jackson Carlaw looks like every *millennial*'s stereotype of a boring
Tory politician. So, Mr Carlaw, are you a gammon? The 60-year-old
chuckles at the slight. "Well, I hope more than that," he says. Yet Mr
Carlaw knows how hard it will be to fill the shoes of Ruth Davidson, a
kick-boxing lesbian who defied those Tory stereotypes.

I read with sadness Megan Marz's Jan. 19 Book World review, 'There's an
exodus from Christianity. These onetime believers explain why.'-The book
'Empty the Pews: Stories of Leaving the Church,' is about the
disillusionment of Gen X and *millennial* writers with the faith of
their youth in which being a 'good Christian' means being straight,
Republican, submitting to your husband and believing the Earth is 6,000
years old.-I have no doubt that younger generations are reacting against
such a small religion; I definitely would and do. But I am (once again)
saddened that all of Christianity seems to be lumped together in this
smallness.

THE MASKED SINGER Saturday 7pm UTV Joel weights cardio I practically
live on steak and potatoes. I try to eat as much as I can because it's
fuel for me to go to the gym. This feels very *millennial*, but if we're
having people round for dinner, we basically go to Nando's and bring it
back to the house. Everyone loves it and everyone knows their order -
you don't have to give anyone a menu.

To see the best return on investment (ROI), brands will have to be early
adopters of a few social media marketing trends we're shining a light on
here. Let's dive in!

As John F. Kennedy aptly said: “Change is the law of life. And those who
look only to the past or present are certain to miss the
future.”.........For anyone in marketing, change is an integral part of
the job. 2019 was a year of significant strides in digital advertising
and marketing space. The evolution of artificial intelligence, voice
search, rise in influencer marketing, increased personalization was some
of the buzzwords this year and the outlook for 2020 remains on similar
lines. To see the best return on investment (ROI), brands will have to
be early adopters of a few social media marketing trends we're shining a
light on here. Let's dive in!

Following a series of fiscal announcements last year, including the
latest Partial Credit Guarantee (PCG) scheme to aid NBFCs and HFCs, this
year is likely to see these schemes coming to fruition, believe industry
insiders

IN KEEPING with its commitment to revive the real estate industry, the
Finance Ministry announced the Partial Credit Guarantee (PCG) scheme
earlier last month as a way of injecting liquidity into Non-Banking
Financial Companies (NBFCs) and Housing Finance Companies (HFCs), which
are the primary lenders to developers in the affordable housing space.
The previous year has been particularly stressful for real estate
lending with ANAROCK Property Consultants estimating approx. $14 billion
'severely stressed' loans in Indian real estate, out of which, loan
advances to builders in MMR and NCR accounting for over 90 per cent share.

Four US senators running for president paused their impeachment trial
duties Friday to dash to Iowa, joining top rivals for a final weekend of
campaigning before the state's all-important vote launches the
Democratic Party's nomination contest.

After a Senate vote Friday paved the way for President Donald Trump's
acquittal of charges of abuse of power and obstruction of justice, the
impeachment trial was put on hold, allowing all candidates to enjoy a
breathless final 72 hours of campaigning before the Iowa caucuses.

Despite New-Year resolutions to eat healthily, for professionals and
millennials who regularly depend on food from outside, all the nutrition
talk might seem futile.

Not anymore, as savvy foodies show us the way. These extra-conscious
food lovers are now reliant on knowledgeable chefs to serve them healthy
options and portions. And guess what? Many chefs seem to be willingly
turning into part-time nutritionists so they can consider the
nutritional value of local ingredients, and recommend patrons healthy
food-based trends including vegan, gluten-free and organic.

Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal on Friday urged the *millennial*
to emulate Swargadeo Sui Ka-Pha and become “ambassadors of peace and
harmony” among the Asean and BBN (Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal) countries.

Sonowal was speaking a function on the occasion of Me-Dam-Me-Phi jointly

district administration at the historic Charaideo Maidam in Charaideo

Let's start with a quick dose of reality: Black professionals find
solace in neither corporate America nor Big Law. To be blunt, both suck.

The numbers tell a sad story. African Americans account for just 0.8% of
Fortune 500 CEOs and 3.2% of senior-level executives and managers,
according to "Being Black in Corporate America," a report by the
nonprofit Center for Talent Innovation. And just 2% of partners in the
Am Law 200 are black—and that doesn't even break out those without equity.

she is learning!24-year-old Anjali Tatrari, who has made her television
debut with this show feels she’s learning a lot from the two experienced
and popular actors “Not just acting tips, I get photography, singing,
skincare, reading tips from them – even life hacks!” she says.Being a
*millennial* who is constantly on the phone, Anjali opens up about
online activism “There is a lot of expectation from millennials to be
relevant and speak out on the net for everything that’s happening, but I
feel it should not be a compulsion to follow a trend, or repost, reshare
about things you don’t know much about. At the same time, using it to
educate yourself about happenings is important too”

Sara Ali Khan who is currently gearing up for the upcoming release 'Love
Aaj Kal' took to her social media handles yesterday to announce her next
film co-starring Akshay Kumar and Dhanush. She shared a photo with
Akshay and Dhanush planting a kiss on Sara's cheeks. The stars were all
smiles in the photos and the fans are excited to see their magic on the
big screen.Today the actress took to her Instagram to share the vibrant
ethnic looks of her from the photo shoot. In the first look, we can see
Sara wearing a white churidar suit enhanced with pink embroidery. She
completed her beautiful look with fuschia eyeshadow and a pair of heavy
earrings.In another look, the *millennial* actress is seen clad in a
yellow ethnic outfit pair with heavy Kundan jhumkas and a bindi. We must
say bindi really suits Sara.

The Economic Survey 2019-20 says that moderation in credit growth was
witnessed across all the major segments of non-food credit, except
personal loans, which continued to grow at a steady and robust pace
during 2019-20 for the data available till November 2019. While credit
to industry and service sector shows a declining trend, the credit
growth to personal loans remains similar.The Survey has said that
despite a decrease in policy rates by the Reserve Bank of India , the
credit growth in the economy has been declining since the beginning of
this year. The bank credit growth (YoY) moderated from 12.9 per cent in
April 2019 to 7.1 per cent as on December 20, 2019.The moderation was
led by a sharp deceleration in credit growth to the services sector.
Credit growth to industry has been very low in the recent months.

Millennials looking to refinance *MILLENNIAL* homeowners are cashing in
on historically low home loan interest rates and are jumping at the
chance to refinance their mortgages. Once labelled the lazy generation,
Millennials are shaping up to be a financially savvy bunch.

According to data from comparison website Finder, 30 per cent of those
surveyed aged between 18 and 39 said they would refinance in the next 12
months, effectively shaving tens of thousands of dollars off their
mortgages. That is compared to just 2 per cent of Baby Boomers who said
they would speak to their lenders.

Going green can benefit staff attraction and retention, provided
organisations demonstrate real commitment.

According to recruiting experts Hays, if genuine talent attraction and

Is your career killing you by stealth? If you feel excessively tired,
devoid of energy, demoralised and irritable, you have the classic
symptoms of a condition with disastrous potential: occupational burnout.

More than half of sick days taken in Britain are caused by work-related
stress, anxiety and depression, according to the UK Health and Safety
Executive. Burnout doesn't only make work feel demoralisingly futile;
studies show that it may precipitate a fatal heart attack or stroke, or
prompt chronic illnesses such as type 2 diabetes or dementia.

While dating apps abound, young people say they are having less sex,
writes Rachel Wells.

Dating apps such as Tinder and Bumble may have made "hooking up"
(arranging sex) easier than ever, yet experts believe the generation
traditionally associated with the most free and easy times - young
people - are having far less fun under the covers than their parents'
generation.

IF 2018 WAS the year that the concept of 'cancel culture' went
mainstream," writes Meghan Daum near the beginning of The Problem With
Everything: My Journey Through the New Culture Wars (Gallery Books),
"then 2019 may be the year that cancel culture cancels itself."

The 49-year-old essayist and novelist writes regularly on feminism,
liberalism, and the weaponization of political correctness. In her new
book, she contends that "by framing Trumpism as a moral emergency that
required an all-hands-on-deck, nodeviation-from-the narrative approach
to cultural and political thought...the left has cleared the way for a
kind of purity policing-enforced and amplified by social media-that is
sure to backfire." The Problem With Everything is her clarion call to
chill out and allow people to be more complicated, contradictory, and human.

Bernie Sanders’ drive for the White House began inauspiciously. On April

In a diverse year, a film about a woman turning the tables on predatory
men became the talking point of the festival

Sundance, the independent film festival held in the skiing town of Park
City, has always been a standalone leftwing outpost in the staunchly
Republican state of Utah. This year’s event promised to be more
politically charged than usual.

What has been the main focus of Mashreq Al Islami in 2019 and why?

When our Chairman Abdul-Aziz Al Ghurair decided to offer Islamic banking
services sometime back, his vision was not just another ‘me-too’ Islamic
player in the Islamic banking space of the UAE. The vision was to roll
out cutting-edge Islamic banking products and services, enabled with
advanced technology, without compromising on any Shari’ah-compliance
principles. Historically, Islamic banks have been considered lacking in
providing quality services and innovative technological solutions for
day to day banking needs.

While many younger consumers have purchased groceries online, it is not
their preferred destination when it comes to food shopping.

That’s just one of the unexpected trends in grocery shopping habits
revealed in a new survey from the University of Southern California
Marshall School of Business. The study, which was authored by Diane
Badame, indicated that online grocery shopping is not a primary grocery
channel for the vast majority of Gen Z and *millennial* shoppers.

John Delaney ends the presidential campaign more or less the way he
started it: in obscurity and in Iowa.

This morning, three days before the Iowa caucus, the former
representative from Maryland announced that he is leaving the
presidential race. He had spent much of his time and energy during his
918-day campaign on the ground in the Hawkeye State, hoping to inspire
grassroots excitement. It didn’t work.

Virgil Abloh, the high priest of *Millennial* street culture, has won
over the establishment with a tagged collection, writes Stephen Todd.

Virgil Abloh's CV reads like a rollcall of urban cool: fashion designer

DJ, graffiti artist, architect.

January 24 marked the annual International Day of Education; a moment to

education. While emphasis is placed on the child in Nigeria, it is not
just the child or just the girl-child. How about those that are managing
to get some form of education and those that are responsible for
educating them? What form of education and what quality of education is
being provided?

Student debt is putting a damper on young Americans' relationship
decisions, according to a new study from private lender LendKey
Technologies.

About one-third of respondents between ages 18 and 34 say they might
postpone marriage — or have already done so — until student debt is paid
off, according to the study, which surveyed 1,037 U. S. adults who
attended college. The study was given to USA TODAY exclusively.

*HD* 	Karma Brown’s Recipe for a Perfect Wife tackles gender stereotypes
and the pursuit of self-discovery; To readers familiar with any of
Brown’s four bestselling novels, such as The Choices We Make and The
Life Lucy Knew, Recipe for a Perfect Wife might feel like a departure
from the tender, moving work she’s known for

*LP* 

	

Each one of bestselling author Karma Brown’s books begins with a “what
if." In the case of her latest novel, that question was: “What if two
women, living 50 years apart, with a shared cookbook between them, lived
in the same house, both with secrets?”

The result of that thought experiment is Recipe for a Perfect Wife,
which tells two stories in parallel: Nellie, a thoroughly Stepford-ian
housewife circa 1950, and Alice, the 29-year-old woman who reluctantly
decamps New York with her husband in the present day. The constant is
the suburban New York dwelling they both live in – and, of course, the
fact that they’re both trying to figure out what they want from life, a
desire increasingly at odds with what all the people around them seem to
want for (and from) them. Add two unlikeable-for-different-reasons
husbands, a hearty helping of white lies that turn into whopping
untruths, a sadness that seems to weep from the very walls of this home,
and you get a discomfiting, page-turning read.

But the likelihood of even more state-mandated regulations has home

31 January 2020 - Pennsylvania-based Penn National Gaming, Inc. (PENN:

agreed to acquire a 36% interest in digital sports media company
Barstool Sports, Inc., to transition to an omni-channel provider of
retail and online gaming and sports betting entertainment, the company said.

Penn National’s initial investment for 36% of the equity of Barstool
Sports is comprised of approximately USD 135m in cash and USD 28m in
shares of non-voting convertible preferred stock. After three years,
Penn National will increase its ownership to approximately 50% with an
incremental investment of approximately USD 62m, consistent with the
implied valuation at the time of the initial purchase.

With their high flying careers, snappy suits and penchant for fancy

correspondents, research stated, "Pyrogenic Carbon (PyC) is ubiquitous
in global environments, and is now known to form a significant, and
dynamic component of the global carbon cycle, with at least some forms
of PyC persisting in their depositional environment for many millennia."

When investors first consider investing in commercial real estate, their
initial thoughts often stray toward properties located in highly
competitive primary markets such as New York City, Boston and Los
Angeles. After all, the old mantra of “location, location, location”
still rightly holds a great deal of sway over real estate market investors.

However, between capitalization rates and rental trends, the secondary
and tertiary cities that represent commercial real estate's
middle-market can potentially outpace the historical trends within
primary markets. And with these middle-market regions experiencing a
significant influx of *Millennial* and Generation Z workforce finding
jobs and building families outside of major metros

As the lines between professional and personal life blur, employees
increasingly want relevant, convenient, and engaging tech experiences
they have outside of work to be replicated on the job.

By 2025, 75 percent of the global workforce will be millenials.
Businesses across verticals, geographies and sizes are already reporting
that millenials and Gen Z make up more than half of their workforce. In
other words, it means that businesses are increasingly working with a
generation that grew up with technology and connecting online.

Sheetal Jain, Founder & CEO, Luxe AnalyticsThe customers' demand for a
seamless, bespoke shopping experience, with a 360 degree access to
retail across all touchpoints is resulting in luxury retail disruption.
Retailers need to devise innovative ways to make their stores meaningful
for new-age luxury buyersLuxury retail is experiencing a paradigm shift.
The traditional ways of doing retail are no more effective and requirea
radical makeover. Mobile commerce is blooming worldwide as growing
number of consumers are using their smartphones to research, compare,
purchase and return products. Does this mean brick-and-mortar stores are
becoming passe? Absolutely true, many iconic retailers like Nordstrom,
Lord & Taylor, Victoria's Secret, Barneys, to name a few, are closing
their retail stores. To remain relevant, these stores are trying to
reinvent themselves by going digital. But, simply moving sales online
will not be enough for their survival.

Are collaboration tools having a positive or negative impact on the way
we work?

The many benefits of collaboration tools - such as Slack, Trello, Asana
and Zoom - are well-documented. The ability to communicate with
colleagues instantaneously, to video chat with remote or international
co-workers, and to organise large and disparate teams is invaluable to
businesses.

January may be a long and dreary month, but it has provided plenty of
dressing inspiration. Fashion month wise, we've seen chic street style
looks from Paris Couture and Copenhagen, both of which offered us great
style tips for what to wear right now, while the Grammys, SAG awards and
Oscars have provided glamorous eveningwear inspiration, too.

As always, we've found it tricky to narrow it down to one single look
that we've loved the most, so you might be surprised at our findings.
Keep reading to find out who the Telegraph fashion team have crowned as
January's best dressed...

White supremacists use the internet to spew myths of victimisation that
legitimise racist ideologies. Their attempts to silence critical voices
in the South African media must be opposed.

As the South African National Editors Forum (SANEF) has noted, far-right
activists have launched a campaign to silence Daniel Friedman, the
digital editor of The Citizen. Friedman, who also performs satirical
material under the name Deep Fried Man, was forced to quit his social
media platforms after antisemitic comments and personal threats to his
safety.

host of challenges in the legal industry, such as *millennial* demands,
succession planning, real estate costs and how to handle lawyers who

When Michael McCain took to Twitter recently to criticize U.S. foreign
policy and the "narcissist in Washington" after the shooting down of a
passenger jet in Iran, killing 57 Canadians and dozens more with ties to
Canada, jaws dropped in many a corporate boardroom.

Conventional and historical wisdom said leaders of big companies like
Maple Leaf Foods, which McCain leads, don't just grab the reins of the
company Twitter account to express exasperation about world affairs.
They particularly don't do so if they're a publicly traded entity. After
all, a CEO's duty is to make money for shareholders, not hold forth on
politics, critique foreign affairs, or advocate for social change.

population surge and social changes caused by the baby boom, you may
feel you're way past hearing about romance and relationships from those
"elders."

Not so fast. Even in their 60s, 70s and beyond, the need/desire for
emotional connections has them on dating sites, meeting strangers in
bars and coffee shops, and, yes, being intimate.

India, Jan. 31 -- Bollywood's superstar, King Khan as he is fondly
called, Shah Rukh Khan and Gauri Khan's daughter, Suhana Khan, may not
have made her debut in Bollywood but her acting in her school
productions like The Sky is Grey is still being appreciated. The young
star kid's qualifications may still be that of a very junior actor from
her father's, but that doesn't stop Suhana. Suhana Khan is that rare
*millennial*, has selective social media presence, but every once in a
while a friend of her's will post a photo of Suhana, and it is bound to
go viral. Like anyone who tries to hide from the public eye, Suhana's
reclusive personality gets her a lot of attention. Well, that's the
thing about Bollywood Royalty like Suhana Khan and the likes of Sara Ali
Khan, their very first media interactions and comments fall flat because
people think they are overhyped. But it's refreshing to see someone who
isn't very desperate for attention.

disabilities.

You may be forgiven if you believe that no Nigerian has won the Grammy
award. It is untrue. In 2007, percussionist and recording artiste Sikiru
Adepoju claimed Grammy glory in the category of Best Contemporary World
Music Album (not to be confused with Best World Music Album). He gained
this win for being a contributing artiste on the album 'Global Drum
Project'; a compilation effort featuring contributions from acts like
Mickey Hart (USA), Zakir Hussain (India), Giovanni Hidalgo (Puerto Rico)
among others.

The race to replace longtime DeKalb County Commissioner Kathie Gannon is
heating up quickly.

Gannon, who has represented District 6 since 2005, announced last week
she wouldn't be seeking reelection. Since then, well-known Clarkston
Mayor Ted Terry decided to drop his bid for a U.S. Senate seat and jump
into the DeKalb race --while community advocate Emily Halevy has already
secured an endorsement from Gannon.

Faith is a purifying element. Faith brings hope and renews enthusiasm
for life. It doesn't necessarily have to be a religious and welcome
faith if it is.

It can be faith in ourselves, in others, in a project, in which we will
overcome ourselves, in the capacity for human resilience, in the
resistance of cultural identities, in the regenerative power of the
desire to live. The longing for life for itself that Khalil Gibran
speaks to us.

Last night on television

The second episode of Inside the Crown: Secrets of the Royals (ITV)
dealt with the tricky relationship between the Royal family and the
press. Does anyone spring to mind? Before the Duke and Duchess of
Sussex, of course, there was Diana, Princess of Wales. But the programme
served to remind us that paparazzi intrusion and tabloid gossip didn't
start there. Fleet Street couldn't get enough of Princess Margaret's
rackety lifestyle, and her marriage was finally killed off by pictures
of her on Mustique with her toyboy lover, Roddy Llewellyn. There was
outrage. "The monarchy was supposed to be the head of our morality!"
spluttered historian Piers Brendon.

The broadest US Democratic presidential field ever has been whittled
down to 12 candidates scrambling for a strong showing in Iowa, the
nomination race's first-in-the-nation vote on February 3.

With no clear favorite in the heartland state, candidates have poured
resources into Iowa hoping to catch a political spark that propels them
to victory -- or at least a spot in the top three.

Ireland's Fine Arts, antiques and collectables column

Once upon a time, the top auction houses stuck to the traditional fare
of old paintings, antique furniture, and silver. Anything that flew
under the banner of the Fine and Decorative Arts was fair game for the
hammer. All of it was old: 'antique' was loosely defined as
more-than-100-years old; anything of more recent origin was termed
'vintage' and frowned upon.
