"Amazing Stories" was birthed in the mid-1980s, when Steven Spielberg's
directing career was at its absolute apex, anthology series were rare,
and top movie people seldom deigned lend their names to television. A
whole lot has changed 35 years later, making this Apple TV+ revival feel
like less of an occasion than the new streaming service might have hoped.

Spielberg's original yielded some very good episodes as well as
forgettable ones. But the main challenge here is arriving when TV (even
the streaming kind) is awash in stars and anthologies, including
Netflix's edgy "Black Mirror"
[https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/05/entertainment/black-mirror-review/index.html]and
CBS All Access' latest return to "The Twilight
Zone,"[https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/01/entertainment/the-twilight-zone-review/index.html]
guided by Jordan Peele.

In a story January 7, about understanding credit, The Associated Press —
in an article supplied by the personal finance website NerdWallet —
erroneously reported that employers are among those who can check
applicants' credit scores. Employers can access only modified credit
reports.

The mortgage market is booming as historically low rates draw consumers
off the sidelines. In Charlotte, lenders are looking to capitalize on
the current environment and prepare for a busy season ahead.

Mortgage applications jumped 10% last week compared to a year ago,
according to Freddie Mac data. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage
reached a historic low at 3.29% on Thursday. Average 15-year fixed-rate
mortgages were at 2.79%.

After reading last week's column titled, is your parenting style
hypocritical, my friend Kaylan sent me a WhatsApp message to tell me
that she shares the same parenting values. She emphasized that she too
apologises to her son, Lance, whenever she is in the wrong.

Kaylan then jokingly said, 'My mother said that she liked my brother and
me the least when we were teenagers.'We both agreed that we will only
find out when our children are grown whether the freedom of expression
we have awarded them will come back and bite us.

Something was different at CPAC 2020.

Sure, Fox News and the NRA were in their regular spots between booths
full of "deplorable" hammocks, Donald Trump nutcrackers and a life-size

Kitchens, ingredients and food philosophies never had as strong an echo
in individual definition as today. For sample, the ideological
motivations behind a vegan diet.

According to the consultancy Lantern, the three fundamental reasons for
deciding this style of food are: respect for the feelings (57 percent),
environment (21) and health (17), and *millennial* women living in large
cities are their main Adept.

With an aging population, and the trillion dollar transfer of wealth to
occur in the face of a shrinking income tax base, and in the face of
what some assert is an increasing concentration of wealth at the top,
the burning question is whether new forms of death taxes will raise
their head, as well as lifetime taxes as governments struggle to balance
budgets, get rid of burgeoning deficits and generally try to put their
financial house in order.

In a prior blog, I outlined some basics of the history of the Canadian
capital gains regime and the recommendations of the Carter Commission
that Canada adopt a capital gains regime which the federal government
adopted in 1972.

I first met Kori Marin when I was at my most vulnerable. I was hugely
pregnant, working full-time, caring for my toddler son and trying to
stage and sell our home in a rabid market. The pressures weighing on me
felt as heavy as, well, a house. I was scared about the extra
responsibilities that would be birthed along with my second child,
scared to put my career on hold for months, scared our house wouldn't
sell for enough money — but, embarrassingly, I was equally scared that
my hairy ankle would poke out from beneath the hem of my pants during a
meeting, revealing that I could no longer reach over my belly to shave
my legs. Somehow, those stupid hairs felt like proof that I didn't
belong anymore.

and make predictions for 2020. Twenty-nineteen was a solid year with an
increase in M&A activity, which made up for a lack of IPOs due to market
uncertainties driven by Brexit, trade wars and political uncertainty.

NEW DELHI, March 6 -- From planning their own vacation itineraries to
trying their hand at decorating ideas, millennials are the generation
that likes to DIY (do-it-yourself ), the catch-all term for getting
things done by yourself rather than enlisting professional help. Having
come of age at a time when the internet was widely and easily
accessible, millennials have earned the tag of "digital natives". They
have the resources and information at their disposal to teach themselves
anything. And investing is no exception.

Saptarshi Nath, a 31-year-old IT consultant based in Gurugram, is part
of this new crop of investors. "When I started investing at around 26, I
considered consulting an expert, but after speaking to the chartered
accountant who files my parents' taxes and my bank's relationship
manager, I realized that they were offering contradictory advice. So I
decided to do my own research and started looking up articles and videos
that helped me get started," he said.

HEALTHIER HAPPIER PET

THESE days we are painfully aware of the toll pollution takes on our
health but what about our furry friends? After all, they share our world
and the impure air we breathe; and there's growing evidence they're just
as affected by harmful toxins as we are maybe even more so.

Remarking on the former vice president's success on Super Tuesday, the
mayor of New York said Mr. Biden had benefited from ''his historic
connection'' to Barack Obama.

Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York drew anger on Thursday by suggesting
that many African-American voters supported former Vice President Joseph
R. Biden Jr. because his record had not been sufficiently examined
beyond his connection to former President Barack Obama.

The employee-enterprise relationship is continuously evolving in the
*millennial* era. Stemming from the new-age employees’ expectations from
the organisation as well as their ability to well articulate their
career needs, the change in relationship is advancing at a pace
demanding informed cognisance. Couple this with recent examples of
mistrust of organisational loyalty in the aftermath of cost-cutting
measures, headcount downsising or even the larger issues of culture fit
and alignment to values, the Human Resource teams of large and small
Enterprises have their jobs cut out for them. So, what exactly are HR
tools? They are nothing but a wide range of technological solutions that
help organisations manage their day to day HR activities effectively. A
workplace, which is installed with the right set of HR tools, enables a
seamless accomplishment of all the HR roles thereby allowing the
organization to function smoothly.

When Reny Huelskamp, 34, and her husband Paul Huelskamp, 36, decided to
move out of their San Francisco rental and buy their first home, they
were drawn to Mill Valley, Calif., about 20 minutes from San Francisco.
In May, they closed on a $2 million, roughly 2,000-square-foot house
with a pool about a block from a lively town square.

"If you grab coffee at the coffee spot downtown, there's a palpable
sense of community," said Mr. Huelskamp, a developer of solar and wind
power plants. "You'll see tons of young families, with their kids and dogs."

Kathmandu, March 6 -- "My workspace is an extended garden for me," says
Maya Ghale from The Plant Shop at Gyanmandala in Jhamsikhel, who set up
her shop in September 2018. When she speaks about her plants, she lights
up and gushes about them as a mother would speaking about her children.
"It's akin to meditation for me?-being responsible for and nurturing my
plants," she says, "I'm cool as a cucumber parenting them."

Maya's words tell one of what most city residents feel-as though the
surface has swelled up (again) and the corners of the city are pushing
against each other. In this ever-shrinking city, plants come as a
blessing to minimise the constricting void for most like Maya.

Bengaluru is set to grow at 9.9 per cent during 2020-2024, the fastest
among key Asian cities on the back of a skilled talent pool, high
availability of quality office stock, low staff costs and rents, and low
living cost

According to the Asia Market Outlook 2020 report released by Colliers
International India - most Asian markets have slowed, but growth in
India is still high. In fact, Bengaluru is expected to grow at 9.9 per
cent during 2020-2024, the fastest among key Asian cities and regions.
Even the Oxford Economics' Global Cities report has predicted that
employment in the city will increase by 3.9 per cent per year on an
average during 2020-24.

"Thank you, sir!" I faintly replied to our attentive crew on what was an
unusually busy weeknight for dining out. His face suddenly beamed,
clearly appreciative of the dignified address, and served us extra
prawns that night. Admittedly, it was also extra gratifying for me.

Technically, a "sir" is reserved for a certain person of status rather
than a casual and social address. Nonetheless, it was delightful to see
how it would uplift people, particularly our attendant that night. With
the nature of my work, it was something I was used to hearing so much
that it became an identity I wanted to wear off. But in many other
instances, "sir and ma'am" can instantly put people at ease.

Loneliness is a big modern trend — it is also a profitable opportunity
for marketers to provide solutions Earlier this year, Samsung unveiled a
spectacular new offering, NEON, at the much awaited Annual Consumer
Electronics Show (CES) at Las Vegas. NEON was the talk of the show,
because it was an “artificial human”.

Unlike an AI assistant or chatbot, which merely provides answers to
queries, NEON is a virtual being that behaves like a real human
companion who can be a friend, display emotions, converse and even
sympathise with you. NEON is not meant to replace human jobs, but on the
other hand, it could help combat loneliness. It could offer human-like
company to the elderly, the sick and the lonely. It could be their
confidant, or just their gossip partner. In other words, NEON will serve
lonely people.

Remaining closed for over a month, Paul’s Pocket, a bookstore in Hefei,
capital city of east China’s Anhui Province, has dabbled in online
reading events via WeChat, in an effort to mitigate the effect of the
coronavirus outbreak.

“The epidemic is throwing a hard punch at the bookstore. Even if we
resume operation, the revenue of the first half of the year will plummet
and we may have to close down if we can’t afford the manpower expenses
and rental costs,” said Zhu Sha, one of the founders of the bookstore.

Top banker Tan Su Shan's combination of leadership and inclusivity makes
her a role model for International Women's Day

SHE MAY BE a high-flying banker at the top of her game, but DBS's Tan Su
Shan is also refreshingly down-to-earth. She wasn't always cool, calm
and Covid-19 battle-ready of course, but after three decades in the
business she's more capable than most – with the credentials (including
a place on all essential power lists) to prove it. It's easy to imagine
Ms Tan, who's in her 10th year at DBS and now Group Head of
Institutional Banking, at ease and in control of just about any situation.

India, March 6 -- Vishal Punjabi's office in Versova is a quaint place
which he has beautifully decorated with candles and flowers, and it is a
perfect replica of his image and persona. As we sit down in his
extremely tech-savvy office, Vishal, who has shot the wedding videos of
celebrities such as Bipasha Basu Singh Grover and Anushka Sharma, starts
the interview by saying that he wants to bust the myth that he only does
celebrity weddings. "The idea is to look for the right kind of people
who really want a memory and value a wedding video. We don't shoot
videos only at actors' weddings. We do all kinds of weddings - small
budget, big budget, destination or otherwise," says Vishal, who can very
well be called the man who has reinvented the idea of the big fat Indian
wedding by making "wedding videos a necessity", and not just an add on.

Dating app Tinder has pledged up to $1 million in in-app advertising to
support women entrepreneurs in India. Tinder is inviting applications
from companies where at least 50% of the founding team are women or
identify as women. To qualify, companies should be under 3 years old,
have cumulatively raised less than Rs 35 crores in equity financing, and
actively target Gen-Z and *millennial* audiences in India. Both
for-profit and not-for-profit entities may apply. “Entries will be
accepted on a first come first serve basis for up to 25 startups,
subject to meeting all eligibility criteria, and applications will close
on the 31st of March 2020. Only the first 500 applications will be
considered,” it said in a statement. Over 90% of Tinder’s community is
between the ages of 18-30, and for any women-owned business aimed at
that cohort, the ads are intended to support their business, grow their
network and help them speak directly to potential consumers.

Long days looking through a lens yield some key life lessons FOCUS on
what’s important and let the rest of the noise fade out. That’s a mantra
Toowoomba photographer, and former Northwest Queensland station manager,
Jo Thieme lives by.

It’s also a disposition you could use to sum up her fine-art imagery.
Her pictures zero in on the heart of the action: jockeys primed as they
jump from the gates at a bush racing carnival, or the sheer power of a
stock horse making a big sliding stop, with dust flying, at the
Cloncurry Stockman’s Challenge, The noise – like rusty panels from an
old arena, spectators watching on or lopsided hessian – is removed from
the frame.

In Paris, there's a hotel to suit every taste and need, from temples of
pampering to a hip hangout for Millennials - and the perfect place for a
tryst

When it comes to hotels with character, Paris has more than anywhere
else on earth, from quaint little hotels de charme to glittering palaces
on steroids. But which to choose? It's not always a matter of budget. If
your taste tends to mid-century furnishings and avo on toast, you won't
be comfortable with swags of velvet and silverservice Eggs Benedict.
Happily, whatever your inclination and aesthetic, Paris has a hotel for
you. Here's a guide to help you decide

his Super Tuesday route and reinstalled him as the party's 2020
frontrunner was thanks in no small measure to some of the most reliable
voters in the Democrats' wide coalition:

First fall in three years and China sales down 10 per cent, even before
impact of coronavirus

The value of the global art market shrank 5 per cent to $64.1bn in 2019,
its first fall in three years, as trade tensions and other economic
issues dragged the numbers down, even before the impact of Covid-19. So
finds this year’s bellwether industry report written by the economist
Clare McAndrew and published by Art Basel and UBS today.

As a *millennial* working in the pensions industry, I encounter terms
like ‘retirement' and ‘drawdown' daily, and it still all seems very far
off. And if it's abstract for me, it's even more ephemeral for people
who don't regularly come across these terms in their day job. On
average, millennials graduate with £32k-£50k in student-loan debt, and
18-36-year-olds spend a third of post-tax income on rent.[1]After that,
a pension is unlikely to be the top savings priority; it's probably
buying a house. Someone may use a short-term savings account for a
student loan, then a separate ISA for a home deposit (not forgetting
their pension account too!). However, separating these goals can lead to
irrational decisions, like keeping a savings account for a holiday while
running significant credit-card debt.

Meredith Corp. said it has gathered years worth of information on what
its readers are interested in. This year, the women’s publisher hopes to
finish implementing the system that gathers it, which will allow
Meredith to use that information more efficiently as it seeks to grow
its video offerings and its commerce business, while continuing to
invest in its data platform. Those three things are the main goals for
2020, Meredith CEO Tom Harty said.

Strap yourself in. WeCrashed tells the story of the dizzying rise and
spectacular fall of co-working start-up WeWork, a high-flying unicorn
that lost its wings after flying too close to the sun (apologies for the
mangled mythological metaphor).

"With his billowing robe, flowing black hair and arms outstretched, Adam
[Neumann] looked more like a preacher than what he really was: the chief
executive of a multibillion-dollar start-up called WeWork and Adam was
here to spread the spirit of 'We'," narrates David Brown, host of
WeCrashed as well as Business Wars, his other podcast that looks at
private enterprise through the lens of competition (Facebook vs
Snapchat, Netflix vs Blockbuster).

CHRISTOPHER, Ill. (AP) — Courtney Young tells a small crowd gathered
here that young people are quickly taking over as the largest voting-age
bloc in America. On one end of the age spectrum, her audience includes
middle-schoolers not yet old enough to vote, and on the other, retirees
into their 80s.

“If every young person went out and voted, they could decide an entire
election," says Young, chair of the newly created Young Democrats of
Franklin County, Illinois. “The issue we have right now is things won’t
change if you people stay idle, stay in that mindset and don’t get out
and vote.”

Alexander Hoyle is making flowers cool again, with a blooming following
on Instagram, and spells at some of our most well-known gardens

Alexander Hoyle is not a typical *millennial*. He finished school at 16,
in order to work in a garden near his home, then went on to
horticultural college at Pershore, followed by three years at historic
Aberglasney in Wales. There the head gardener, ­Joseph Atkin, told him
he ought to go to Kew. So he did. After a spell running the Royal
Botanic Garden[https://www.kew.org/] rose garden, he left to set up his
business.

Ruthless labor exploitation? Generational betrayal? Understanding the
job crisis in academia requires a look at recent history.

The humanities labor market is in crisis. Higher education industry
trade publications are full of essays by young Ph.D.s who despair of
ever finding a steady job. Phrases like “unfolding
catastrophe[https://connect.chronicle.com/CS-WC-2019-EndgameCollection_Landing-Page.html]”
and “extinction
event[https://www.chronicle.com/interactives/20190510-academes-extinction-event]”
are common. The number of new jobs for English professors has fallen
every year since 2012, by a total of 33 percent.

Charleston, S.C. - Benefitfocus, Inc. (NASDAQ: BNFT), a leading
cloud-based benefits management platform and services provider, today
published findings that suggest that driving engagement and
participation in supplemental voluntary benefits, particularly in at
least one of five key voluntary benefits, can help increase employee
retention rates. The correlation between retention and participation in
these benefits is stronger in companies with predominantly younger workers.

In its latest Benefit Insight Brief, Benefitfocus found that employers
could see a reduction of up to 8 percent in employee turnover when
employees are enrolled with at least one of five specific benefit
categories, and those with a predominantly *millennial* workforce could
potentially reduce employee turnover by as much as 24 percent.

Yet another indication the tight labor market has shifted power to job
seekers: A new study has found about 1 in 6 job offers are rejected.

That’s a 5-year high, according to job review site
Glassdoor[https://www.glassdoor.com/research/why-candidates-reject-offers/],
which analyzed data from almost 100,000 job candidates. The job offer
rejection rate was about 20 percent in 2010, dropped steadily over the
next five years, to 15.9 percent in 2015, and has been rising since,
reaching 17.3 percent in 2019.

The annual Fetes des Beignets is upon us, and maitre chocolatier and
chef patissier Thierry Busset is celebrating Mardi Gras with a
month-long promotion that pays tribute to his mother by recreating her
signature recipe for the sweet dough French confections that became a
childhood favourite.

It is not too late to take in Thierry Chocolate's Mardi Gras offerings
that include half a dozen French beignets made à la minute and served
with a choice of house-made chocolate, raspberry or caramel dipping
sauces (until March 19).

The red sign on the red-draped table reads, “Stop Socialism. Unleash
Capitalism.” For an exhibitor at America’s largest annual conservative
shindig, it’s a slogan as truism, as ubiquitous as U.S. flags and Make
America Great Again caps.

But the actual political messaging by Young Conservatives for Carbon
Dividends (YCCD) borders on subversive. At its booth, sandwiched between
the Federalist Society and a pro-Electoral College group, smartly
dressed students make the case for Republicans to accept mainstream
climate science and support a carbon tax as a capitalist solution.

Millennials now represent a significant majority of U.S. homebuyers,
according to the National Association of Realtors (NAR), though there
are notable demographic differences between older millennials (which NAR
describes as those between 30 and 39 years old) and younger millennials
(between 22 and 29 years old).

According to NAR's 2020 Home Buyers and Sellers Generational Trends
Report released Thursday, older millennials and younger millennials
represent 25% and 13% of buyers, respectively, compared to Gen Xers
(ages 40 to 54) who made up 23% of the market.

Remember when Elizabeth Warren was going to save the Democratic Party?

Back in 2016, it looked as if she had been engineered in a lab to broker
a truce between the Democratic establishment and a resurgent left.
Instead, she has spent the last year caught in the crossfire between the
two camps. It’s a bloody tale with important lessons for would-be
peacemakers in the Democratic civil war.

In a newsletter last
week[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/personal-finance/household-finances/article-how-a-former-bay-street-lawyer-got-herself-deep-in-debt/]
, Vancouver lawyer Monique Shebbeare shared the story of how she ended
up deep in debt. After leaving a job on Bay Street in Toronto, Ms.
Shebbeare found herself with more than $50,000 in debt plus the mortgage
on her condo. Here’s her point-by-point look at how she became entirely
debt-free over 14 years, aside from a mortgage.

I cut my expenses: This meant making difficult decisions months after I
originally should have made them (rent out my condo, move in with
roommates). Then I learned how to think ahead. I got used to doing
without much in the way of new clothes, travel and eating out,
especially at the beginning when having enough for basic monthly
cut-back expenses was not a given.

February and March, according to Ellie

Wit’s in a name: The ink from Week 1370

In Week 1370 the Empress asked you to write about someone using only the
letters in that person's name, along with an optional short title. We
got some amazing entries, including a full-page synopsis of "Hamilton"
and a full-on Trump tweetstorm (see the bottom of the column). The
entries were written before the Democratic field shrank; we think the
ones about the now-ex-candidates are still worth sharing.

When it comes to hotels with character, Paris has more than anywhere
else on earth, from quaint little hôtels de charme to glittering palaces
on steroids. But which to choose? It’s not always a matter of budget. If
your taste tends to mid-century furnishings and avo on toast, you won’t
be comfortable with swags of velvet and silver-service Eggs Benedict.
Happily, whatever your inclination and aesthetic, Paris has a hotel for
you. Here’s WISH Magazine’s guide.

— Company Curates Advisement, Mentorship and Community to Connect Women
to Necessary Resources

PURCHASE, NY — A desire to problem-solve lies at the heart of young
women entrepreneurs and this desire starts at a young age. In fact, a
recent study* commissioned by Mastercard found that fifty two percent of
Gen Z and 44 percent of *Millennial* women cited being able to help
others as an important factor in determining their future or current
career path. Mastercard knows that women have the ideas and passion that
can Start Something Priceless, but sometimes the path to actualizing
those ideas isn’t easy, especially when starting your own business.

It's 5:43 a.m. in Orlando — the sky dark, the weather frigid — but I am
nonetheless ecstatic and feeling like a supermom because my 9-year-old
and I are en route to Disney's Hollywood Studios to ride the new, wildly
popular Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance. Or so we hope.

Despite increased adoption, ESG measurement for listed companies across
the globe remains a challenge and requires deeper use of analytics
techniques for performance assessment and reporting. Asset managers must
deploy intelligent analytics tools to assess the alignment of
investments with the sustainable investment goals for performance
measurement and impact assessment.

Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) investment has gained
traction in recent times, with growing patronage from institutional as
well as *millennial* high-net-worth investors. ESG investments were
pegged at $20 trillion in AUM in 2018, according to a Forbes article.
Socially and environmentally aware *millennial* investors, with a pulse
on key issues of our times such as climate change/gender equality, can
be credited for driving interest as well as investments into companies
with strong ESG profiles.

Europe, March 5 -- Business Chief speaks with Wendy Rowe, Director of
Product, Vision and Strategy for Cloud Strategy Operations at Wolters
Kluwer Tax and Accounting (Europe) on the first generation to grow up
with technology: Generation Z.

Generation Z (Gen Z) is the first generation to grow up with technology.
The older members of this generation have likely experienced the
frustrations of dial-up connection at the turn of the century, through
to the ease of making payments via Alexa at the start of this decade.
This is a generation that is often welded with its *Millennial*
predecessors, both in misconceptions and tastes. To discuss this
further, we speak with Wendy Rowe, Director of Product, Vision and
Strategy for Cloud Strategy Operations at Wolters Kluwer Tax and
Accounting (Europe). Rowe's experience in the industry bears a holistic
understanding of Gen Z's technology preferences and how the generation
has fared in the workplace in recent years.

TORONTO — The creator of a new film inspired by late Toronto mayor Rob
Ford's tumultuous tenure says while it centres on his drug scandal that
rocked the city in 2013, thematically the drama is more about the
political and economic climate facing millennials at the time.

Toronto filmmaker Ricky Tollman wrote and directed "Run This Town,"
which stars Ben Platt as a young Toronto newspaper reporter who goes
from writing clickbait Top 10 lists to investigating the scandalous
mayor after layoffs at the publication.
