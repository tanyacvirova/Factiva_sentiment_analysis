MALAYSIA has firmly established itself as an Islamic hub in the world
through leadership and innovative product offerings in the niche industry.

While most of the success in the Islamic financial realm owed to the
government has created a comprehensive legal and regulatory framework,
commercial banks and Islamic financial institutions are the ones that
have completed the Islamic financial system, operating in parallel to
the conventional system.

2019 was a watershed year for Hong Kong’s banking sector, with the Hong
Kong Monetary Authority ushering in a new era of virtual banking by
granting eight virtual banking licenses. Since then, there has been a
huge amount of fanfare around how the newly minted virtual banks will
transform the banking industry in Hong Kong, which for a long time has
been criticized for being too slow to adapt to the digital revolution.

In response, incumbent banks in Hong Kong have been investing heavily in
new technologies and refocusing towards virtual offerings in an attempt
to fend off attack from the new virtual banks and target the more
digitally savvy *millennial* population.

When you’re trying to solve a problem, it helps to take inspiration from
your peers. The Reserve Bank of India, too, is not averse to taking cues
from other central banks in developed countries to come up with ideas to
stimulate the economy during the slowdown. First, it took a leaf out of
the US Fed’s book and carried out ‘Operation Twist’, to quell rising
rates. Now it is hoping to roll out long-term repo operations (LTROs),
taking cues from the European Central Bank. On February 6, the RBI
announced the infusion of Rs. 1 lakh crore into the system in phases,
through the LTRO.

What is it?

MILLENNIALS are putting their lives at risk on our roads in alarming
numbers. New research from Driver Safety Australia has found young
drivers know little about maintaining their cars.

Many don’t know the basics of checking oil and coolant and tyre
pressures. Based on a survey of more than 600 young drivers,
*millennial* motorists would prefer to spend money on their social life
than replace a brake or headlight.

Fujifilm has been a pioneer in providing imaging solutions across the
globe. With over 85 years of rich experience, it has not just been a key
player of the global imaging business, but has also helped shape the
industry through its timely and relevant innovations. Laying the
foundation In the early 2000s, Fujifilm, led by its Chairman Shigetaka
Komori, reacted quickly to the steep decrease in demand for colour-film
business and brought some fundamental reforms with the vision to thrive
as a leading enterprise. Driven by the simple but profound goal of
creating meaningful advancements, Fujifilm reinvented itself as a
one-stop solution provider in the imaging specialty. The company
revamped itself by reimagining the six businesses — digital imaging,
optical devices, highly functional material, graphic systems, document
solutions and healthcare.

By Uma ShashikantThe hero of our story just found a good job after
graduating. He moved into a new city with the excitement of becoming
independent. Our man soon discovered this truth: His life is not going
to be like that of his parents. The yardsticks of success and
accomplishment were no longer the same.First, he found his work to be
far from distinctive. He was one among the thousands that joined the
firm every year. Managers determined what had to be done, how and when.
There did not seem to be much autonomy. The hours were long, and the
work was hard. He found more similarities to his grandfather’s
description of the assembly line of those times, except that this was an
intellectual process, flowing in a design he had no control over or
contribution towards.Second, he wasn’t sure there was scope to grow. His
father told him to work with an eye on the boss’ seat and that would
ensure success. The job was mostly repetitive. There wasn’t much
application of mind or problem-solving.

Digital bank Volt is partnering with billionaire Nigel Austin’s Cotton
On Group to tap into four million customers in the retailer’s loyalty
program and its employees, amid an intensifying battle by new banks to
win customers from incumbents.

Volt’s partnership with Cotton On follows the new bank’s earlier
alliances with payments giant PayPal and ASX-listed Collection House. It
forms part of Volt’s plan to have more than 10 domestic partnerships
over the medium-term as it rolls out more products to become a
fully-fledged bank.

They’re exploring the world more than their older counterparts and
taking roads less travelled, but what does today’s generation want from
travel, asks Ewan McDonald

For children of the 60s, the first big adventure was likely that Air New
Zealand flight into Heathrow, through LAX or Hong Kong. Born in the 70s,
it was probably a campervan wheezing around 27 cities in Europe in 30
days, some of which you may remember. Laos, Cambodia among the earliest
stamps in your passport? Chances are you’re from the early 80s.

Retail plays a critical role in the overall Indian economy, being a
dynamic and evolving industry and being driven by changing consumption
patterns. Like all other industries, it goes through its cycle of ups
and downs in keeping with the macro economic cycles and sentiments. But
the overall retail eco-system - including retail brands, retail solution
providers across categories, retail consultants and others involved in
the retail business one way or the other - offers enough scope for
collaborations, partnerships and investments. So whether you are a
retailer looking to tap the Indian market, or looking to partner with
Indian retail solution providers for better in-store branding, or you
are a retail solution provider looking to collaborate with Indian
solution providers through investments or tie-ups or any other
partnership means, the Indian retail space has a lot to offer.

Many Americans are more interested in practicality than ideology when
choosing a candidate

Given the enthusiastic reader response to the  previous Swamp Notes
disagreement between myself and Ed over the Democratic debates and the
former New York City mayor, I’m going to pick up that thread in my own

The HELOC business is booming, but traditional lenders risk losing
market share.

Rising home values, flat wage growth, record levels of consumer debt and
interest rate uncertainty have driven home equity line of credit (HELOC)
loan origination to record highs. In fact, a 2018 report from Freddie
Mac[http://www.freddiemac.com/research/forecast/20170921_looking_ahead_to_2018.page?]
projects that HELOCs will continue to be a key market driver well into
the future.

The Securities and Exchange Commission's best-interest standard is
slated to take effect in a little more than four months, but there are
still plenty of fights left with respect to regulating the industry.

A high-profile lawsuit continues to linger and the first state moved on
Feb. 21 to implement a fiduciary standard of its own, but financial
services professionals nevertheless are preparing for the implementation
of the SEC standard on June 30.

Lindsey Loughman should be a model client for any financial adviser
looking to connect with the next generation of investors. At 33, Ms.
Loughman is a senior manager at a large consulting organization, earns a
six-figure income, contributes to her 401(k) and participates in an
employee-stock program.

She believes she has too much cash tied up in savings and wants to
invest, but her company discourages individual stock buying to avoid
insider-trading allegations. She wants advice on how to invest in funds,
what to do with her company stock, how to rollover some orphaned 401(k)s
from previous employers and how to buy a home in the near future.

The 2020 presidential election season has been a bewildering mess so
far. At Ad Age, though, we rely on a clarifying principle: You can start

Williamson examines the history of Austin TX. In the 1990s, when the
Great *Millennial* Tech Boom was really just getting going and the
sudden presence of fresh shiny silver and black Volkswagen Jettas
announced the arrival of an unexpected new kind of energetic
high-momentum young money on the streets of Austin--formerly a sleepy
college town formed the great imposing socioeconomic Berlin Wall between
the high-on-irony undergraduate Caucasians eating spinach enchiladas and
taking seven years to get a bachelor's degree over at the University of
Texas and the earnestly and unironically poor and brown and dangerous
precincts of East Austin. Big Tech Money changed all that, and by the
end of the 1990s. Austin had a higher apartment-occupancy rate than New
York City's.

Foundation, concealer, a little eyeliner… More and more men now put on
makeup on a daily basis. Priya Elan meets the influencers behind the
trend – and has a makeover himselfShare your experiences

The first time I tried on makeup I was six years old and my older sister
decided to cover me in sickly raspberry-coloured glittery lipstick
following the “more is better” mantra and the ethos, “it’s not on the
lips, it’s around the lips.”

With so many ways to spin and distort information these days, a
presentation needs to do more than simply share great ideas-it needs to
support those ideas with credible data.

That's true whether you're an executive pitching new business clients, a
vendor selling her services or a CEO making a case for change. How you
present data can double-or decimate-its impact, so take note of these
ways to ensure that your data is doing its job:

While technology continues to play an increasing role in brand strategy
and consumer experience, gamechanging difference can only happen when
brands seamlessly integrate technology into every aspect of their
business to solve some real life problems. N. Chandramouli, CEO, TRA
Research cites two examples to make a strong case for technology focused
brand strategies. While these examples may apparently be far removed
from the retail business, they do offer a lesson on how the right
application of technology can make a meaningful front-end impact. Read
on...Technology is only as good as the use it is put to, and in the last
decade technology has enhanced qualityof- life tremendously, by
providing consumers with convenience, price, access and speed. Till now,
technology and brand worked together; examples like AR, wearables,
online aggregation, EVs, IoT, AI, have brought better and more enriching
consumer experiences.

Leading real estate platform Lamudi will hold its fourth year of the
annual Broker Awards Night on March 19, 2020, at Makati Shangri-La. The
event serves as a venue for real estate professionals and companies to
get together and celebrate each other's achievements for the past year
in real estate.

The property industry has been enjoying a steady upward trend, spurred
by growing demand not only in Metro Manila but also in provincial
cities. According to Lamudi's 2019 data, the young '*millennial*'
generation aged 25-34 is in the lead in terms of interest in property,
followed by those aged 35-44 years old. To respond to this growing
demand, the supply of real estate listings has also seen a great increase.

KATY TUR, MSNBC HOST: Welcome to Monday. It is MEET THE PRESS DAILY. I`m
Katy Tur in New York, in for Chuck Todd. And five days before the South
Carolina primary, we have got a brand new poll out of that crucial
state. Joe Biden has called South Carolina his firewall but according to
this new NBC News Marist poll, he`s holding just a narrow lead over
Bernie Sanders. Biden leads Bernie Sanders by four points, 27 to 23
among the likely Democratic primary voters in South Carolina. And that
is within the margin of error.

Coca-Cola is piloting a new brand that would continue its shift away
from sugar.

The Atlanta-based beverage giant partnered with its Minute Maid
subsidiary to develop a new drink called Cidewinder, which it describes
as having "similar digestive health benefits as kombucha but with less
sugar." The company is testing this cultured juice in Texas and
California grocery and convenience stores. The company filed a
trademark[https://trademarks.justia.com/884/52/cidewinder-88452718.html]
for Cidewinder in May 2019.

2020 FEB 24 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at
Global Warming Focus -- New study results on climate research have been
published. According to news reporting originating from Le Bourget du
Lac, France, by VerticalNews correspondents, research stated, "North
Africa is the largest source of mineral dust on Earth, which has
multiple impacts on the climate system; however, our understanding of
decadal to centennial changes in African dust emissions over the last
few millenniums is limited. Here, we present a high-resolution
multiproxy analysis of sediment core from high-elevation Lake Bastani,
on the island of Corsica, to reconstruct past African dust inputs to the
western Mediterranean area over the last 3150 cal BP."

PHILADELPHIA—If you've been to the theatre lately, you may have noticed
something missing: the intermission.

The musical “Come From Away,” about what happened in Gander, N.L., when
38 planes were stranded there on Sept. 11, 2001, came and went from the
Academy of Music this season without a break in its 100 heartfelt
minutes. “The Band's Visit” was even shorter. In 95 minutes, it also
told a story about extending a warm welcome to accidental visitors,
running straight through to their departure.

MEXICO CITY., February 24.- By commemorating at Campo Marte, Flag Day,
representatives of the Legislative and Judicial Powers called for
creating policies for women and preventing femicides from continuing to
rise in our country.

At the ceremony where President Andrés Manuel López Obrador did not
speak, recalling the femicides of Abril Pérez, Ingrid Escamilla, and
Fátima, the president of the Chamber of Deputies Laura Rojas Hernández,
pointed out that today, Mexican women are fed up, desperate and furious
about brutal death, harassment and pay disparity.

Tang Dynasty "The God of Poetry," Li Bai, regarded as the most
spectacular and recognized Chinese poet of all time, wrote the following
poem: "With my old friend we said goodbye in the Tower of the Yellow
Crane, he set off for Yangzhou in the burgeoning and prosperous March.
The shadow of the solitary candle disappeared into the blue sky, i only
saw the Yangtze River flow to the distant horizon." With this poem, the
city of Wuhan became a very famous and splendid place throughout Chinese
history.

Wuhan, capital of Hubei Province, has an area of more than 8,500 square
kilometers and a total population of more than 10 million. It is located
in the center of the country, where it crosses China's Mother River -
the Yangtze River - which divides the city into three districts Wuchang,
Hankou and Hanyang.

The Record has published numerous articles in recent years identifying
the needs of the homeless. I have met many of these gentle but troubled
souls over the years in downtown Kitchener and elsewhere. They need
places to live for sure, but much more as well.

Homelessness is a *millennial*-old issue. Mental illness, physical
disabilities, severe addictions, poverty and lack of affordable housing
all contribute. Long-term treatment and supports are needed.

PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 24, 2020 /CNW/ -- With the rapid growth of the
cannabis industry in the US and abroad, demand for niche-specific
consulting, advertising, marketing, and design services are continuing
to grow exponentially. Baby boomer Claudia Post and *Millennial*
Jonathan Monk are leading the charge.

Over 11 years ago, MOST launched as Smokin' Hot Solutions – "We create
the buzz." Their name and brand represented who they were, and the
demographics of cannabis business owners at the time, but not now,
because things have changed dramatically. As time went on, their agency
and expertise, as well as their reputation spread.

At 27, Samantha has goals for the future, but feels hindered by mounting
debt. How much exactly? $18,000 on a line of credit, and she's not
entirely sure how all that spending racked up.

“It's hard to pinpoint how I ended up spending so much money, but likely
a combination of the following: shopping, two annual life insurance
payments, and a recent vacation to visit friends in Europe,” she says.

Uganda remains Kenya’s key source market in Africa with great potential
to grow beyond the current level since the destination serves as an
alternative quick getaway. The country's top tourism marketer, Kenya
Tourism Board (KTB) reports that Uganda is Kenya’s leading source
markets currently ranked number one in Africa and number two globally in
terms of arrivals into Kenya. In 2019 Kenya received 215,894 visitors
from Uganda, a 5.4 per cent increase over the previous year. The key
contributing factors for these growth has been the open borders,
Ugandans need only an ID/resident permit to travel to Kenya, the bulging
*millennial* population in Uganda (nearly 26 per cent of the population
according to World Bank), trends on group travel.There is also enhanced
accessibility – operating flights, Kenya Airways, Jambojet, RwandAir and
Uganda Airlines which launched a direct flight to Mombasa last year.

Hired by IBM in 1984 plaintiff claimed her 2016 termination at age 55
arose from age-based reorganizations that began in 2012 when Rometty
became CEO. Rometty allegedly created a "*Millennial* Task Force" to
meet the goal of a "workforce comprised of 75% millennials." IBM
objected  Rometty's and chief human resources officer Gherson's
deposition before others. Plaintiff argued they were "architects and/or
approved of IBM's systemic effort to create a younger workforce" and had
relevant knowledge about the allegedly discriminatory plan that led to
her firing. Despite denying IBM's request to delay Gherson's deposition,
the court delayed Rometty's deposition until plaintiff deposed others
and showed Rometty had personal, non-duplicative information.
Plaintiff's complaint did not show Rometty had unique knowledge not
otherwise held by lower-level executives.

When it comes to the legal industry, the stereotype that boomers are
more tech-averse compared to millennials doesn't hold much weight,
according to a recently released survey of international legal departments.

Released last month, the Association of Corporate Counsel's ACC Chief
Legal Officers Survey found tech adoption rates among *millennial* and
boomer chief legal officers are similar.

The biggest single factor influencing tourism in the 2020s however, will
be technology and the continued rise of smart solutions.

AS WE enter a new decade, India's tourism industry is standing at a
crossroads: in one direction we can see, on the not-too-distant horizon,
the many benefits associated with being one of the world's most popular
international visitor destinations. In the other direction a tourist
economy which has already started paying dividends and is primarily
focused on domestic growth.

Why are some millennials more financially secure than others? The answer
has to do with individual life choices.

Americans who graduate high school, start working, get married, and have
children—in that order—are significantly less
likely[https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/dNxIC0RXzNCJWo0mTw5w5b?domain=aei.org]
to fall into poverty than others. These four core life choices, when
sequenced together, provide the best path to a prosperous future.

An established line of psychological theory is that what we experience
in late adolescence and early adulthood ends up having a large pull on
our behaviour throughout life. And economic gut punches pack a wallop.

Numerous studies have shown those entering the job market during a
recession suffer significant and long-term income penalties, compared
with those who graduate into a robust job market. That's the economy
dealing you a tough hand. But our own behaviour is affected by economic
cycles, too, and that can play out in ways good and bad for lifelong
finances.

When it comes to choosing a place to live during retirement, LGBTQ
people want the same things that everyone else wants — safety,
reasonable prices, agreeable climate, cultural and recreational
amenities and good health care. However, LGBTQ people have a few
additional factors to consider.

THE End of the world is said to follow the construction of a third
Jewish Holy Temple in Jerusalem, which according to some, will be a
prophetic sign of the biblical apocalypse.

Biblical conspiracy theories allege the construction of a Third Holy
Temple in Jerusalem will herald the end of the world. Jewish eschatology
concerning the end times claims the Holy Temple will rise from the
ground before prophesied days of the apocalypse. Many evangelists and
Christian doomsday preachers believe the Third Temple will appear before
the return of Jesus Christ.

Allstate continues to explore several avenues for usage-based insurance.
The company’s major efforts fall into two brands: the more traditional
Drivewise, which appends to a traditional policy and offers discounts
based on driving habits; and the newer Milewise, which uses the
technology to charge a per-mile rate based on driving use.

Milewise’s per-mile rate is generally deduced based on driving habits,
and can change every month. In Arizona, Allstate is piloting an even
more rapid response to improved driving habits: Rates can be adjusted
every week.

Leaving behind taboos, historical conventions and sexist apprehensions,

does so with a growing supply and demand curve in recent years, with
dozens of laboratories willing to meet the needs of an audience that is
finally free to care for their genitals. Moisturizers, epilators,
perfumes, deodorants and other products designed for the intimate parts
of men enjoy an increasingly relevant attention, fleeing the underground
of sex shops and energizing an industry that foresees growth exponential
income: men's cosmetics will be valued at 55 billion euros by 2026,
according to Reportlinker. Up to 22% more than the data collected in 2016.

After his debut at the G20 - this weekend, at the meeting of finance
ministers and central bankers - Economy Minister Martin Guzmán will seek
to accelerate between now and tomorrow, in Washington and New York, a
process that has so far had more than concrete progress: the deepest and
most orderly restructuring of external debt.

Alberto Fernandez chose him as a minister largely for his academic
expertise in sovereign debt - cultivated precisely in New York at
Columbia University - because in his vision fixing the debt is the key
to a successful presidential run, a lesson that he believes he has
learned from his years as Chief of Staff of Nestor Kirchner.

attention, governments and society are focusing on the public agenda the
issue, which imposes a situation to bring about change progress in the

Idoubt that Al Pacino is bothered if I feel sorry for him or not, but
Al, I do. His 40-year-old exgirlfriend Meital Dohan has broken the vow
of omerta that usually surrounds celebrity break-ups and said that his
age was a problem. Describing the 79-year-old actor as "elderly'' ouch
she said that dating him had been an honour, but, ultimately, "It's hard
to be with a man so old, even Al Pacino."

Why are we so fascinated by age gaps? Over the years there's been
endless, prurient speculation about the 24 years separating Emmanuel
Macron and his wife, Brigitte, and the 25 between Michael Douglas and
Catherine Zeta-Jones.
